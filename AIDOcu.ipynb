    "# Automated Document Scraper for Multiple Formats\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Overview\n",
    "In this notebook, we build a document scraper designed to search the web, locate documents in various formats, and download them locally. This automated approach allows for the efficient collection and organization of a large volume of documents across multiple file types, including PDF, DOCX, TXT, CSV, and HTML, based on a specific subject area.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "The goal of this project is to create a tool that:\n",
    "1. **Takes a user-defined subject area** as input.\n",
    "2. **Searches the web** for documents related to the subject area, focusing on one file format at a time.\n",
    "3. **Downloads and organizes** the documents locally in a structured manner.\n",
    "4. **Processes** the content of each file, converting it to text format if necessary (e.g., PDFs and DOCX files).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will guide you through the steps involved in setting up the scraper, executing it, and managing the downloaded files effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to Follow\n",
    "1. **Input Subject Area**: You will be prompted to enter the topic or keyword related to the documents you wish to scrape.\n",
    "2. **Format-Specific Search**: The program searches Google for files of each specified format (PDF, DOCX, TXT, CSV, and HTML) relevant to the subject area.\n",
    "3. **File Download and Organization**: Files are downloaded into a specified directory, and their content is extracted if applicable (e.g., converting PDFs and DOCX files to plain text).\n",
    "4. **Error Handling**: The code includes error handling to manage issues like network errors, unsupported formats, or inaccessible URLs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "The following Python packages are used in this notebook:\n",
    "- `requests`: for downloading files.\n",
    "- `googlesearch-python`: to search Google for relevant document URLs.\n",
    "- `pdfplumber`: for extracting text from PDF files.\n",
    "- `python-docx`: for extracting text from DOCX files.\n",
    "- `pandas`: for handling CSV data.\n",
    "- `beautifulsoup4`: for parsing HTML content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please ensure these packages are installed by running:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "!pip install requests googlesearch-python pdfplumber python-docx pandas beautifulsoup4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Notes\n",
    "1. **Terms of Use**: Scraping Google search results and downloading documents must comply with the terms of service of the respective websites and Google itself.\n",
    "2. **File Organization**: All files will be organized in a local directory named \"downloaded_files\" within the notebookâ€™s working directory.\n",
    "3. **Scalability**: Adjustments can be made to the number of search results per file format to better suit the scale of your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing the setup, run the code below to begin the search and download process.\n"
