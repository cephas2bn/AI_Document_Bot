Correlations between As and U content, grain size and soil mineralogy were determined to identify contaminant fate and transport mechanisms. Soil samples collected near the mining source zone and up to 61 km downgradient of the minesites were analyzed. Samples were homogenized and wet sieved through polymer screens, and metal(loid) concentrations were determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis identified quartz as the primary mineral for all size fractions, with varying amounts of analcime, indicative of volcanic origin. Selected samples were examined for trace mineral composition using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The presence of Fe sulfides and Fe (hydr)oxides indicate heterogeneity in redox potentials on a microscopic scale. Elevated metal(loid) concentrations were associated with trace concentrations of Fe sulfide, indicating an influence on metal transport during weathering. Sequential chemical extractions (SCE) performed on source sediment fractions demonstrated that most As and U was adsorbed to Fe- and Mn-oxides and carbonates with lesser amounts bound by ion exchange, organics and Fe sulfides. Large changes in U/Th and As/Th ratios were observed to coincide with geochemical changes in the watershed, suggesting that metal(loid)-Th ratios may be used in environmental investigations to identify geochemically-significant watershed conditions.",,Available from http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2009.09.017,,,United Kingdom,2009-12-15,,English,Journal Article,,12,24,"Journal Name: Applied Geochemistry; Journal Volume: 24; Journal Issue: 12; Conference: 2008 Goldschmidt conference: Special symposium on the mineralogy and geochemistry of metalliferous minewasters in honor of Dr. John Jambor, Vancouver (Canada), 13-18 Jul 2008; Other Information: DOI: 10.1016/j.apgeochem.2009.09.017; PII: S0883-2927(09)00249-2; Copyright (c) 2009 Elsevier Science B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands, All rights reserved.; Country of input: International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)",,Medium: X; Size: page(s) 2246-2255,,,,Journal ID: ISSN 0883-2927; APPGEY; TRN: GB10R0466068765,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2009.09.017,,2012-12-11,21590774,
