On Mon 2023-08-21, we provided comments to the Ministry on its initial proposal, particularly the qualified persons for the different parts of the Mine Rehabilitation Code in Schedule 1 of Ontario Regulation 240/00 (Advanced Exploration, Mine Development and Closure Under Part VII of the Act).   
Regarding the September 8, 2023, proposal, we offer the following comments:   
1. The Ministry has proposed (page 8) to remove the certification requirement for the Mine Rehabilitation Code from the Regulation to a referenced policy.  With the introduction of the certification regime without Ministry oversight, we would recommend keeping the regulation as is, and monitoring the impacts before moving the Code to policy.   
 2.The inclusion of “engineering” in the “university degree in science or engineering from a post-secondary institution” for qualified persons in Parts 5, 6 and 9 of the Mine Rehabilitation Code (page 6) is concerning for PEO.  A qualified person should either be a licensed professional, who is accountable to the public through their respective regulator, or someone with a university degree plus some experience.  Including “or engineering” in the “university degree” requirement would allow unlicensed individuals who had a degree in engineering but who were not licensed by PEO to potentially practice professional engineering, which would violate the Professional Engineers Act.    
3.In the definition section of O.Reg. 240/00, we would prefer to replace “professional engineer” with  “licensed engineering practitioner,” which means a person who holds a licence, limited licence or temporary licence under the Professional Engineers Act.  This definition includes limited licence holders who can practice engineering within a limited scope, and is consistent with other legislation and regulations.  
As a co-regulator we are ready to review the regulation changes in confidence to ensure that it does not conflict with our Act or Regulations.

Ministry of Mines
RE: Proposed regulatory amendments required to implement legislative amendments made through Building More Mines Act, 2023 - ERO:  019-7598
Thanks for the opportunity to provide input to the proposed changes to the Mining regulations, in particular O. Reg. 240/00.  The comments below are provided in Order that they appear in Appendix A.
Changes to Certifications
1.	 New Up-Front Technical Certifications of Closure Plans – This is an important step toward efficiency, but it is important to ensure that anyone certifying a closure plan in anyway has a regulatory body that they are accountable to.  This is paramount or this approach will fail.  You can not rely on individuals to self-regulate.   The Ministry must not rely on individuals with a B.Sc. or M. Sc. and no professional designation to certify a closure plan.  You can not rely on individuals without professional designation to be honest about this or to ensure that they have adequate experience to review closure plans.  It is important that this is reconsidered. This is discussed more below.
2.	New Technical Certification for Alternative Measures – It is important to list the people who can provide technical certifications with their professional designations:  Professional Engineers registered with the Province of Ontario, Professional Geologists, or Professional Geoscientists. It is important to add Professional Geoscientists to this list, as this includes hydrogeologists, geochemists, etc.   This should not be left general as again, these engineers, geologists may not have a professional regulatory body that they are accountable to.  They may not be paying their dues and therefore are not accountable to any regulatory body.   Also, engineering disciplines have different skills which were acquired in school but then honed based on years of work experience.  For instance, Geological Engineers have much of the same training as Mining Engineers and/or Civil Engineers as an example.  But it is their work experience which has honed their skills and allows them to stamp and certify drawings/documents/reports.
3.	Changes to Certificates – Agreed. This makes sense.
4.	Corporate Certifications – Good.  You should also add that original signatures are not required on the same page or maybe not at all and electronic signatures are acceptable.
Who can give certifications?
This was a very difficult point to discuss with the OMA because there are many scientists and members of the OMA who think that they should be able to certify certain aspects of closure plans.  There are probably some that can but unfortunately, there will be many that will think that they can, but they do not have the relevant experience or the regulatory body to ensure that they do not certify something that they shouldn’t be certifying.  So, I do not agree with this position.  I truly believe that this will be a mistake.  I know that this is coming from me, as a Professional Engineer, but there is a reason why certifications are generally completed by someone with a professional designation.  Surface water, groundwater, and revegetation are some of the most important environmental components of closure plans.  I think that these are being over simplified, and they shouldn’t be.
As I indicate above, I do not believe that you should allow people without professional designations to certify any aspect of closure plans.  There are people who work in the professional and want to be able to certify closure plans but again, they have no regulatory body that they are accountable to.  Work experience does not replace the Code of Ethics which binds these people.
Surface water is still complex and must be thought about critically.  Despite years of experience, many technicians can not do this adequately and just determine that everything should be monitored.  It requires critical thinking and the ability to make decisions wisely to ensure that a monitoring program is appropriate for closure.  There are complex points to be considered, does the waste water still require treatment, what is the length of the mixing zone, what are the parameters of interest in this waste water, what waterbodies will/can be impacted by the site as closure.   It is important that this is considered from an overall environmental impact perspective.  This should be done by someone with a professional designation and accountability.  Part of the problem over the years is that too much power has been given to people without this level of training, accountability, ability to think critically, and experience that was necessary and it resulted in a system which was no longer functional.   O. Reg. 240/00 in fact was a good regulation, it is just that over the years the interpretation changed, and people chose to interpret it in ways in which it wasn’t intended.
Groundwater is a technically very complex subject which involves geology, overburden, bedrock (many different types), groundwater flow, drinking water aquifers, and groundwater chemistry.  It isn’t as simple as just putting some groundwater monitoring wells in a few locations.  This shouldn’t be certified by anyone other than Professional Engineers, Professional Geologists, or Professional Geoscientists.  The fact that groundwater is being considered for certification by someone with just a degree in science or engineering, with no professional designation, is not appropriate.  Groundwater monitoring wells must be placed very carefully, and the date interpreted carefully with many years of experience to ensure it is being interpreted correctly.   It is a bit scary to me that this is being considered.  This is not appropriate for someone without professional designation and accountability.
Revegetation is not as critical but again should be certified by someone with professional designation and accountability.
These certifications should only be done by those with professional designations and accountability.  Otherwise, there is no way to ensure that it is being done in a technical robust manner.  There may be a few environmental consultants who have sufficient scientific background to certify these aspects of closure plans but how will this be regulated.  There will be no mechanism for this without a regulatory body.  
Updating the Mine Rehabilitation Code
1.	Moving the Mine Rehabilitation Code to Policy – Good
2.	New Part – Infrastructure – Good
3.	Changes to Objective Statements – Part 1, Good; Part 2 and 3, Good. 
Part 5, surface water monitoring, needs to be discussed further.  This needs to be described very clearly, as discharging some water above Provincial Water Quality Objectives in perpetuity may result in a short mixing zone but that may have a much smaller environmental footprint than operating a water treatment system in perpetuity.  This is partly why I believe that surface water should be certified by a professional with accountability.  It isn’t as easy as just assigning some sampling locations.  It is much more complex than that.  The existing Code is well written and allows for mixing zones.  This should be preserved as often a short mixing zone represents the smallest environmental footprint.  This is not simple and needs to be thoroughly thought through and evaluated. This is the level of thinking which can not be done by someone with a university degree and 5 years of experience.  The person making these decisions and certifying the surface water monitoring program for closure must be able to make these types of determinations.  It is not as simple as just assigning some locations for surface water monitoring.  It is important that this subject is not over simplified.  
Part 7, metal leaching and acid rock drainage, again, this must be carefully considered as a management plan should only be necessary when it is established that leaving the materials in the state that they will result in an adverse affect.
Part 9, revegetation – Good.  I just think it is very important that waste rock, which is not metal leaching or acid generating, should not have to be revegetated, if there are no aesthetic issues.  A waste rock pile in a remote location, provides habitat for birds, reptiles, amphibians, insects, and small mammals.  If they are stable (chemically and physically) unless they are aesthetically displeasing, they should be left as they are.  
4.	 Specific Changes to Detailed Requirements – Good.  It is just important that it is clearly worded to ensure that mixing zones are still allowed as per the MECP’s ECA.  Possibly, this mixing zone should even be extended if the treatment can be removed.  There are some important considerations to be made here.  It isn’t as straightforward as what is presented but it is heading in a better direction.
Revegetation – Good
Conditional Filing – Good
Determining Compatibility with Adjacent Land or Alternative Future Uses -These amendments make sense.
Phased Financial Assurance – Good
Streamlining the Regulation – Good
Class of Facilities Exemption for Battery Mineral Concentrations
As I indicated in my previous submission, unlike other manufacturing facilities, battery mineral facilities will usually produce relative significant volumes of solid waste which will often be categorized as hazardous under the waste regulations.  If there is a solid waste stream produced it is important that this facility remains under the mining act, as managing hazard waste under the waste regulations can be very onerous. This is what sets batter mineral facilities apart from other manufacturing facilities which are currently not included in the mining regulations.  This should be considered very carefully as there was an important reason for them to be captured under the mining regulations.  I believe this is the reason and removing them will at times be extremely cost prohibitive for battery mineral facilities.
Please reach out if you have any questions regarding the above.  I look forward to hearing from you.
Yours truly,

93589,"in my professional capacity, on behalf of my organization",,"The Ontario Rivers Alliance (ORA) is a not-for-profit grassroots organization with a mission to protect, conserve and restore Ontario riverine ecosystems. The ORA advocates for effective policy and legislation to ensure that development affecting Ontario rivers is environmentally and socially sustainable.
Further to ORA’s 17 April 2023 submission regarding Bill 71, ERO-019-6715, ERO 019-6749 and ERO-019-6750, we are now writing to provide feedback on your refined proposals for the regulatory amendments in support of its goals.
The ORA did not support Bill 71 or the Build More Mines Act, 2023, which amended the Mining Act, or the proposed regulatory amendments to closure plans and rehabilitation requirements for advanced exploration and mine production. ORA also strongly rejects the regulatory amendments contained in this posting. 
Let’s be very clear, whenever streamlining occurs within the approval process, it will result in negative consequences to the environment and stakeholder safety. Therefore, the proposed amendments to the Regulation, as well as any consequential amendments, will all carry an environmental and safety risk. This narrow-minded approach to speed up development will impact entire communities and make our children and grandchildren’s survival on this already compromised planet even more challenging. 
It is a relief to hear that the proposal to delay the delivery of baseline studies will not proceed; however, these proposed amendments designed to provide flexibility and remove long-term commitments for project proponents will be at the expense of the environment and communities.
Please consider ORA’s recommendations on the proposed amendment details:
1.	Changes to Certifications:
1.1	New up-front Technical Certifications of Closure Plans:
ORA strongly rejects the proposal to replace the technical review of draft closure plans by Ministry staff with certification by ‘properly qualified persons’ chosen by the proponent. In our experience, Ministry staff are independent agents of the Ministry and not inclined to please the proponent with the hope of more work in the future.  This is purely an attempt to cut Ministry staff out of the process and would most definitely result in increased environmental impacts.
Ministry staff while having been hamstrung over the last 5 years, when allowed to regulate as was always their job, are very qualified and objective in their consideration of projects.
1.2	New Technical Certification for Alternative Measures:
Again, as above, ORA strongly rejects this proposal. This is a measure to exempt the proponent from the closure plan and rehabilitation measures if the “properly qualified person” can certify that the alternate measure meets or exceeds the objective of the applicable Part of the Code. It has been our considerable experience that employees or contracted consultants tend to work subjectively on behalf of the proponent, instead of remaining objective and serving the environment, the public, and stakeholders in their considerations.
1.3	Changes to Certificates:
It is crucial that the regulations include the requirement for a qualified technical professional to provide certifications guaranteeing that proper closure and rehabilitation have been completed once the advanced exploration or mining project has finished.  ORA objects to the removal of this requirement.
1.4	Corporate Certifications:
ORA has no objection to this amendment, as long as the proponent cannot wiggle out of their certification responsibilities.
2.	Who can give certifications:
For the reasons already set out in section 1 above with regards to any “properly qualified persons”, ORA strongly objects to anyone outside of the regulatory and professional regime from certifying any technical aspects of the closure or rehabilitation plan or its completion.
3.	Updating the Mine Rehabilitation Code:
It is a gross misrepresentation when the Ministry claims it “is not creating new standards, but rather clarifying the application of existing standards, or clarifying the methods by which the flexibility allowable under the Regulation and Code can be achieved”. In fact, the Ministry is relieving the proponent from long-term responsibility with weakened requirements for ensuring the long-term safety of the environment and stakeholders, which places both at considerable risk of safety.
3.1	Moving the Mine Rehabilitation Code to Policy:
Policy refers to a broad statement or set of principles or guidelines that guide decision-making and provide a framework for achieving specific goals and regulations; whereas regulations are specific, detailed rules and requirements that are derived from policies.  
Regulations are used to implement and enforce the principles and objectives set forth in the policies. Regulations have the force of law and are legally binding. Violating regulations can result in penalties or legal consequences.
There are numerous mining effluent-holding ponds in Ontario that must be continually monitored and maintained over the years to prevent leakage into local rivers and lakes. It is imperative that the government ensures that the public interests are protected from irresponsible and failing proponents who would abandon their responsibilities if given the opportunity.
Consequently, ORA strongly rejects the proposal to move mine rehabilitation code to policy.
3.2 – New Part – Infrastructure:
This proposal to leave machinery, pipelines, storage tanks and utility poles in the ground if stripped of hazardous material is letting the proponent off the hook once they have reaped the resources and profits from the land. This government is pandering to proponents and not protecting the interests of the public, stakeholders and Indigenous communities.
ORA strongly recommends this proposal to be more flexible in rehabilitating infrastructure is rejected.
3.3	Changes to Objective Statements:
ORA strongly objects to the ability of a “qualified person” to certify alternative measures or those proposed in Parts 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8 and 9, as they all weaken the requirements for a safe and healthy environment, and a fully rehabilitated mine site.
3.4	Specific Changes to Detailed Requirements:
Again, ORA rejects the proposal for a “qualified person” to certify anything in regard to mining.  
Mining effluent and tailings have an extremely high potential for pollution and heavy metal contamination that can be long-lasting and highly detrimental to the environment and stakeholders. Most mines and/or ore processing plants are in close proximity to creeks and rivers which can carry contaminants for hundreds of miles, impacting on countless lakes and rivers in its path for decades.
4.	Revegetation:
The proposal could allow the site to remain open if self-sustaining vegetation growth has not been established – which is very passive. The longer the site remains vegetation-free, the more pollution that will impact our freshwater resources.
ORA supports the free-standing requirement to revegetate all disturbed areas.  
5.	Conditional Filing:
ORA strongly objects to conditional filing orders as the closure plan is a key consideration when undertaking a mining project that will have severe implications for the environment and stakeholders if not properly carried out.
6.	Determining Compatibility with Adjacent Land or Alternative Future Uses:
There is no certainty for the public, stakeholders and Indigenous communities when a Minister can arbitrarily make an exception to a Code, or Regulation or specify how or if the requirements are applicable to individual closure plans. Therefore, ORA strongly objects to this proposal.
7.	Phased Financial Assurance:
This proposal is very unclear in this regard; however, ORA recommends that a proponent must be required to provide financial assurance for all mine hazards located on the site at any given time.
8.	Streamlining the Regulation:
Actually, this government does not deserve the trust of its constituents because it has eroded all of our environmental protections and public engagement and consultation in related policy and legislation over the last 5 years. Therefore, when it claims that “the intention is not to fundamentally change the underlying rules but rather to clarify their source and application”, it is unbelievable - no longer credible - trust has been lost.  Especially since this proposal and the entire Build More Mines Act, 2023 was a total gutting of the Mining Act.
While streamlining mining legislation and policies can bring about certain benefits such as increased efficiency and reduced bureaucracy if done correctly; excessive streamlining without adequate safeguards can impact the environment, communities and even the long-term sustainability of the mining industry.  It will also lead to environmental degradation, community displacement and conflicts, social and economic imbalances, and undermine public trust with the lack of transparency and accountability.
To avoid these negative consequences, it is essential to strike a balance between streamlining mining regulations for efficiency and ensuring that there are robust environmental, social and legal safeguards in place. Proper consultation with local communities, adherence to international best practices and strict enforcement of responsible mining standards are crucial for achieving sustainable and responsible mining practices. This is not the case with any of these amendments. 
Consequently, ORA rejects this proposal to streamline the Regulation.
9.	Class of Facilities Exemption for Battery Mineral Concentrates:
The mining of battery mineral concentrates must not be exempted from the Build More Mines Act, 2023.  Minerals are mined from the ground, therefore, there should be no exception or exemption for minerals used for batteries.  The processing of ore does not always happen at the mine site; however, nickel, cobalt, manganese sulphates, lithium carbonate, lithium hydroxide and spheronized graphite mining typically involve open-pit mining and chemical processing.  
The environmental and public health impacts of processing compounds for battery production can be significant and must be subject to strong regulation and mitigation efforts.  It is essential for companies and governments to adopt responsible practices and for consumers to support environmentally friendly technologies and recycling programs to minimize these impacts. 
An effective closure and rehabilitation plan must be required to protect the environment and stakeholders.  
10.	Other Housekeeping and Administrative Amendments:
10.1 – References to the Director of Mine Rehabilitation Changed to Minister:
In one sentence Appendix A states the proposal that the regulation would remove decision-making from the Director of Mine Rehabilitation and transfer it to the Minister, which would “improve decision-making transparency by having one identified decision maker”, and in the next paragraph it states, “the Minister would have the flexibility to delegate day-to-day decision-making to others within the Ministry”.  This is contradictory and is not an effective argument in supporting the proposed amendment.
ORA strongly objects to the proposal and recommends that a Director of Mine Rehabilitation with credentials as a professional engineer and/or a professional hydrologist must be the ‘qualified decision maker’/s and/or delegate/s to the Minister.
10.2 – Instruments Prescribed under the Environmental Bill of Rights:
The ORA will comment on any proposal under the Environmental Bill of Rights on any new instrument in this regard.
10.3 – Other Minor Amendments:
ORA strongly objects to any amendment that would allow for a ‘qualified person’ to replace a ‘qualified professional engineer” or a “professional qualified in hydrology”.
Consistency and clarity are crucial to policy and legislation; however, it is unacceptable when environmental protections and public safety are compromised with this degree of streamlining. These proposed amendments drastically undermine the Mining Act and the new weakened Build More Mines Act, 2023, and ORA recommends their complete withdrawal.
