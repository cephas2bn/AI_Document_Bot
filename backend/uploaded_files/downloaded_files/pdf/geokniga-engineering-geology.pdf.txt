Preface
It is said that one who learns from one’s own experience is smart, but one who learns from other’s
experiences is smarter. This book is the outcome of the author’s several years of experience of
working on diverse projects in India and abroad. This book attempts to share his rich and varied
experience with students—the future geologists and engineers—so that they are better able to
assess and handle the geotechnical problems of different project sites effectively. The book is
written in an Indian context using exhaustive examples from Indian case studies to elucidate
the theoretical concepts discussed in the chapters and to help in solving practical problems. The
investigative approach including techniques of site works discussed in this book are in line with
those practised by the geologists of the Geological Survey of India (GSI) while collaborating with
engineers in planning, designing, and constructing varied engineering projects across the country.
Initially, geological problems related to civil constructions were handled by geologists
of GSI. But with time civil engineers started working hand in hand with geologists to fi nd
solutions to the numerous geotechnical problems encountered in different engineering projects.
Thus, gradually engineering geology became an important subject of study especially for civil
engineering professionals.
Like any new branch of study, engineering geology has also advanced at a fast pace. In
fact, engineering problems and adverse conditions of project sites faced during construction
of civil engineering projects were treated successfully by Indian engineers and geologists.
The advances in the nature of geological works are also more pronounced compared to the
early days. New methodologies such as satellite imagery and remote sensing techniques, and
exploratory works using rotary drilling now provide accurate geological knowledge of both
surface and subsurface strata. But our progress in using computers in geological works is yet
to develop as in the western countries. In the West, IT based working in engineering geology is
part of the curriculum. The future of engineering geology lies in the applications of geographic
information system (GIS), remote sensing information provided by orbiting satellites, and IT
based 3D imagery systems.
About the Book
This textbook aims to impart comprehensive knowledge of engineering geology to the
undergraduate students of civil engineering and graduate and postgraduate students of geology,
applied geology, and mining geology. It will also serve as a reference book for practising civil
engineers and professional engineering geologists. The book deals with both the principles
and practices of engineering geology. Because of the author’s rich experience of working
with various types of engineering projects such as dams, tunnels, bridges, and having been
involved in disaster management activities in cases of natural calamities across the world such
as earthquakes, landslides, and tsunamis, he has focussed on the practical aspects that will come
in handy for geology students.
The subject matter of each chapter is elucidated with the help of maps, diagrams, and images
including fi eld pictures mostly taken by the author during his visits to different parts of the
world. Factual data related to different aspects of discussions has been incorporated in the form
of tables for ready reference. Solved examples wherever applicable have been included in the
chapters. The important points covered in the chapters are recapitulated in the form of summary

viii ● Preface
at the end of the chapters. Further, a section on exercises comprising review questions, multiple-
choice questions, and numerical exercises is also provided at the end of each chapter.
Several books, websites, and literature on engineering geology including journals of the
Indian Society of Engineering Geology (ISEG) and journals of the International Association of
Engineering Geology (IAEG), and published records of GSI on geological works of the past till
date were consulted while preparing the text of this book. The references of all these pertinent
books/papers with author’s name, year of publication, and other relevant details have been
listed in the ‘References’ section at the end of the book.
Salient Features of the Book
• The book provides examples of various geological sites in the country to give an Indian
context to the book. It also closely follows the works done by GSI, the premium institute in
India involved in geological works in the country.
• The subject matter of each chapter has been illustrated by numerous fi gures and actual
pictures of geological features taken from project sites to simplify the concepts discussed in
the book.
• Chapter-end summary is provided in each chapter so that at a glance student can recollect the
main aspects of the chapter.
• Geological reports are an important part of a professional geologists’ work. A chapter is
devoted to providing guidelines on writing good geological reports for designing project
sites.
• The appendices at the end of the book include case histories of major Indian dams and tunnels.
The discussion on the different types of hurdles which arose during their construction and
the remedial measures adopted will be of special interest to practising civil engineers and
professional geologists.
• Many parts of the world and several states of India—especially the eastern region and parts
of central India—have problems related to karstic limestone, where special investigations
such as speleological and tracer studies are necessary. This important aspect, which does
not fi nd mention in most other engineering geology books, is discussed as an exclusive
chapter.
Content and Coverage
The book consists of 24 chapters and two appendices.
Chapter 1 introduces engineering geology with a discussion on the importance of engineering
geology in civil engineering and the work-activities of engineering geologists. Chapters 2, 3,
and 4 deal with rocks, minerals, and rock structures and weathering of rocks and its impact on
constructions. Chapter 5 discusses the different types of soils and their classifi cation. Chapter 6
deals with soil mechanics—laboratory analysis of soil, determination of soil permeability,
density measurement, and consolidation and compactness tests.
Chapter 7 discusses the hydraulic parameters of a river followed by its activities and
the utility of the river deposits. Chapter 8 highlights the geological works of oceans and
coastal management. It also includes a case study on coastal erosion. Chapter 9 analyses the
various aspects of subsurface water in relation to its engineering signifi cance. The processes
involved in the hydrologic cycle to maintain the earth’s water equilibrium are also discussed.

Chapter 10 highlights the importance of rock mechanics in engineering geology and civil
engineering works.
Chapter 11 discusses the different stages of investigation of engineering project sites.
Different methods of geophysical explorations are also discussed. Chapter 12 discusses different
types of rock materials including their characteristics and utilities. Petrological study of alkali-
reactive minerals and other deleterious materials are also discussed. Chapter 13 discusses
the different aspects of grouting in rocks and other materials. It also discusses the types of
grouting, ingredients used in a grout mix, grouting patterns, and factors considered for fi nding
the effi cacy of grouting.
Chapter 14 explains the different aspects of dams, their utility, functions, investigation
approaches during site selection, and construction stages as also post-construction stages. It
also discusses different types of spillways and their working. Chapter 15 deals with reservoirs,
their effect on the geo-hydrology of the neighbouring area, the sedimentation and degradation
process of reservoir capacity, and the environmental effect due to the creation of a reservoir.
Chapter 16 classifi es different types of tunnels, before explaining the geotechnical aspects of
tunnel construction, problems in tunnelling and their solutions, and methods and machineries of
tunnel construction. Chapter 17 deals with different types of powerhouses and their functions.
Some case studies on power houses are also discussed. Investigation methods for nuclear and
thermal powerhouses are also presented.
Chapter 18 on bridges explains the functions of superstructures and substructures of bridges.
It describes the different types of bridges and the forces acting on them. The bridge components
and supports systems are also elucidated. A case study on bridge foundation problems and their
remedial measures are also presented. Chapter 19 deals with highways, canals, runways, power
channels, and fl umes. Chapter 20 discusses natural hazards such as earthquakes and tsunamis
and explains the methods of forecasting them. The chapter also adds a note on the various

Chapter 21 discusses landslide evaluation and mitigation. It also talks about geological,
man-made, and natural causes of landslides and the preparation of landslide hazard zonation
map and mitigation measures. Chapter 22 is on karstic terrain investigation. The origin of
karst topography and processes responsible for formation of large cavities in surface and
subsurface investigation methods including speleologist study of underground caverns are
discussed in this chapter. The chapters also adds a note on the problems of creating reservoirs
in karstic terrains.
Chapter 23 presents guidelines for writing geological reports. The fi eld work required
to collect basic data to be included in such reports is also discussed. Chapter 24 deals with
physiography, stratigraphy, and ores and minerals of India. Without adequate knowledge
of these aspects, the engineering geology study especially in the Indian perspective will be
incomplete.
Appendices A and B include examples of some Indian dams and tunnels successfully built
in various rock formations in different parts of India including the Himalayan terrain. These
appendices highlight the adverse geological conditions encountered during the construction
of these engineering structures and the remedial measures adopted. Chapter 14 on dams and
Chapter 16 on tunnels may be read in conjunction with Appendices A and B respectively to
impart knowledge on the adverse geological conditions of the construction sites of major dams
and tunnels and their rectifi cation measures.

1.1 INTRODUCTION
This chapter introduces the fi eld of engineering geology and highlights its
importance in civil engineering practice. It also brings to light the use of rocks
by Indians for engineering works since prehistoric times by providing evidence
from archaeological structures and writings in ancient books. The chapter traces the
history and development of engineering geology and work-activities of geologists
in the construction of dams, tunnels, and other engineering projects. The chapter
further discusses the involvement of Indian geologists with engineers in various
engineering projects of the country and their role in the remediation of natural
hazards.
1.2 ENGINEERING GEOLOGY
Engineering geology is an applied branch of earth science. It involves the application
of knowledge of geosciences to ensure safety, effi cacy, and economy of engineering
projects. It is primarily devoted to the study of rocks and soil and underground
water. This is essential for proper location, planning, design, construction, operation,
and maintenance of engineering structures. In addition, engineering geology is
associated with the assessment and implementation of corrective measures for a
wide variety of natural and man-made hazards.
1.2.1 Defi nition and Application
According to the statutes of International Association of Engineering Geology
(IAEG) 1992, ‘Engineering Geology is the science devoted to the investigation,
study and solution of engineering and environmental problems which may arise
as the result of the interaction between geology and the works and activities of
Chapter_01.indd 1 10/18/2012 9:39:06 PM
2 ● Engineering Geology
man as well as to the prediction and of the development of measures for prevention or
remediation of geological hazards’. Simply put, the science of geology applied to relevant
aspects of engineering practice is engineering geology.
In general, engineering geology is concerned with the properties of materials such as
soil and rocks used in engineering projects, including the quantitative assessment of their
strength, permeability, and compactness. These properties help in the selection of sites for civil
engineering structures. Engineering geology uses data, techniques, and principles of varied
branches of geology to study the surface and subsurface materials for evaluating their origin,
distribution, and effects on engineering constructions. ‘Engineering geological investigations
of Geological Survey of India (GSI) involve application of geomorphology, economic geology,
geohydrology, stratigraphy, structural geology, petrology and mineralogy besides geophysics’,
observed Krishnaswamy (1972), the well-known engineering geologist and former Director
General of GSI. In recent years, the fi eld of engineering geology has expanded and encompasses
rock mechanics, soil mechanics, satellite remote sensing, earthquake zoning, seismotectonics,
and geohazard management.
1.2.2 Geology vs Civil Engineering
There are several branches of science that enables the study of the earth’s features. Geology
is the most important branch in the family of earth science. The different branches of geology
deal with the history of earth’s origin, the materials in its interior, and the physical processes
that take place within it, especially plate tectonics. Knowledge of geology is necessary
to study fossils in rock formations and to reconstruct the plant and animal world of remote
past. However, geology for civil engineering work primarily involves activities related to
rocks and soil occurring in the top crustal layer of the earth (to a depth of only a few hundred
metres).
In a sense, the scope of a geologist and that of a civil engineer while working on a project
are the same; both work towards construction of safe structures for the benefi t of human beings.
The mutual relationship between the two disciplines—geology and civil engineering—gave
birth to the applied science of engineering geology that uses geological information combined
with practice to assist civil engineers in solving problems that require such knowledge. Whereas
geology deals with the history and structure of the earth, civil engineering focuses on the earth’s
surface.
In civil engineering practice of all major constructions, the geology of the sites and its bearing
on engineering structures are properly evaluated and taken into consideration in the design for
ensuring both economy and safety. ‘Geology stands to Civil Engineering in the same relation
as faith to work. The success or failure of an engineering undertaking depends largely upon the
physical conditions within the province of geology and the works of the engineer should be
based on the faith of the geologist’, observed Professor Boyd Dawkins, FRS (Balasundaram,
1982).
1.3 IMPORTANCE OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY IN CIVIL ENGINEERING
Knowledge of engineering geology is crucial to detect potential geological problems of a
project and to identify their rational solutions. A country’s progress depends on its technological
development along with proper utilization of its natural resources. As a result, constructions
of various engineering projects are envisaged having large fi nancial investment. During
Chapter_01.indd 2 10/18/2012 9:39:07 PM
Introduction to Engineering Geology ● 3
construction activities, it is a common practice to seek advice regarding geological problems of
the project site from personnel with adequate knowledge in geology. This helps to ensure safe
construction of the projects.
Engineering geology contributes to the development activity of a country that necessitates
construction of high dams, large reservoirs, long tunnels, railways, highways, and several other
engineering structures. All these civil engineering constructions are closely associated with the
geological environment, and as such engineering geological works are of utmost importance.
The success and economy of engineering constructions depend upon the understanding of the
degree and extent of geological problems and their solution.
There may be various geological attributes that create construction problems in a site for
an engineering structure. Engineering geological work of a project site at various stages of
construction aids engineers to evaluate detailed geological conditions of the site and assess the
suitability of the site for design of the structure for construction. At the early stage of a project,
it aims to fi nd the suitability of the site for the proposed structure. During the planning stage,
the work analyses and evaluates the site conditions by surface and subsurface investigations,
including exploratory drill holes. At the construction stage, it provides constant help to civil
engineering activities by identifying geological defects and suggesting measures for their
rectifi cation.
Thus, as Deere (1973) has rightly said, ‘Engineering geologist is not responsible for the
presence of adverse geology of a site but he is responsible for fi nding out that such adverse
features do occur’. In fact, the engineering geological investigation is taken up to detect all the
defects of a site and record them in a clear manner understandable to engineers for adopting
suitable corrective measures and designing a stable structure.
Engineering geology strives to achieve stability, safety, and economy in constructing civil
engineering structures. In the present set-up, engineering geology and civil engineering work as
a team with mutual cooperation and the common goal of contributing their knowledge for the
development work of the country.
1.4 ENGINEERING PRACTICE WITH ROCKS AND SOILS IN ANCIENT INDIA
Geology deals with rocks and soil; their proper utilization requires technical skill or knowledge
of engineering. The following subsections provide evidence that Indians were adept in the art
of engineering constructions using stone and soil even during the Stone Age and early historic
time.
1.4.1 Prehistoric Time
Stone Age Indians were knowledgeable in selecting hard and durable stones. They developed
techniques for making tools and weapons of various designs from these stones for their domestic
use and hunting (Fig. 1.1). They used natural caves for shelter after removing the fallen rock
chunks or excavating the rock ledges. Later, they learnt the techniques of making wall-like
structures with the help of earth, boulder, and stone slabs.
The broad circular masonry structures constructed by the Stone Age man using stone slabs
to protect against cold wind and wild animals can be seen even today at the Bhimbetka caves
in Madhya Pradesh. Through the succeeding ages, the knowledge and skill passed to next
generations who learnt the art of using cut and dressed stones and the techniques of fabrication
for masonry construction.

Fig. 1.1 Domestic tools and hunting weapons used by Stone
Age Indians: (a) ring stone; (b) blade; (c) celt; and (d) hand axe
In fact, both rocks and earth (in the form of brick) were used for various construction
purposes about 5000 years back, as is evident from the ancient cities of Sindhu–Saraswati
(Harappa) civilization that extended over many
parts of central, northern, and western India.
Archaeological excavation has unearthed
relics of brick houses, stone-lined drains,
and irrigation channels from these ancient
cities. It also brought to light a stone masonry
dam at Dholavira, an ancient city in Gujarat,
constructed in the third millennium BC for
storage and supply of water to the people. The
dam and storage structure (Fig.1.2) having a
wide base with step-like features was made of
hand-dressed stone blocks quarried from a local
Fig. 1.2 Masonry dam and storage structure at
hillock and used local materials including clay
Dholavira in Gujarat
as mortar (Gangopadhyay 2002a).
1.4.2 Early Historic Time
Many engineering structures were built in India during the early historic times. Megasthenes
(nearly 300 BC), the Greek ambassador to India wrote about the presence of sluice structures
constructed for distribution of water to the people. Starting from the second century BC,
Indians built hundreds of large rock-cut caves (underground chambers) (e.g., Ajanta, Ellora, and
Elephanta) and numerous majestic monuments
such as the stupas, temples, and monolithic pillars
(e.g., Sarnath in Bihar and Sanchi in Madhya
Pradesh). These structures stand testimony of
the expertise of early Indians in the fi eld of rock
architecture and stone masonry works. Figure
1.3 shows the Sanchi stupa in Madhya Pradesh,
which was constructed in the second century BC
using hand-dressed Vindhyan sandstone blocks.
Embankments, bunds, and canals were
constructed in the Cauvery valley as early as
the fi rst century AD. The Great Anicut across

irrigation and water supply is an example. The 12 m-high Mudduk Masur dam in South India
built in AD 1500 is a notable example of earth dam construction. Archaeological studies
have revealed that throughout the early historic time, royal palaces, temples, and forts of
unique architectural design were constructed in India using dressed blocks of durable rocks
and burnt-clay bricks.
1.5 HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY IN INDIA
William Smith, who prepared a geological map in 1813 and also guided a canal construction in
England, is known as the father of geology as well as of engineering geology. It was observed
by Krynine and Judd (1957), that the collapse of St. Francis Dam in the United States in 1928,
with loss of many lives, raised the awareness of geology in engineering practice in the US and
other parts of the world. However, the concept of engineering geology was known in India since
long ago as is evident from ancient books.
1.5.1 Concept of Manasara Silpa Sastra
There are several ancient books written in Sanskrit by Manasara, Mayamata, Visvakarma,
Santakumara, and Srikumara that laid down rules on construction. Of these, Silpa Sastra
on architecture and sculpture by Manasara (Acharya 1973) written in the sixth century AD
contains guidelines on varied aspects of construction in the form of sutras. In this ancient book
(sutras 198–211), rocks have been classifi ed into three groups which is similar to the modern-
day classifi cation of rocks.
Silpa Sastra also contains guidelines for selection or rejection of rocks. For example, sutras
269–275 suggest that friable, porous, decomposed, stained, and easily erosive rocks are to
be avoided for building purposes, whereas stones possessing sonic property equivalent to the
sound of a jewel box or bell metal are to be considered as good quality stones for construction
works. Compaction of soil and dewatering of foundation have been recommended in case of
construction in soil. This work of Manasara is probably the earliest document in the world that
deals with the concept of engineering geology with respect to properties of rocks and their use
in engineering constructions (Gangopadhyay 2002b).
Indians have applied the techniques of engineering geology successfully in many of the
civil engineering projects starting from mid-1800s. During this period, several long canals and
dams were constructed for utilizing the water resources of the big rivers for irrigation and water
supply, for example, the Ganga canal, Godavari canal, and Krishna canal were completed as
far back as 1854–55. GSI has been associated with the engineering geological activity of the
country since 1852 starting with Thomas Oldham’s investigation of a railway alignment from
Kolkata (then Calcutta) to Patna.
1.5.2 Activities of Geological Survey of India
Geological investigation for tunnel sites started in India as early as 1869, when T. Oldham
conducted feasibility study of a traffi c tunnel below river Sindh. In 1888, R.D. Oldham
investigated land stability problems in the Nainital area of Kumaun Himalayas. His work on the
Assam earthquake of 1897 was the fi rst of its kind in the fi eld of seismological study in the world
(Oldham 1899). The Khadakwasla dam in Maharashtra (see Appendix A.6), a high masonry
gravity structure, was a landmark construction in 1879 and helped irrigating the country for
eight decades; it is considered to be the fi rst of its kind in the dam-building history of the world.
Chapter_01.indd 5 10/18/2012 9:39:07 PM
6 ● Engineering Geology
The fi rst hydroelectric project (micro hydel) of India was constructed at
Darjeeling in West Bengal in 1897. Detailed engineering geological works
in the construction of large dams in India date back to 1888–89 when GSI
geologists carried out feasibility studies and rendered advice on the foundation
conditions of the Mari Kanive dam site in Mysore and Bhavanisagar dam
site in Tamil Nadu. As many as 105 engineering geological investigations
were carried out in different types of projects during the fi rst half of the
twentieth century, covering many major dam projects such as the Bhakra,
Thungabhadra, Yamuna, Mettur, and Pench. In addition, several railway
alignments, bridge sites, and landslides were also investigated during this
period.
While serving in GSI, Dr J.B. Auden (Fig. 1.4), the renowned engineering
Fig. 1.4 Dr J. B. Auden
geologist, established the Engineering Geology Division of GSI in 1945 to
assist in various civil engineering projects of the country. Since then, geological problems that
arise in engineering projects are handled by the geologists of this specialized branch. Today,
a team of over 100 trained engineering geologists of GSI are associated with all major civil
engineering projects of the country. They are also involved in the evaluation and mitigation of
natural/geological hazards such as earthquakes and landslides.
1.6 WORK-ACTIVITIES OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGISTS
Engineering geologists require specialized knowledge that is directly applicable in various
engineering works involving rocks and soil. Their services are required in all large civil
engineering constructions of the central and state governments. They are involved in
selecting sites for engineering structures such as dams, reservoirs, power houses, bridges,
and airports and in fi xing alignments for construction of tunnels, highways, and railways,
especially in hilly and hazardous geological terrains. Engineering geologists assess the
conditions of the foundation for these structural sites based on the mechanical properties
and stability of the rocks or unconsolidated materials that will bear these structures. Their
main function is to fi nd the potential geological hazards of these sites and suggest corrective
measures.
As Balasundaram and Rao (1972) state in their study, in India, ‘complex problems of site
selection, evaluation of foundation condition and treatment, assessment of the availability of
construction materials and study of reservoir competency necessitated constant attention and
advice from geologist. For timely fulfi lling of these tasks adequately, resident geologists were
posted for the fi rst time at the project site commencing from 1947’. In fact, in all major projects,
resident engineering geologists work with the engineers from the initial stage of a project until
its completion. They are to be associated with the day-to-day construction work of a site to
detect the geological condition with the progress of excavation for the foundation and suggest
remedy for immediate action. Foundation exploration is done under their guidance to reveal
subsurface conditions and obtain specimens from depths.
The strength parameters of rocks and the soil of foundation including subsurface samples are
determined by instrumental testing of specimens in laboratory and in special cases by in-situ
tests. Such geotechnical data helps engineers in the planning and design of the structures and
in the estimation of the overall cost of the project including possible treatment of geologically
weak zones. Engineering geologists evaluate the terrain conditions of an area for development
Chapter_01.indd 6 10/18/2012 9:39:07 PM
Introduction to Engineering Geology ● 7
works including construction of building complexes and other utility structures. They study
the dangers of landslide and subsidence and fi nd measures to arrest potential slides. They
also investigate areas affected by natural calamities such as earthquakes, fl oods, and tsunamis
and advise the planners and administrators about the possible means of avoiding such
dangers.
Engineering geologists investigate the groundwater or geohydrological condition of a
terrain. The construction of a dam disturbs the groundwater regime. If a storage structure
is constructed in areas with cavernous limestone or other highly permeable rocks, serious
leakage may take place. Hence, engineering geologists study the possible changes in
groundwater conditions due to the rise of groundwater level in storage areas and its effect
on the project so that it may be considered in the planning and design stage. At times, they
also advise on the probability of tapping groundwater for irrigation and drinking purposes.
Engineering geologists should also determine whether overdrawing of groundwater will
cause subsidence or sagging of land.
In recent times, a new dimension has been added to the role of an engineering geologist
that involves the study of environmental problems associated with engineering constructions.
Human actions due to engineering constructions or other development works bring changes in
the geological environment of the landform. Development works change the land pattern of
a country to suit the purpose of human society. For example, cutting a natural slope for road
construction leads to immediate change in its land surface, sometimes creating conditions for
landslides on the hill slopes. In fact, all construction activities create disturbances in natural
equilibrium and cause artifi cial alteration of the surface.
Before undertaking a project engineers and engineering geologists need to understand the
factors that control the geological processes so to minimize the destructive effects of human
action. Large-scale destruction takes place due to mining and civil engineering constructions
that change the landform and the natural environment. Controversy may arise when a certain
engineering construction is aimed for the benefi t of the public though it brings an imbalance
or loss of equilibrium of natural environment/condition. In such an event, an engineering
geologist may be the best judge as to how to create a harmony between the environment and
the construction activity.
1.7 FORUM OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGISTS AND ENGINEERS
The Indian Society of Engineering Geology (ISEG), established in 1965, is devoted to developing
a spirit of professional activities among engineering geologists and engineers of the country
by way of interaction among them through several seminars and symposia. The Society also
publishes a journal of its own. In the inaugural session of the Society in 1966, Dr D.N. Wadia
expressed his confi dent hope that ‘Indian Society of Engineering Geology will in the years to
come play an important role in the national economy of India and it will provide a forum for
Indian geologists and engineers to work together in framing a planned programme for building a
new India’. Since then, ISEG has been publishing its journal that serves as a guide to understand
the problems of civil engineering projects being constructed under varied geological conditions in
different parts of the country. It also highlights the recent activities of the engineering geologists
and engineers associated with various development works of the country.
ISEG also issues biannual newsletters aimed at promoting and encouraging the advancement
of engineering geology. This is achieved by collecting, evaluating, and disseminating the data
Chapter_01.indd 7 10/18/2012 9:39:07 PM
8 ● Engineering Geology
generated and results obtained in engineering, geological, and civil engineering activities and
assessing the impact of such activities on the natural and living environment. ISEG, which has
already completed 46 years, is also a national group affi liated to the International Association
of Engineering Geology (IAEG).
1.8 RECENT ADVANCEMENTS IN ENGINEERING GEOLOGY
Recent years have seen advancement in the work approach and techniques in handling problems
associated with engineering geology. Of late in India the trend in engineering geology work is
on the application of digital techniques. The modern trend in engineering geology in advance
countries such as the US, Europe, and Japan is dominated by digital data collection, utilization,
and display. A famous US engineering geologist observes that ‘engineering geologists will
be challenged by the task of quantifying variability and uncertainties in observations and in
interpretations. Interpreting and communicating the relevance and distribution of earth materials
and identifying and quantifying hazardous natural processes takes on increasing importance for
sustainable development’.
Today, sophisticated instruments are being developed for virtual geological mapping using
three-dimensional laser scanning and terrestrial photogrammetry. Geographic information
system (GIS) technology is being applied in the fi eld even for small-scale projects and uses
pen-based computers equipped with global positioning system (GPS), satellite receivers, and
wireless communication for seamless data management. Traditional geological maps are being
replaced by digital three-dimensional models attributed with geotechnical data.
Application of information technology (IT) to various aspects of engineering geology from
data requirement, handling, and processing to numerical and GIS modelling and visualization
is another modern trend well applied in countries such as the Netherlands, Sweden, and
Denmark. With the advancement in the fi eld of IT, these countries have developed digital
methods to support effective and effi cient execution of their work. Such methods are utilized
in slope stability calculations and understanding the behaviour of soil and rock tunnelling and
of earthworks.
Engineering geology is also used in creating database for large engineering geological
project works, spatial data integration of two-dimensional modelling by GIS, and visualization
techniques. In general, IT is being used in the following areas:
• Digital analysis of stream control transmission protocol (SCTP) data
• Digital description of borehole logs
• Digital fi eld book for collection of engineering geology data
• Three-dimensional digital outcrop mapping
In Amsterdam, a tunnel project has been successfully constructed below the city by using
IT techniques in the geological investigation. Moreover, in a tunnel and bridge project to link
Denmark and Sweden, three-dimensional GIS technology was successfully used for excavation
approach. However, India is yet to start applying digital techniques and IT in geotechnical works.
A very recent and encouraging trend in our country is that, in addition to Central and
State governments, many companies providing engineering services have started appointing
engineering geologists for their services related to engineering geology works. Some of these
companies are involved in complicated geotechnical problem solving, which will necessitate
the application of modern technology.

2.1 INTRODUCTION
The crust of the earth is composed of three major rock types. This chapter traces the
genesis of these rocks providing examples of their occurrence in India. It provides
the classifi cation of the three major rock groups and a description of the rock types
under each group. The chapter further provides an account of the various minerals
including their physical properties and crystal forms. It illustrates the geological
timescale of various rock formations of India along with equivalent absolute time
in million years. The chapter also elucidates the identifying characteristics of all
common rock types specifi ed.
2.2 MAJOR ROCK TYPES AND THEIR ORIGIN
The earth’s crust is composed of various types of rocks. These are of primary
importance in engineering constructions because of their use as building materials
and as foundation for engineering structures. The engineering properties of these
rock types can be attributed to the different ways in which they originated. The
rock types develop varied engineering properties because of their origin in different
ways. Depending upon the nature of origin, the rocks of the earth are divided into
three major groups—igneous rocks, sedimentary rocks, and metamorphic rocks.
2.2.1 Igneous Rocks and Intrusive Bodies
Igneous rocks are formed from the cooling and solidifi cation of hot and fl uid mass
of rock called magma that exists in the interior part of the earth. Molten rock from

as lava during volcanic eruptions. Intrusion of

(hypabyssal) resulted in the formation of
S
igneous bodies such as batholiths, laccoliths,
phacoliths, lopoliths, and so on, which
extend over a large part of the earth’s crust
(a) (b)
(Fig. 2.1). The magma of near-surface origin
is less viscous compared to that of deep-
seated condition and it intrudes (fl ows) rather
rapidly through cracks or bedding planes of
pre-existing rocks to form dykes and sills
after cooling. Dykes are discordant bodies
that cut across the bedding of country rock
(i.e., rock native to that area), whereas sills
(c) (d) are concordant bodies occurring parallel to
the bedding planes, see Fig 2.1 (b), where
Fig. 2.1 Intrusive igneous bodies: (a) batholith;
(b) phacolith; (c) laccolith; and (d) lopolith D stands for dyke; S for sill and L for
lava fl ow.
The different types of intrusive igneous bodies can be described as follows:
• Batholith is a very large discordant igneous body ranging from tens to hundreds of square
kilometres in size. It can be spread irregularly over great depths.
• Phacolith is a concordant igneous body that appears crescent shaped at its surface.
• Laccolith is an intrusive igneous body that has a concordant relation with the country rock
(native rock) and appears like a dome at its upper part.
• Lopolith is an intrusive igneous body that maintains a concordant relationship with the
country rock and exhibits saucer-shaped appearance at the ground.
Most igneous rocks are composed of an interlocking collection of crystals that grew as the
magma cooled. The crystals have random orientation; the slower the magma cools, the larger the
crystals. When the magma is deep seated inside the earth, cooling is slow and crystallization takes
considerable time; hence, the rock is coarse grained. As the molten material slowly rises towards
the surface, it begins to cool due to the change in temperature and pressure. Crystal formation
within intrusive igneous material can take place over millions of years. If the magma is closer to
the surface and intrudes through cracks in the crust (as in dykes), the cooling and crystallization
process is comparatively rapid and the rock thus formed is fi ne-to-medium grained.
Thus, the nature of crystallization and formation of rocks depend on the mode of occurrence of
the magma and cooling process. In the case of extrusive igneous rocks formed from solidifi cation
of lava at the surface, the cooling is so rapid that there is no time for crystallization, resulting
in very fi ne textured rocks that sometimes appear like glass. Igneous rocks that originate from
rapid cooling of lava under surface conditions are called volcanic rocks. The vast area of the
Deccan Trap in India is formed of volcanic rocks created by lava fl ows.
In the coarse-grained igneous rocks, the average crystal size is greater than 2 mm across
and this can be identifi ed by naked eye. The crystals in medium-grained igneous rocks with
an average size ranging between 0.25 mm and 2 mm need a hand lens for their identifi cation.
Chapter_02.indd 12 10/26/2012 7:47:32 PM
Rocks and Minerals ● 13
The fi ne-grained igneous rocks with crystal size less than 0.25 mm require petrological
microscope to fi nd the nature of composition and size of crystals. However, there are exceptions
to these general characteristics of the igneous texture as follows:
• During the settling of crystals from liquid magma, there may be layering in orientations.
• Volcanic rocks that are erupted explosively (pyroclastic rocks) are made of crystalline
fragments or glass.
• Pegmatite possesses very large size crystals even though the rate of cooling of the magma is
rapid.
Irrespective of the nature of texture, igneous rocks are classifi ed on the basis of the proportion
of total silica (SiO ) in their composition, which is known from chemical analysis of the rocks.
2
The overall chemistry of a rock is determined by the silica minerals it contains. The more silica
a rock has, the more acidic it will be. Hence, on the basis of silica content, igneous rocks are
classifi ed into acidic (or felsic), intermediate, basic (or mafi c), and ultrabasic (or ultramafi c).
Acidic igneous rocks These contain more than 66 per cent silica. The constituent minerals
of these rocks are alkali feldspar, quartz, and plagioclase feldspar in abundant amounts with
muscovite, biotite, and amphibole in subordinate amounts. Granite, a coarse-grained igneous
rock, rhyolite, a fi ne-grained rock, and rhyolite tuff, a pyroclastic rock, are examples of acidic
igneous rocks.
Intermediate igneous rocks The silica content in these rocks is between 52 per cent and
66 per cent. Minerals such as plagioclase feldspars are abundantly present in these rocks with
biotite and amphibole in smaller amounts. An example of coarse-grained intermediate rock is
diorite and that of fi ne-grained is andesite.
Basic igneous rocks In these rocks, the silica content is less than 52 per cent (quartz is
absent) and the rocks contain mostly plagioclase feldspar and pyroxene with olivine. Gabbro is
a coarse-grained basic igneous rock and basalt is fi ned grained.
Ultrabasic igneous rocks In this type, the silica content is less than 45 per cent and the
minerals are mainly olivine and pyroxene.
2.2.2 Sedimentary Rocks
Sedimentary rocks are derived from pre-existing igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic rocks.
All existing rocks are subjected to the actions of water, wind, and ice that result in decay
and disintegration of the rocks and formation of sediments. This process is called denudation
of rocks. Transportation and deposition are the processes that carry the sediments from one
place to another until their fi nal settlement generally in rivers, lakes, and oceans. Sedimentary
rocks may be composed of clastic or non-clastic materials. The loose sediments of clastic
nature, after compaction, cementation, and stratifi cation, form the clastic sedimentary rocks.
Digenetic changes such as intrastratal solution, cementation, and formation of concretion play
an important role in stratifi cation.
In case of sediments of chemical origin, the materials are dissolved by circulating water and
carried as solution to sea or lake where they are precipitated into the fl oors. After solidifi cation,
they are mixed with the remains of sea organisms and give rise to the non-clastic sedimentary
rock. Decayed products of fl ora deposited with the sediments are responsible for the formation
of strata with peat, coal, and lignite deposits. These depositional characteristics of sedimentary
Chapter_02.indd 13 10/26/2012 7:47:33 PM
14 ● Engineering Geology
rocks by detrital grains or by precipitation from solution in water help to easily distinguish
them from the igneous and metamorphic rocks from textural grounds. This is because the
grains composing them are non-interlocking fragments rather than interlocking crystals. The
sediments formed by precipitation do have interlocking crystalline textures, but are made of
minerals that are quite different from that of igneous rocks, notably calcite (in limestone) or
evaporite minerals such as gypsum.
Sedimentary rocks provide information on the history of deposition and palaeo-environment.
The knowledge of origin of plants, animals, and man is obtained from the study of fossils
embedded in sediments. The most prominent
primary structure of sedimentary rocks is the
bedding or stratifi cation of varying thickness
as well as composition. Depending upon the
depositional environment, several other primary
structures are developed in sedimentary rocks
such as graded bedding, ripple marks, mud cracks,
and cross laminations. The secondary structures
are provided by chemical actions forming geodes,
vugs, solution concretions, and so on.
The initial dip of the sediments deposited
on a nearly fl at surface is usually horizontal.
However, if the depositional surface is inclined,
the sediments are deposited at an angle. The
maximum initial dip of a bed formed by deposition
of the sediments on an inclined surface is about
Fig. 2.2 Vindhyan sandstone hill, Madhya Pradesh
45°. Later deformation may create steeper dips.
In engineering geological studies, the angle and disposition of dipping beds are important with
respect to possible sliding. The sedimentary rocks of Vindhyan formation in India (Fig. 2.2) are
famous for architectural works from the prehistoric time and are even now used as construction
material in various engineering projects.
2.2.3 Metamorphic Rocks
Metamorphic rocks are formed by the metamorphism of pre-existing rocks under high
temperature and pressure conditions or by chemically-active fl uids bringing about both
physical and chemical changes in the original rocks. A metamorphic rock may show remnants
of the earlier rocks from which it has been formed under pressure–temperature conditions;
such a rock is called xenolith. The pattern of change depends upon the grade of metamorphism
controlled by the pressure–temperature conditions. The change is not as apparent in low-grade
metamorphism as in high-grade metamorphism. In general, metamorphism takes place within
a temperature range of 100°C to 900°C generated from the intrusion of plutonic rocks. The
pressure comes from the huge thickness of overlying rocks or forceful intrusion of plutons and
plate collisions. Hot water and other fl uids associated with magma react with surrounding rocks
to bring about chemical changes.
The two most important types of metamorphism are contact or thermal metamorphism
and regional metamorphism. In contact metamorphism, country rocks react with intrusive
igneous bodies causing changes in the surrounding rocks as a result of the heat generated
from intrusion or injection of magmatic fl uids. The rocks produced by contact metamorphism
Chapter_02.indd 14 10/26/2012 7:47:33 PM
Rocks and Minerals ● 15
are restricted to areas close to plutonic (deep-seated) bodies. Regional metamorphism affects
large regions such as the Precambrian shield and also cores of folded mountains. All common
metamorphic rocks such as gneiss, schist, phyllite, and slate are produced by regional
metamorphism.
There are several other types of metamorphism that produce rocks having restricted fi eld
occurrence. For example, pyrometamorphism is evident from the presence of xenoliths in
some dykes of basalt. Cataclastic metamorphism
is recognized in limited rock outcrops showing
plastic fl ow or rupture without recrystallization or
chemical change of original rocks. Retrogressive
metamorphism brings about the conversion of
high temperature minerals into an assemblage
of stable minerals at low temperature. Turner
and Verhoogen (1987) have mentioned about
dislocation metamorphism that produces rocks
such as mylonite and phyllonite found in areas
of extreme deformation such as large fault zones.
Such rocks produce adverse effects if present in
Fig. 2.3 Metamorphic rock (mylonite) showing
the foundation of an engineering structure due to
pre-existing slip plane fi lled with quartz vein between
their genetic weakness caused by shearing effect,
two xenolith bodies (where a pen is kept)
shown in Fig. 2.3; see also Figs 3.2 (a) and (b).
During metamorphism, the effect of pressure causes growth of new crystals or reorientation
of previously existing crystals to layers commonly known as foliation. Foliation causes splits in
rocks and hence has an important bearing in engineering geology related to metamorphic rocks.
Some wavy surfaces or cleavage may also develop. On the basis of foliation, metamorphic
rocks are classifi ed into the following types:
Slate Fine grained; foliation is very closely packed.
Phyllite Fine grained; wavy or crenulated surfaces having sheen caused by small fl akes of
mica or chlorite.
Schist Coarse to medium coarse; undulating planes with abundant mica. Depending on the
constituent minerals, this rock is designated as hornblende schist or garnet mica schist.
Gneiss Coarse; widely spaced foliation than schist, mainly occurring with bands of dark and
light minerals in thin layers.
Migmatite Coarse; poor foliation showing signs of having begun to melt.
Metamorphic rocks of igneous origin do not develop foliation and the rocks are termed
hornfels. New minerals do not always develop after metamorphism. Thus, quartzite formed
from sandstone contains recrystallized quartz and marble contains interlocking calcites that
were present in limestone.
Pre-existing rocks undergo important changes after metamorphism due to heat and pressure.
This process of change is known as metamorphic facies. In thermal or contact metamorphism,
when granite intrudes a rock with silty and clayey composition, it forms a rock which is hard
and splintery called hornfels. Farther away from the edge of the granite body, a new mineral,
sillimanite having the composition Al SiO , is developed by contact metamorphism with the
2 5
sediments. Even farther, with changing pressure, temperature, and depth, another mineral,

2 3
of granite intruded in a rock of silty and clayey pressure is high enough (higher than 3 kilobars or
composition 3000 atmospheres). Sillimanite, andalusite, and
kyanite are typical minerals and their presence is indicative of their origin from metamorphic
rocks including the approximate pressure–temperature conditions of origin. For example, the
presence of kyanite indicates that metamorphism took place at a temperature range of 400°C to
800°C, pressure of more than 3 kilobars, and depth 10 km below the surface.
In general, thermal metamorphism is caused at the proximity of hot intrusion. In regional
metamorphism, the pressure, and hence depth (as the two are related), and the temperature
prevailing regionally are of importance. Low pressure–high temperature metamorphism occurs
close to continental crust and lithosphere, but high pressure–low temperature metamorphism
occurs near the plate boundary (the collision zone) with oceanic crust and upper lithosphere.
The metamorphic minerals formed under different facies of regional metamorphism will depend
mainly upon the original composition of the rock undergoing metamorphism. Table 2.1 gives a list
of the different facies of regional metamorphism and the new minerals formed from the original
rocks of silty and clayey composition (as in sedimentary rocks) and from basaltic igneous rocks:

2.3 CLASSIFICATION, DESCRIPTION, AND ENGINEERING USAGE OF IGNEOUS ROCKS
A detailed petrological classifi cation that depends upon the chemical analyses and microscopic
examination of rocks is beyond the scope of this chapter. ‘No one classifi cation of rocks can
be regarded as ideal for all purposes. Schemes designed for use in petrological research are
generally too sophisticated and rely on characteristics that are unsuitable for everyday practical
use’, observed Hatch, A.K. Wells and M.K. Wells (1984). It is, however, necessary to ensure
Chapter_02.indd 16 10/26/2012 7:47:33 PM
Rocks and Minerals ● 17
that the nomenclature of a rock remains the same to an engineer as to a geologist. Hence, a
simplifi ed scheme of classifi cation is presented in this chapter for each of the three main rock
groups mentioning only the main rock types of each group (Tables 2.2–2.4). Igneous rocks are
classifi ed based on the mode of their formation with respect to depth (plutonic) and whether
they are extrusive in character.
2.3.1 General Observation and a Simplifi ed Classifi cation
The main minerals in igneous rocks are quartz, feldspar, mica, amphibole, pyroxene, and olivine.
Depending upon the mineral content and mode of occurrence, a simple classifi cation of igneous
rocks is presented following Blyth and Fereitas (1967) for practical use in engineering geology
(Table 2.2). The rocks are arranged under four different headings, namely acid, intermediate,
basic, and ultrabasic types. The acid type is composed of light-coloured rocks with dominance
of quartz and subordinate feldspar. The rocks of basic type are dark coloured and contain
mainly feldspar and ferromagnesian minerals. The intermediate type contains both light- and
dark-coloured minerals and spare quartz. The two rocks under ultrabasic type are olivine-rich
rocks. The details of these rocks (physical features, mineralogy, and so on) including their
engineering use are given in the description.

2.3.2 Colour and Texture
The mineral content in igneous rocks depends upon the nature of the magma from which
they have originated. If the magma contains high silica, the rock will be light coloured with
a dominance of quartz. On the contrary, rock formed from basic or low-acidic magma is dark
coloured. If the rock has been formed in a deep-seated condition (plutonic), the slow cooling of
the magma produces coarse-grained minerals with well-developed crystals. The sudden cooling
of an extrusive rock results in fi ne-grained minerals and glass. In addition to mineral content,
the size of the grain and the texture of the igneous rocks are characteristic features for their
identifi cation. Gabbro, dolerite, and basalt can be identifi ed from their coarse, medium, and
fi ne textures, respectively, though they are all dark-coloured rocks of nearly same composition.
The texture of an igneous rock refers to the pattern of grain arrangement. If the rock exhibits
grains in the form of large crystals, it has pheneric texture. If the crystals are not well devel-
oped, the rock is fi ne grained, and if the ground mass is glassy in nature, it is said to have an
Chapter_02.indd 17 10/26/2012 7:47:33 PM
18 ● Engineering Geology
aphanitic texture. The arrangement of feldspar in a basaltic rock is called ophitic texture. The
texture is termed porphyry when large crystals called phenocrysts are embedded in a fi ne-
grained matrix. The porphyry texture is generally found in rocks of hypabyssal origin. Slow
cooling forms large grains, whereas sudden cooling as in the case of an extrusive rock results
in fi ne grains and glass. Some structures such as vesicles, as seen in basalt, are characteristic
features of rocks of volcanic origin.
2.3.3 Description and Engineering Usage
The following pages give a brief description of some of the important types of igneous rocks
such as granite, pegmatite, dolerite, peridotite, and so on.
Granite
Granite is a medium-to-coarse grained, light-coloured rock with white or pink tint according
to the colour of the feldspars (Fig. 2.5). When examined under the microscope, the rock is
found to contain essentially quartz, feldspar (orthoclase, plagioclase,
and microcline), and ferromagnesian minerals such as hornblende
and mica (Fig. 2.6). The accessory minerals include apatite, rutile,
zircon, and magnetite. Granite with large crystals of potash feldspar
embedded in comparatively fi ne-grained groundmass is known as
porphyritic granite. Granitic rock in which feldspar is abundant is
called monzonite. If plagioclase content is more than orthoclase,
it is known as granodiorite. In engineering geological description,
the common name ‘granite’ is used without making distinctions
such as monzonite or granodiorite. The rock is hard and durable
and possesses high strength; it is suitable for use as construction
material. Fresh granite outcrop provides excellent foundation
conditions for engineering structures. However, porphyritic granite
with large feldspars when weathered and decomposed may cause
weakness in the foundation. Granite occurs abundantly in peninsular

Rocks and Minerals ● 19
Pegmatite
Pegmatite is a very coarse-grained rock consisting mainly of feldspar, quartz, and mica. It occurs
as a vein or dyke or as a large rock body intrusive into granite. Minerals found in large crystals
in pegmatite result from the cooling of residual magmatic fl uid. Large books of muscovite
used in the industry are obtained from pegmatite. The pegmatite of Kodarma in Jharkhand is
famous for the large yields of ruby mica (muscovite) that are used in the electrical industry. The
decomposition of feldspar in pegmatite forms kaolin, which is very soft in nature and when
present in a foundation is considered to be a weak feature. Aplite containing aggregates of
sugary-grained quartz and feldspar are commonly associated with pegmatite.
Charnockite
Charnockite was fi rst found in India and is named after Job Charnock of the British East Indian
Company. This rock is similar to granite in physical and mechanical characteristics but differs
in mineralogical composition. It is blue to bluish grey in colour and is a medium-to-coarse
grained rock consisting mainly of quartz, feldspar (orthoclase and microcline), and pyroxene,
and subordinately magnetite, apatite, zircon, and rutile. Charnockites may also be metamorphic
in origin, in which case garnet, biotite, and ilmenite occur as accessory minerals. Charnockite
occurs in the Nilgiris and Anamalai hills of South India and parts of Eastern Ghats in Tamil
Nadu. It is well suited for foundation and construction purposes.
Syenite
Syenite is a medium-grained, light-coloured, and even-textured rock consisting essentially
of feldspar, hornblende, and mica, or pyroxene. This rock is of deep-seated (plutonic) origin
containing intermediate silica content and is high in alkali. A common variety of syenite is
nepheline syenite, consisting of a large content of nepheline. Syenite appears similar to granite
in hand specimen, but is not a common rock.
Diorite
Diorite is grey to greenish grey in colour. Diorite is a medium-to-coarse grained and even-
textured rock. It consists essentially of plagioclase feldspar and ferromagnesian minerals such
as biotite and hornblende or pyroxene. The percentage of ferromagnesian minerals present in
the rock equals or exceeds the feldspar content and hence the dark colour. If the rock contains
suffi cient content of quartz, it is called quartz-diorite. Diorite is a commonly occurring rock and
is used for foundation and construction purposes.
Porphyries
Igneous rocks (generally hypabyssal types) exhibiting large crystals (phenocrysts) embedded
in fi ne-grained groundmass are called porphyries. Thus, there are granite porphyries, diorite
porphyries, and so on.
Gabbro
Gabbro is a coarse-grained basic igneous rock consisting essentially of feldspar (plagioclase
and oligoclase) and ferromagnesian minerals such as pyroxene (mainly augite with very
little or no hypersthene). It is similar to diorite in appearance, but contains larger amounts of
ferromagnesian minerals. If the hypersthene content in gabbro exceeds that of augite, it is called
norite. If the mineral contents in gabbro are essentially plagioclase and labradorite with very
little augite, the rock is anorthosite. When fresh, the rock chips can be used for construction
of roads and for other engineering purposes. After decomposition, it develops weakness due to
Chapter_02.indd 19 10/26/2012 7:47:34 PM
20 ● Engineering Geology
alteration of olivine to serpentine and chlorite, and such altered or weathered gabbro is not to
be used for any engineering work.
Dolerite
Dolerite is a medium-grained basic igneous rock having the same composition as gabbro. It
originates from moderate depth and occurs as dyke, being an intrusive body in country rocks.
Weathering of the rocks with characteristic exfoliation gives rise to large spherical bodies
(appearing like boulders) with thin concentric shells. Dolerite is a very hard rock and is used for
engineering purposes, especially as road metal for its capacity to hold bitumen coating as a binder.
Peridotite
Peridotite is a medium- to coarse-grained, even-textured, and dark-coloured ultrabasic rock.
Olivine is the chief constituent of this rock. Other minerals include augite, hornblende,
biotite, and iron oxide. Felsic minerals are absent. Some varieties are composed entirely or
predominantly of pyroxene, hornblende, or olivine. Depending upon the mineral content, the
rocks are termed as pyroxenite (containing entirely pyroxene), hornblendite (containing entirely
hornblende), and dunite (containing entirely olivine). These rocks contain several accessory
minerals such as garnet, ilmenite, and chromite. The ultrabasic rocks may be rich in mineral
content including ores; if present at any project site, the deposit requires thorough investigation
to evaluate its economic importance prior to any construction in this rock.
Picrite
This ultrabasic rock is essentially made of olivine and augite or hornblende with little feldspar
(<10 per cent). Ilmenite occurs as an accessory mineral in this rock. With the increase of feldspar
and decrease in other constituents such as olivine, the rock grades into gabbro.
Basalt
Basalt is a fi ne-grained, dark-coloured basic igneous rock that originates from cooling of
volcanic lava fl ow (Fig. 2.7). When examined under the microscope, it is found to contain
mostly feldspars (plagioclase and oligoclase), pyroxene (augite), olivine, and iron oxide with

ophitic texture (Fig. 2.8). Glass, which is present in some varieties, makes the rock vulnerable
to chemical weathering. The Deccan basalt is also called trap rock or simply trap. There is
a vesicular variety known as amygdaloidal basalt containing secondary minerals such as
chalcedony, opal, agate, jasper, and zeolite inside the amygdular cavities. Basalt with these
silica minerals in high content may cause alkali aggregate reaction and hence using it as a
concrete aggregate should be avoided. The product of weathering of basalt is laterite, which is
widely used in engineering constructions of road and buildings (see Section 19.1). Chemical
alteration of the rocks produces certain minerals collectively known as ‘green earth’, which is a
deleterious material and hence should not be used for construction purposes.
Rhyolite, dacite, trachyte, andesite, and phonolite
These volcanic rocks are commonly known as felsites. They are very dense and homogeneous
and have fl int-like or glassy appearance. The main constituent minerals of these different rock
types are as follows: rhyolite—alkaline feldspars and quartz; dacite—lime-soda feldspar and
quartz; trachyte—alkaline feldspar without or with very little quartz; andesite—soda-lime
feldspar with little or no quartz; and phonolite—alkaline feldspar with nepheline. All these
volcanic rocks are very fi ne grained or glassy and light to pale grey in colour except andesite,
which is dark coloured. They are of common occurrence from volcanic eruption as lavas on the
surface and also partial intrusion through cracks in the earth’s crust.
Obsidian, pitchstone, and pumice
These are very dark-coloured glassy type of igneous rocks formed by rapid cooling of ejected
lavas from volcanoes. The mineral grains cannot be distinguished in these glassy rocks. If the
rock is vitreous in lustre and bright looking, it is called obsidian. When the lustre is dull and
pitchy, it is pitchstone. The pumice has an earth texture and dull look. It is spongy and very
porous. These rocks occur only in restricted areas, and if present in an engineering project site,
their weathering characteristics are to be critically considered.
Tuff and volcanic breccia
The ashes ejected with fragments from volcanoes are deposited on the surface. Consolidation of
these materials by natural processes form the rock called tuff. It is a light-coloured soft rock in
which volcanic ash content is dominant. After mixing with large quantity of angular and uneven
fragments from the surface, it forms volcanic breccia or agglomerate. The volcanic breccia
commonly present in the Deccan trap is associated with tuff beds.
2.4 CLASSIFICATION, DESCRIPTION, AND ENGINEERING USAGE OF
SEDIMENTARY ROCKS
The constituent particles of sedimentary rocks may contain silica-rich minerals or lime–
magnesia-rich minerals. Depending upon their composition, the sedimentary rocks are grouped
into two main divisions—clastic and non-clastic.
2.4.1 Simplifi ed Classifi cation
Sandstone and shale (clastic) and limestone (non-clastic) are the most common sedimentary
rocks. It has been established that 99 per cent of the sedimentary rocks belong to these types.
Depending upon the composition and size of the rock fragments or grains in clastic sediments
and the content of minerals in non-clastic types, a simplifi ed classifi cation is derived (Table 2.3).
Sandstones are further subdivided (Table 2.4) on compositional basis following Pettijohn (1957).

2.4.2 Texture of Sedimentary Rocks and Rounding of Particles
The texture, structure, and mineralogical and chemical composition of sedimentary rocks are related
to their origin and subsequent modifi cation. Texture is the pattern of packing of the particles in the
rock. Packing enforces the strength of the rock and hence has an important bearing in engineering
geology. The texture of the sedimentary rocks is related to the size of the grains. The various
sizes of the sedimentary rocks and their corresponding terms (column 2, Table 2.3) are adopted
following the Indian Standard. Rounding of the rock particles occur by one or more of the erosional
agents. Current and wave action are responsible for smoothening the grain corners and rounding.
The type of matrix or cementing material that binds the grains is an important criterion, especially
in identifying sandstones (Table 2.4). Short descriptions of the various types of sedimentary rocks
with special reference to sandstones of India are provided in the following subsections.
2.4.3 Description and Engineering Usage of Clastic Sedimentary Rocks
This section gives a description of sandstone and shale which are the major types of clastic
sedimentary rocks and also of greywacke, orthoquartzite, arkose, siltstone, and conglomerate,
which are subdivisions of sandstone.

Sandstones
Sandstones are the most dominant type of sedimentary rocks. They generally occur as layered
or bedded strata and vary in grain size from gravel to fi ne-grained sandstone (Table 2.3). They
contain quartz in varied proportions up to 95 per cent, with other minerals such as feldspar,
iron oxide, mica, and chloride occurring in subordinate amounts. Sandstones vary widely with
respect to their matrix, texture, porosity, and strength. If the matrix is siliceous, the rock will be
hard, compact, and possesses high strength. Sandstone with argillaceous and calcareous matrix
loses its strength if it remains saturated with water for a prolonged period.
Sandstone formations of India There are several sandstone formations in India that are sources
of construction material for various engineering projects. Vindhyan sandstones, which extend
over a large part of central India, are found in various colours such as red, mauve, buff, grey, and
mottle (Fig. 2.9). The rock consists of angular and subrounded quartz grains with tight packing
and cemented in siliceous matrix (Fig. 2.10).
Vindhyan sandstones possess high strength and
low porosity and are used for foundation and
construction purposes. Siwalik sandstones occur
in the foothills of the Himalayas. They are porous
and possess low strength. A variety of Siwalik
sandstone called sand-rock is excessively porous
and breaks down easily when saturated with
water. Gondwana sandstones are found in many
parts of eastern and central India. These are
medium- to coarse-grained rocks, generally of
low strength due to loose compaction of grains.
Tertiary sandstones with low strength and high
Fig. 2.9 Large blocks and chips of Vindhyan sandstone
porosity are available in large parts of Assam.
Cretaceous sandstones occur in the coastal belts
of India. These sandstones have argillaceous and
calcareous matrix that crumbles easily when
saturated with water for a prolonged period.
Greywacke
Greywacke is greenish grey or black in colour,
resembling partially weathered basalt. It consists
of angular-to-subangular grains of quartz and
feldspar and fragments of phyllite, slate, and
shale. The association of these rock fragments is a
criterion of its identifi cation. The grains are bound
together in a fi ne-grained matrix. Greywacke
may originate from sediments derived from
Fig. 2.10 Photomicrograph of Vindhyan sandstone
showing angular and subangular quartz grains plutonic and metamorphic rocks and sometimes
cemented in siliceous matrix (× 70) from detrital matters of a sedimentary terrain.
Orthoquartzite
Orthoquartzite contains 90 per cent or more of quartz sand. It is a light-coloured rock and
resembles quartzite. However, a close study may show that it is of sedimentary origin as it lacks
the interlocking texture, characteristic of a metamorphic rock. Orthoquartzite is commonly
Chapter_02.indd 23 10/26/2012 7:47:36 PM
24 ● Engineering Geology
called quartzose sandstone. The cementing material of the rock is mainly silica at places mixed
with minor content of calcareous matter.
Arkose
Arkose is light grey to pale pink in colour and consists of coarse and angular grains of quartz and
feldspar nearly in equal proportion. The grains are well sorted and derived from disintegration
of granitic rock. The rock also contains mica, iron oxide, carbonate, and clay in subordinate
amounts. If the feldspar content is more than 25 per cent, the rock is termed feldspathic sandstone.
Siltstone I
Siltstone is a light-coloured rock consisting mainly of sand particles with size varying between
2 microns and 75 microns. It also contains little amounts of coarser sand and clay. Siltstone
has a gritty feel, which is an identifying character in a hand specimen. Siltstones are generally
interbedded with shale and sandstone.
Shale
Shale is a soft sedimentary rock with thin layering or lamination along which it breaks easily.
This easily breakable characteristic of shale is called fi ssility. Due to high compaction, some
varieties of shale such as slate attain hardness. Shales vary widely in colour, from light grey
to dark grey and also white, yellow, brown, and black. The rock contains particles of both silt
and clay with clay-size particles (2 microns or less) being the maximum. If the clay percentage
predominates and there is no layering, the rock is called claystone or mudstone. Claystone beds
are frequent in the Siwalik formation. Shale and claystone contain clay minerals, which play a
signifi cant role in engineering geological investigations (Refer Sec. 5.8).
Conglomerate
This rock is formed from the consolidation of rounded boulders with siliceous, calcareous, or
argillaceous type of cementing materials. If the matrix is siliceous, it is hard and of high strength,
but when the rock contains other types of matrix such as clay, it becomes porous and breaks
easily when saturated with water. Depending upon the dominance in size of these rounded
rock fragments, the conglomerates are termed pebbly conglomerate or pebblestone, cobbley
conglomerate or cobblestone, and boulder conglomerate (Table 2.3). When the majority of
boulders in a sedimentary deposit are angular and uneven, the rock is termed breccia. When
boulders in large numbers remain embedded in clay, the resulted deposit is called tillite.
Conglomerate, breccias, and tillite are not suitable as foundation rocks as they crumble under
pressure in saturated condition and permit leakage of water through them.
2.4.4 Description and Engineering Usage of Non-clastic Sedimentary Rocks
Limestone is the major type of non-clastic sedimentary rock. Calcite is the dominant constituent
of limestone with dolomite and aragonite in subordinate amounts with occasional presence of
few quartz grains. When dolomite (mineral) content is more, the rock is called dolomite (rock).
The rock is found in different shades such as white, grey, yellow, brown, and black (Fig. 2.11).
Fossil shells are frequent in many varieties of limestone; for example, coral limestone and
foraminiferal limestone (Fig. 2.12). Limestone goes into solution and may form large caverns,
which are of great concern when present in a reservoir project. If hard and free from cavities,
the rock is suitable for foundation. Limestone occurs in Vindhyan, Cuddapah, and tertiary
formations of India.

Oolite, chalk, marl, and diatomaceous earth
Oolite is a variety of limestone consisting of
spherical concretions. Chalk is another white
variety comprising minute fossils of sea organ-
isms. When the carbonate rock is mixed with a
large percentage of clay, it is called marl. Diatoms
are unique forms of algae that grow silica shells,
which are preserved in water under sediments
after death. The stratifi ed product of diatoms is
the diatomaceous earth. All these varieties of
limestone and bio-fragmental deposits are gener-
ally soft and not suited for construction purposes.

2.5.2 Fabrics
Metamorphism brings about changes in the pre-existing minerals, which form new shapes,
generally fl at or elongated, under pressure and temperature conditions. Rearrangement of the
minerals in parallel orientation gives rise to the banded texture. If the minerals are platy or
columnar, their parallel orientation by regional metamorphism results in the texture called
schistosity (as in mica schists).When well-developed planes of schistosity alternate with less-
developed schistose planes, the fabric produced is known as foliation, which is a very distinct
feature of metamorphic rocks. The rock splits easily along this foliation plane.
Cleavage is a type of secondary foliation in metamorphic rocks consisting of closely spaced
parallel planes of weaknesses of potential partings. Argillaceous rocks under moderate stress
and increase in temperature form the slaty cleavage. Fabrics such as foliation, cleavage, and
interlocking grains are features that distinguish metamorphic rocks from sedimentary rocks.
The homogeneous texture of igneous rock changes when it is metamorphosed. Metamorphic
rocks consisting of quartz and feldspar under regional metamorphism develop granular texture.
Some minerals such as garnets have high strength of crystallization and develop large crystals,
called porphyroblasts, for example, garnet porphyroblasts.
2.5.3 Description and Engineering Usage
The following is a description of the engineering usages of the major types of metamorphic rocks.
Gneiss
Gneiss is a medium- to coarse-grained and banded or foliated metamorphic rock. When observed
under the microscope, it is found to comprise essentially quartz, feldspar, hornblende, and
micas and accessory minerals such as garnet, tourmaline, apatite, zircon, sphene, and magnetite.
Alternating bands of light and dark minerals are common in gneiss. The dark bands consist
mostly of biotite and amphibole and the white bands of quartz and feldspar. The characteristic
banding of this rock is due to the platy minerals such as micas and hornblende that are arranged
in thin planes or bands along which the rock splits easily. The gneisses are designated as biotite
gneiss, hornblende gneiss, or granite gneiss depending upon the mineralogical composition.
In general, the rocks are derived from igneous rocks such as granites, but may also be from
sedimentary rocks. The gneiss is a very hard rock and is suited for foundation of engineering
structures. It is widely distributed in India and very old in age. Archaean gneisses occur in many
parts of India, especially in the peninsular region and parts of the Himalayas.
Khondalite
Khondalite was fi rst detected in India and has derived its name from ‘Khond’, a tribal area
of Orissa. It is a light-coloured para-gneiss or para-schist consisting of quartz, sillimanite,
garnet, and graphite. Due to schistosity, the rock can be split easily. Khondalite is subjected to
alteration into laterite under natural processes. The rock occurs abundantly in the Eastern Ghats
and contains manganese ores.
Granulite
Granulite is an even-grained rock comprising mainly quartz, feldspar, pyroxene, garnet, and small
amount of mica. The rock is derived from high-grade metamorphism that imparts segregation
banding and alignment of fl at lenses of quartz or feldspars appearing like regular foliation to the
rock. The rock with coherent grains attains high strength and is suited for use in engineering work.

Schist
Q
Schist consists mainly of quartz, feldspar,
IO
M muscovite, and biotite (Fig. 2.13). Various other
F M minerals such as garnet, staurolite, kyanite,
sillimanite, epidote, chlorite, and talc are also

CH present in the rock. These rocks are named
Q
according to the presence of the fl aky or platy
F minerals, for example, mica schist, talc schist,
and chlorite schist. The rocks are of varied
F colours such as white, brown, yellow, and black.
These are derived from the metamorphism of
Fig. 2.13 Photomicrograph of schist (× 80): Q, quartz; igneous and sedimentary rocks. In schist, the
F, feldspar; M, micas; CH, chlorite; and IO, iron oxide micas and other platy minerals lie with their
mineral
cleavage planes parallel to each other to provide
the fabric called schistosity. The rocks are generally of low strength and split easily along the
planes of schistosity. However, it can be used for construction of houses, walls, and so on.
Phyllite
Phyllite is a grey-coloured rock characterized by glistering sheen derived from planes of partings
or surfaces lined with fi ne-grained micas. Two types of phyllite are common—arenaceous
(quartzitic) phyllite and argillaceous (shaley) phyllite. In the former, the grains are tightly
packed by siliceous cement and hence the rock is very hard. In the latter, due to the presence
of clayey matrix, the rock is soft though it has more sheen of mica. The rocks are derived from
sandy and clayey shale by low-order metamorphism. Arenaceous phyllite can bear suffi cient
load and is safe for structural foundation.
Slate
Slate is a fi ne-grained rock with a characteristic cleavage called ‘slaty cleavage’, which is a
new structure imposed by metamorphism. The rock can be split into big, smooth-surfaced
sheets along the cleavage planes. The rock is generally grey, green, red, and black in colour and
formed from intense metamorphism of clastic
sedimentary rocks such as shale and claystone.
Slate is a hard rock and is suited for foundation.
However, if it occurs on hill slopes, it can cause
damage as a result of breaking of large sheets of
rock along the cleavage planes that slides down
the slope. Large slabs of slates can be used for
various purposes such as construction of walls
and fencings.
Quartzite
Quartzite is white to light grey in colour. This
metamorphic rock consists mainly of recrystal-
lized quartz derived from metamorphism of sand-
stone. Quartz is the dominant content with iron
oxide minerals present as impurity (Fig. 2.14).
Fig. 2.14 Irregular blocks of quartzite Some varieties contain more than 90 per cent
Chapter_02.indd 27 10/26/2012 7:47:37 PM
28 ● Engineering Geology
quartz with feldspar and micas in small amounts. With recrystallization, the boundaries of
quartz become tight and interlocking assuming high strength. It occurs in various rock forma-
tions of India such as Dharwar, Aravalli, and Cuddapah. The rock is very hard and splits into
sharp edges. It is suitable for foundation and is also the most durable construction material.
Marble
Marble is the metamorphic equivalent of limestone. It is found in various colours such
as white, grey, and purple. It contains dominantly calcite and subordinately dolomite, iron
oxide, graphite, and some quartz. Marble possesses good strength and durability and is resist-
ant to meteoric weathering, but it is slightly
susceptible to chemical erosion. Marble occurs
in Dharwar, Cuddapah, and especially Raialo
in Rajasthan. Indian marble specially mined
from Rajasthan is well suited for use as build-
ing stones. Taj Mahal in Agra is made of chaste
white Makrana marble from Rajasthan. Polished
blocks of marble are used for decorative purposes
(Fig. 2.15).
Mylonite
Mylonite is a fi ne-grained rock with fl int-like
appearance. The rock shows banding or streaking
caused by extreme granulation and shearing
of coarse-grained rocks. It is the product of
dislocation metamorphism that disturbs the
banding or other structure of original rocks but
the groundmass may contain lenses of rocks in
elongated condition, also see Fig. 3.2(b). The
rock should not be used in construction sites due
Fig. 2.15 Polished marble block
to its inherent weakness caused by shearing.
Phyllonite
Phyllonite resembles phyllite in its outward appearance. It shows silky fi lms of newly
recrystallized micas or chlorite along the planes of schistosity. Phyllonite originates from
mechanical degradation or shearing by dislocation metamorphism of coarse-grained rocks such
as granite, gneiss, and greywacke. The rock is not suitable for any engineering construction.
Metabasic rock
Metabasic rock is the metamorphic equivalent of a basic rock (e.g., basalt, dolerite, and gabbro).
The fi ne-grained variety is the metabasalt, the medium-grained metadolerite, and the coarse-
grained metagabbro. The metabasic rock is hard and possesses suffi cient strength. It is also
known as epidiorite. The mineral composition of the rock remains the same as in basic rock
but the glass is altered forming minerals such as chlorophaeite and palagonite. When fresh and
hard, it can be used for construction purposes.
Laterite
Laterite is extensively used in many parts of India for building houses, culverts, bridges, roads,
and other engineering structures. It is a product of subaerial weathering in a monsoon climate
Chapter_02.indd 28 10/26/2012 7:47:37 PM
Rocks and Minerals ● 29
having alternate dry and wet seasons. It occurs as a porous mass, which is red, yellow, or brown
in colour, with a hard protective limonite crust on the exposed surfaces of the parent rocks.
Laterite may form from varieties of rocks, the end product containing mainly the hydroxides of
iron, alumina, and manganese. It is mostly found as an alteration product of the Deccan traps of
peninsular India, khondalites of Orissa, and capping bauxite in the Eastern Ghats.
2.6 ORIGIN AND CHARACTERISTICS OF MINERALS
All rocks are composed of minerals, which are homogeneous substances with fi xed chemical
composition, crystal forms, and other distinctive characteristics such as colour, lustre, and
hardness. The chemical elements and the crystal forms determine the properties of the minerals.
The chemical elements depend on the composition of the rock in liquid state. Crystals are
formed when a rock body passes from the liquid to the solid state. All minerals are solids
with the exception of metallic mercury and water which is considered to be a mineral. The
International Mineralogical Association (IMA) provides the following defi nition for a mineral:
‘A mineral is an element or chemical compound that is normally crystalline and that has been
formed as a result of geological processes.’
According to IMA, there are currently more than 4000 known minerals that occur in various
types of rocks. These minerals are formed under varied environments and in different ranges
of chemical and physical conditions such as pressure and temperature. The main group of
mineral formations is found in igneous rocks, in which minerals occur as crystalline products
formed from magmatic melt. In sedimentary rocks, the occurrence of minerals is the result
of weathering, erosion, and sedimentation processes. In metamorphic rocks, new minerals
are formed at the expense of the existing ones as a result of increasing temperature and
pressure or both on some pre-existing rock types. Minerals are also formed by hydrothermal
process in which they are chemically precipitated from solution. In the fi rst three types,
the minerals are interwoven with rocks as interlocking fabrics. Hydrothermal solutions
tend to follow fracture zones with open spaces in which minerals are developed with good
crystal forms.
Minerals may occur in rock formations in various forms such as metallic ores, industrial
minerals, gemstones, and rare minerals whose origin, occurrence, and grade are studied in
depth in economic geology. The rock formation of India has rich deposits of many metallic ores
and industrial minerals, a description of which is given in Chapter 24.
2.6.1 Crystal Geometry of Minerals
The crystal form of a mineral is the outward expression of the internal molecular structure,
which is dependent on the state of equilibrium due to the interatomic forces. Crystal geometry or
crystal morphology deals with the symmetry, faces, and forms of a crystal. A crystal possesses
the following three types of symmetry shown in Fig. 2.16.
Plane of symmetry It divides a crystal into two halves such that one half is the mirror image
of the other. A crystal may have one or many planes of symmetry or none.
Centre of symmetry It is the central point about which every face and edge of a crystal is
matched by one parallel to it on the opposite side of the crystal.
Axis of rotation symmetry It is a line or an axis through a crystal about which the crystal can
be rotated to bring it into an identical position a number of times in the course of one revolution.
Chapter_02.indd 29 10/26/2012 7:47:38 PM
30 ● Engineering Geology
Hexad axis of For example, if during the course of full
rotation symmetry rotation of 360° about an axis of symmetry
the crystal is brought into an identical position
six times, the axis is a six fold. Such axes are
Planes of termed diad (twofold), triad (threefold), tetrad
symmetry
(fourfold), and hexad (fi vefold).

In all, 32 combinations of symmetry elements
are recognized under seven crystal systems depending upon the possible planes of symmetry
and axes of symmetry. They are as follows:

Different crystal forms can be referred to the same set of crystal axes and hence belong to
the same crystal system. For example, cube, rhombdodecahedron, and octahedron are different
crystals of the same cubic system.
Each mineral crystallizes in one of the seven crystal systems. Figure 2.18 shows the outlines
of these crystal forms with names of the common minerals, that is, isometric (fl uorite),
tetragonal (zircon), hexagonal (beryl), trigonal (tourmaline), orthorhombic (olivine), monoclinic
(hornblende), and triclinic (albite feldspar). A mineral showing formation of crystals is termed
crystalline. If no crystal of any geometric shape is visible in the constituent minerals of a

intergrown or in contact together in a particularly
symmetric manner; such crystals are called twins.

2.6.2 Physical Characters of Minerals
All minerals are recognized by their physical characteristics, which are broadly divided into the
following categories:
• Crystal structure
• Specifi c gravity
• Light-dependent characteristics such as colour, lustre, and transparency
• Sensory characteristics such as odour, feel, and taste
• Heat conductivity characteristics such as fusibility and malleability
• Electricity and magnetism
• Characters dependent on cohesion and elasticity such as cleavage, fracture, and hardness
• Others such as tenacity, fl uorescence, and reactivity to acid
Chapter_02.indd 31 10/26/2012 7:47:39 PM
32 ● Engineering Geology
Crystal structure and habit These have already been described in Section 2.6.1. When a
mineral exhibits good crystal habit or form, it helps to identify the mineral. It may also be
granular with very fi ne crystals, which are visible only under the microscope.
Specifi c gravity The specifi c gravity of a mineral is a signifi cant characteristic for its
identifi cation. It is expressed as the ratio of the weight of the mineral to the weight of an equal
volume of water at 4°C. The specifi c gravity of a mineral can be determined in the laboratory.
It can also be readily known by referring to the standard table of a mineralogy book (Dana and
Ford 1948). The specifi c gravity of quartz is 2.65 and that of calcite 2.71.
Colour It indicates the appearance of the minerals in refl ected light or transmitted light for
translucent minerals. Many minerals show different types of body colours. Quartz, for instance,
is commonly white in colour but it may also be grey, yellow, or red. Iridescence is the play of
colours due to surface or internal interference. Labradorite (a feldspar of plagioclase group)
exhibits internal iridescence, whereas sphalerite often shows the surface effect.
Streak It refers to the colour of the mineral powder, which is different from the body colour. It is
the colour produced when a mineral is rubbed against unglazed porcelain. Magnetite is steel grey
but its streak is cherry red. This property is generally observed in minerals with non-metallic lustre.
Lustre It indicates the way a mineral’s surface interacts with light. Based on lustre, minerals
are broadly classifi ed into metallic and non-metallic. The latter can be further classifi ed into
pearly, silky, silvery, dull, and so on. The soft minerals, calcite and serpentine exhibit pearly
and silky lustre, respectively.
Odour, feel, and taste Some minerals have typical tastes such as bitter, sour, alkaline,
or saline. For example, common salt has a saline taste. Under certain circumstances, some
minerals exhibit odours such as sulphurous, bituminous, or argillaceous. For example, friction
or heat on pyrite generates a sulphurous odour. Serpentine and allied minerals when moistened
give an argillaceous odour. A mineral may have a characteristic feel such as soapy, greasy, or
harsh. Talc is well known for its soapy feel.
Fusibility and malleability A mineral is called fusible if it melts on application of heat and
malleable (e.g., gold) if it is fl attened when it is mildly hammered.
Electric property A mineral develops electricity by friction. Most of the gems are positively
electric in the polished state. When a crystallized body develops electric charge under pressure, it is
called piezoelectricity. Some crystals show positive and negative charges of electricity in different
parts with change of temperature. For example, on heating, quartz shows positive electricity at the
three alternative prismatic faces and negative electricity in the remaining three edges.
Magnetic property Magnetite exhibits characteristics similar to natural magnet. The magnetic
polarity is presumably developed in it by induction of the earth’s magnet. Some minerals are
attracted when brought close to a powerful magnet, for example, hematite, pyrrhotite, and
native platinum.
Cleavage It is the easily breakable plane along which the atoms are closely packed. When the
mineral is subjected to a blow, it breaks along this plane leaving a smooth surface. The cleavage
is termed basal, prismatic, pyramidal, and so on depending upon its parallelism with the crystal
face. In topaz, cleavage is developed parallel to the basal face and so it is termed basal cleavage.
Similarly, it is prismatic in amphibole and pyramidal in fl uorite.
Fracture A fracture is developed in a mineral by a sharp blow with a hard object. The resultant
surface is characteristic of the mineral and may be of different types such as conchoidal,
Chapter_02.indd 32 10/26/2012 7:47:39 PM
Rocks and Minerals ● 33
jagged, fi brous, or irregular. Thus, quartz develops conchoidal fracture that appears like
a concave surface. The hardness of a mineral is measured on the Mohs scale, as stated in
Section 2.6.3.
Brittle nature A mineral is brittle when it forms fragments or powder (e.g., quartz, calcite).
It is fl exible if it bends without fracturing and returns to its normal shape after the removal of
the force (e.g., some varieties of talc).
Elasticity The elastic property of some minerals is derived by its capacity to resist any
change in shape or volume when subjected to force. A muscovite is elastic, whereas phlogopite
is inelastic.
Fluorescence and tenacity Fluorescence is the response to ultraviolet light and tenacity is
the response to mechanical-induced changes of shape or form. Acid reaction is seen is some
minerals such as salcite, which produces effervescence with dilute hydrochloric acid.
2.6.3 Mohs Scale of Hardness
Of all the physical characters of a mineral, its hardness is of greatest signifi cance in engineering
geology. The strength and rigidity of a mineral is derived from its surface hardness, which is
defi ned as the resistance to abrasion offered by it. Ten relatively common minerals are selected
to represent various degrees of hardness in Mohs scale of hardness. Table 2.6 shows these ten
minerals arranged in the order of increasing hardness.

To determine the hardness of a mineral, it is to be scratched by the minerals shown in the
table to make a fi ne dent. For example, if a mineral cannot be scratched by fl uorspar but can
be scratched by apatite, its hardness is 4.5 in Mohs scale. In practice, the fi ngernail (H 2.6), a
copper coin/plate (H 3.5), penknife (H 5), and window glass (H 5.5) are used to fi nd the Mohs
scale of hardness of a mineral.
2.7 CLASSIFICATION OF MINERALS BASED ON CHEMICAL COMPOSITION
Minerals may be classifi ed based on their chemical composition. They are grouped and
described under 17 chemical divisions such as native elements, sulphides, oxides, carbonates,

silicates, phosphates, sulphates, borates, and nitrates as given by Dana and Ford (1948). Of
these, silicates are the predominant minerals in rocks of the earth’s crust. Carbonates, oxides,
sulphides, and phosphates are the other commonly found minerals. The following list provides
the classifi cation of all the common minerals according to their abundance:
• Silicate class
• Carbonate class
• Sulphate, phosphate, chromate, tungstate, molybdate, and vanadate classes
• Halide class
• Oxide and hydroxide classes
• Sulphide class
• Native element class
The following paragraphs provide a description of these mineral classes.
Silicate class
The fundamental structural unit in all silicates is the (SiO ) tetrahedron, in which a central
4
silicon atom (Si) is surrounded by four oxygen atoms (O) in a tetrahedral arrangement. The
bond between silicon and oxygen is very strong.
Silicates are the largest group of minerals found in rocks. Nearly 95 per cent of the rocks
contain silicon and oxygen in addition to aluminium, magnesium, iron, and calcium. As shown
in Table 2.7, the important silicate minerals are quartz, feldspars, pyroxenes, amphiboles, micas,

olivines, and garnets. The feldspar group alone (orthoclase, plagioclase [albite], oligoclase,
labradorite, bytonite, and anorthite) constitutes about 60 per cent of the crust and quartz nearly
10 per cent. The silica minerals are predominantly found in igneous rocks and metamorphic
rocks but are also found in sedimentary rocks.
Feldspar, pyroxene, amphibole, olivine, garnet, zircon, sillimanite, kyanite, staurolite, topaz,
epidote, muscovite, biotite, and tourmaline talc are the silicates apart from the silica mineral
quartz and opal (amorphous) varieties. The properties of many of these common silicate minerals
are described in Table 2.15 under the heading rock-forming minerals. Table 2.7 describes the
properties of the other minerals.
Clay minerals belong to a subclass of silicates called phyllosilicates, which are very fi ne
grained and possess swelling properties. They can be identifi ed by a study under electron
microscope and also by X-ray diffraction method and differential thermal analyses. The
properties of these clay minerals, which are of importance in engineering construction, are
listed in Table 2.8.

Carbonate class
The carbonates (CO ) class is isolated in structure and does not form chains, rings, or layers as

in silicates. The important minerals of this group are calcite and aragonite (calcium carbonate,),
dolomite (calcium/magnesium carbonate), and siderite (iron carbonate). Other carbonate
minerals include magnesite (magnesium carbonate), rhodochrosite (manganese carbonate),
smithsonite (zinc carbonate), witherite (barium carbonate), strontianite (strontium carbonate),
and cerussite (lead carbonate).
Rocks containing carbonate minerals such as limestone and dolomite are found in the
marine environment where shell and planktonic life are abundant. Carbonates are also
found in evaporatic settings and in karst region where the dissolution and reprecipitation
of carbonates form big cavities including stalactites and stalagmites (see Figs 22.2 and
22.4). Carbonate minerals also occur in metamorphic rocks as marble (calcium carbonate).
The nitrates and borate minerals also contain carbonates, which are mostly formed by

evaporation from salt lakes. Table 2.9 provides a description of the common carbonate
minerals.
Sulphate class
Sulphate is present in sulphate minerals as SO2−. The (SO ) tetrahedron is a complex anion
4 4
or group in which four O atoms are placed around a central S atom at the corners of the
tetrahedron. These tetrahedra are isolated in the structure and do not form groups, chains, or
layers as in silicates. Sulphate minerals are commonly formed in evaporatic settings where slow
evaporation of saline water allows the formation of both sulphates and halides at the water–
sediment interface. They also occur in hydrothermal vein system as gangue minerals along with
sulphide ore minerals. In addition, sulphates are obtained as secondary oxidation products of
original sulphide minerals.
The common sulphate minerals are anhydrite (calcium sulphate), celestine (strontium
sulphate), barium sulphate, and gypsum (hydrated calcium sulphate). The sulphate class also
includes the phosphate, chromate, molybdate, vanadate, and tungstate minerals. Table 2.10
provides a description of the minerals of this class.
Halide class
The halide group of minerals include simple compounds such as the natural salts fl uorite
(calcium fl uoride), halite (sodium chloride), and sylvite (potassium chlorite) in which the
halogen element is bonded to an alkali metal. Halides such as sulphates are commonly found
in evaporatic environment such as salt lakes and landlocked seas such as the Dead Sea and the

Great Salt Lake in the US. The halide group also includes the fl uoride, chloride, bromide, and
iodide minerals. Whereas the chlorides are formed mostly by evaporation from solutions, the
fl uorides are typically found in igneous rocks and their associated pegmatite and hydrothermal
veins. Table 2.11 provides a description of the halide class minerals.
Chapter_02.indd 37 10/26/2012 7:47:39 PM
38 ● Engineering Geology
Oxide and hydroxide class
Many of the mineable ores belong to the oxide class containing metallic minerals that are
compounds of oxygen and one or more metals. They are normally made up of chemical
structures of closely packed large oxygen atoms with the small metal atom. They also carry the
best record of changes in earth’s magnetic fi eld. They generally occur as precipitates close to
the earth’s surface and as oxidation products of other minerals in the near-surface weathering
zone. They are also found as accessory minerals in igneous rocks and metamorphic rocks of the
earth’s crust and mantle.
Common oxide minerals include hematite, magnetite (iron oxide), chromite (iron chromium
oxide), rutile (titanium dioxide), spinel (magnesium aluminium oxide), zincite (zinc oxide),
pyrolusite (manganese oxide), uraninite (uranium oxide), cassiterite (tin oxide), and ice
(hydrogen oxide). Owing to their great resistance to weathering and transport, they also occur
in sediments where they can be concentrated in beds.
In the hydroxides, oxygen is completely or partly replaced by the OH group. Hydroxides are
generally less hard and less dense than oxides. They typically occur in the upper weathering
zone of ore deposits produced by the alteration of the primary minerals. Some of the common
hydroxide minerals are gibbsite, Al(OH) ; manganite, MnO(OH); diaspore, AlO(OH); and
3
goethite, FeO(OH). The properties of important minerals of this class are described in Table 2.12.
Some of the common oxide minerals of this classes such as magnetite, hematite, ilmenite, and
spinel are described in Section 2.8 under ore-forming minerals and precious stones.

Sulphide class
The sulphides include a large number of minerals many of which are economically important as
metallic ores. A sulphide is basically an oxygen-free compound of sulphur and one or more metals.
Most sulphides have metallic character with a strong colour and streak and metallic lustre. Most
are also opaque. They have high densities, and in contrast to pure metal, they are mostly brittle.
The common sulphides are pyrite (iron sulphide), copper sulphide, chalcopyrite (copper
iron sulphide), nickeline (nickel sulphide), sphalerite (zinc sulphide), galena (lead pyrite), and
cinnabar (mercury sulphide). Table 2.13 provides the properties of minerals in the sulphide
class. Many of these sulphide minerals such as chalcopyrite, galena, pyrite, and sphalerite are
described in Table 2.16.

Native element class
The chemical elements that occur in the earth’s crust are few and none of them is in large
quantities. Some of these minerals such as gold, silver, and diamond are well known because of
their valuable properties. The element class includes native metals and intermetallic elements
(gold, silver, copper, mercury, platinum, and iron), semimetals, and non-metals (arsenic,
antimony, bismuth, graphite, sulphur, and tellurium). These metals are composed of spherical

cations such as Au+ in close packings, most of them in cubic closest-packed structure. This group
also includes natural alloys such as electrum (a natural alloy of gold and silver), phosphides,
nitrides, silicates, and carbides (which are found in nature in a few rare minerals). Table 2.14
gives a description of minerals of this class.

2.8 ROCK-FORMING, ORE-FORMING, AND PRECIOUS MINERALS
2.8.1 Rock-forming Minerals
Silicates, oxides, and carbonates are the main rock-forming minerals. Minerals that are the
dominant constituents of rocks are called essential rock-forming minerals. Quartz, feldspars,
amphiboles, pyroxenes, micas, chlorite, nepheline, olivine, serpentine, talc, calcite, dolomite,
gypsum, magnetite, and hematite are essential rock-forming minerals. In addition to these
minerals, there are others that occur in rocks in minor proportions. These are known as accessory
rock-forming minerals, which include garnet, tourmaline, epidote, zircon, apatite, rutile,
ilmenite, magnetite, hematite, pyrite, staurolite, kyanite, and sillimanite. Though occurring
as accessory minerals, many of them have an important bearing in identifying the rock. For
example, the presence of any of the minerals such as garnet, tourmaline, staurolite, kyanite, and
sillimanite is indicative of the rock being of metamorphic origin.
Chapter_02.indd 40 10/26/2012 7:47:40 PM
Rocks and Minerals ● 41
The rock-forming minerals can be identifi ed from their physical characters such as colour,
streak colour, lustre, crystal form, cleavage, hardness, and specifi c gravity. Though many of the
common rocks can be identifi ed by the naked eye or by use of a lens (× 10), some rocks require
to be studied in thin sections under the microscope. Microscopic study of a thin section of a
rock helps its accurate identifi cation from the determination of the constituent minerals, their
relative proportions, and texture. The chemical composition, crystal forms, and other important
characteristics of the rock-forming minerals are shown in Table 2.15.

After disintegration of a rock, many of its constituent minerals including accessory minerals
of high hardness (H > 6) may remain in sediments. For example, quartz, kyanite, sillimanite,
tourmaline, garnet, cordiarite, staurolite, zircon, alusite, beryl, spinel, topaz, chrysoberyl, and
corundum possess hardness between seven and nine in Mohs scale of hardness. Such minerals
of high hardness, if present in the river water used for hydroelectric power generation, may
abrade and damage the turbine of a hydroelectric power plant. The suspended silts of such
river water need petrological studies to determine the hardness of silt particles and its effect on
turbine blades. This aspect has been specially addressed in Section 12.7.
2.8.2 Common Ore-forming Minerals
There are several ore-forming minerals. Table 2.16 describes the most important ones that are

2.8.3 Precious and Semiprecious Minerals
Minerals used as precious and semiprecious stones are associated with crystalline schists and
gneisses. Pegmatite also contains large crystals of gem minerals. Transparency, hardness,
and most importantly colour are the signifi cant factors in determining the use of minerals for
precious and semiprecious stones. The mineral beryl produces emerald. Diamond, occurring
in kimberlite, is composed of carbon but its hardness, transparency, lustre, and rarity makes
it valuable. Amethyst is a violet-coloured variety of the abundantly occurring silica mineral
quartz whose colour makes it a semiprecious stone. The common precious and semiprecious
stones occurring in the rock formations of India are described in Section 24.9.4. Table 2.17

The previous sections provided an elaborate description of the various properties of minerals.
In fact, all common minerals under different mineral classes have been described by means of
tables (Tables 2.7 to 2.17) providing their composition, crystal forms, colour, streak, cleavage,
lustre, hardness, specifi c gravity, and other characteristics. Study of such minerals by naked eye
and laboratory tests are possible if the minerals are suffi ciently coarse. However, if they occur in
rocks or in very fi ne grains below the range of observation by hand lens of 10 × magnifi cation,

then microscopic observation is necessary. Detailed discussion of the optical method of mineral
identifi cation is beyond the scope of this book. There are many books on optical mineralogy for
study of non-opaque minerals such as Phillips W. R et al. (1979). This section provides a short
description of the optical method.
A petrological microscope is necessary for the study of optical properties of minerals.
In general, grains of less than 0.25 mm size are observed under microscope. They can be
observed by immersion in a liquid on a glass slide with a cover slip. In fact, to study the
minerals in a rock, the standard method is to prepare a thin slide of 0.03 mm thickness
with a cover slip and then study it under a microscope having different magnifying lenses.
The petrological microscope, called polarizing microscope, has a polarizer at the bottom
and an analyzer at the top. An isotropic substance (having same physical properties in
different directions) is found to be dark and remains so even after rotating the microscopic
stage. However, an anistropic mineral shows interference on rotation by 90° but distinctive
interference colour on the rotation of stage. Crystals belonging to other than cubic system are
optically anisotropic, and light is transmitted at differing velocities along different directions
within each crystal.
When a ray of light enters an anisotropic crystal, it is split into two rays, which travel in
different directions and are polarized in perpendicular planes. Such crystals are said to exhibit
double refraction or birefringences. The interference colour will depend upon the orientation.
To obtain an interference fi gure, the nicols (polarizers) are required to be crossed. Two types of
fi gures appear when the mineral is observed under crossed nicols. For a uniaxial substance the
fi gure is a black cross, and for a biaxial substance it is a biaxial bar. The angle between the optic
axes is known from the study of the curvature of the biaxial bar.
Each mineral has a fi xed refractive index. This can be determined by the optical microscope
and it helps to identify the mineral. One simple way is to place grains of the mineral under a
microscope and observe under low-power lens with transmitted light. The mineral grains are
placed on a microscopic slide immersed in a liquid of known refractive index. The liquid needs
to be changed until the grains are no more visible. This happens when the refractive index of the
mineral equals that of the liquid. From the refractive index of the liquid, the name of the mineral
can be identifi ed by referring to a standard chart of a mineralogy book.
Under the microscope, the distinctive characters that are to be observed for identifi cation of the
minerals include colour, cleavage, extinction angle, and birefringence of the grain. Birefringence
is the difference between the least and the greatest refractive indices of an isotropic mineral. The
higher the order of colour, the higher is the birefringence, which is often used in optical studies.
However, it is controlled by the thickness of the slide in grain mount as the interference colour
is dependent on the thickness of the grains through which light is transmitted.
X-ray diffraction method is another method of mineral identifi cation wherein a very minute
amount of material can be used to correctly detect the mineral. Small grains of gem and rare
minerals and noble metals are identifi ed by this method. Electron probe microanalyser is
nowadays used for mineralogical analysis. In its simplest form, scanning electron microscope
is used for the purpose. In addition, spectroscopy is also used for the identifi cation of
minerals.
2.10 GEOLOGICAL TIMESCALE AND UNCONFORMITIES BETWEEN ROCK FORMATIONS
Geology has recorded the age of rock formations worldwide and arranged them into columns of
its own timescale. This geological timescale is, in fact, the break-up of history of the earth into
Chapter_02.indd 44 10/26/2012 7:47:40 PM
Rocks and Minerals ● 45
hierarchical sets of divisions or units that contain eon, era, period, epoch, and age. Each of these
different spans of time in geological timescale indicates many tens of or hundreds of million years.
2.10.1 Relative and Absolute Timescales
Timescale includes both relative and absolute timescales. Relative timescale is based on the
relative age relationship expressed as vertical or stratigraphic positions and named on global
basis. The geological timescale subdivisions are essential for determining the relative age of the
strata. Absolute time is the numerical age (in million years) obtained from radiometric dating
of rocks. The geological age is usually presented by a vertical table to be read from the bottom
upwards, the oldest being in the bottom and the youngest at the top (Table 2.18).

In India rock formations of various ages can be found that extend over the entire geologic
timescale starting from Archaean to Holocene. The older rocks are generally stronger and the
oldest Archaean rocks (gneisses and granites), which have wide occurrence in India, are very
good for foundation purposes and also for use in other engineering constructions. The major rock
formations of India that fi nd frequent reference in this book have been included in Table 2.18
showing their age in both relative and absolute geological times. Detailed descriptions of these
rock formations are provided in Chapter 24.

2.10.2 Unconformity of Rock Formations and
Its Delimitation
The rock formations of an area are the specifi c
rock units delimited from major geological
evidences including tectonic and paleontological
events. All these events make a mark on the rock
formations. The earth’s crust has been constantly
changing during the geological time due to tectonic
movements or structural disturbances such as
upheaval, tilting, folding, and faulting. Igneous
activity and metamorphism are also responsible for
the changing patterns in rock formations. An abrupt
change in the depositional regime of sedimentary
rocks is marked by unconformity (Fig. 2.20),
which is the main basis for differentiating two
rock formations. It may be of three types, namely
disconformity, non-conformity, and angular
unconformity.
Between two rock formations, if the older and
Fig. 2.20 Unconformity (angular unconformity) younger beds have structurally parallel disposition
but the overlying bed has been formed after a long geological time compared to the underlying
bed, it is termed as disconfi rmity. In other words, disconformity is an unconformity between
parallel layers of sedimentary rocks representing a period of erosion or non-deposition
(Fig. 2.21). The term non-conformity is used when a deep-seated igneous rock body is overlain
by sedimentary rocks or lava fl ow (Fig. 2.22). In another type of unconformity known as
angular unconformity, horizontally layered sedimentary beds are deposited overlain by tilted
and eroded layers of sedimentary beds exhibiting discordant relationship (Figs 2.23 and 2.20).
Fig. 2.21 Disconformity between parallel layers Fig. 2.22 Non-conformity between sedimentary
by erosion bed and igneous rocks
In a sequence of conformable sedimentary beds, if the younger bed appears to be occurring
beyond the limits of the older underlying bed, it is called overlap (Fig. 2.24). Such feature is
found in the fringe of continental shelves caused during marine transgression. Palaeontology
(study of fossils) provides major criteria for geologic divisions of rock formations on the basis
of specifi c life forms during the geologic past. The life forms that started or became extinct
during different geological times have been shown in column 1 of Table 2.18.

2.11 FIELD IDENTIFICATION OF COMMON ROCKS WITH SIMPLE ACCESSORIES
The megascopic characters of rocks help to a great extent in identifying common rocks. A hand
lens (× 10) is necessary to examine the mineral features and textures of rocks. A grain-size chart
is to be used to measure (by comparison) the size of clastic particles of sedimentary rocks. This
chart can be prepared by fi xing particles of measured size on a small board by means of glue.
Dilute hydrochloric acid is used to test limestone that effervesces with the acid. The following
subsections provide the key features to be observed in hand specimens of igneous rocks,
sedimentary rocks, and metamorphic rocks for their identifi cation, following Wahlstrom (1974).

The following features can be used to identify sedimentary rocks:
1. Clastic sedimentary rocks comprise mainly quartz and feldspar with clay and/or silica matrix.
The size of a sand or gravel particle can be measured by comparison with the particle size chart.

• Calcarenite—entirely of sand-size calcite particles
3. Pyroclastic rocks formed by deposition of rock fragments and ash derived from volcanic
eruption
• Volcanic breccia and volcanic agglomerate—uneven rock fragments
• Tuff—mostly volcanic ash (particle size < 4 mm)
4. Further divisions in nomenclature of sedimentary rocks such as sandy shale, calcareous
sandstone, clayey sandstone, and limestone breccia can be made depending upon the
constituents and the cementing materials.
2.11.3 Metamorphic Rocks
The following features can be used to identify metamorphic rocks:
1. Foliated rocks containing abundant quartz and/or feldspar and other minerals to different
extent and showing foliation or linear arrangement of minerals.
• Gneiss—foliated rocks due to platy or parallel arrangements of minerals including micas
(depending on the content of platy minerals, gneiss is subdivided as granite gneiss, mica
gneiss, hornblende gneiss, etc.)
• Schist—micaceous or platy minerals in subparallel arrangements (schistosity) (depending
upon the major constituent mineral, schists may be muscovite schist, biotite schist,
hornblende schist, etc.)
2. Rocks containing mostly fi ne-grained platy and micaceous minerals with tendency to split
easily.

examination
• Slate—individual grains not easily visible, rock splits easily in thin plates along the cleavage

3.1 INTRODUCTION
Under applied stress, rocks are deformed and give rise to different types of structures
that have an important bearing on engineering constructions. This chapter mainly
deals with the principal rock structures formed under deformation mechanism
including folds, faults, and joints. It describes with illustrations all the major types
of folds occurring in the earth’s crust. The chapter also illustrates the characteristic
features of different types of faults, their effects on underground structures such as
tunnels, and the methods of identifying the faults. It traces the origin of different
types of joints and analyses their parameters in relation to design of support system
for preventing wall collapses and overbreaks of underground structures. The chapter
further highlights the infl uence of folds, faults, and joints, especially their harmful
effects, in the construction of engineering structures.
3.2 MECHANISM OF DEFORMATION OF ROCKS
A rock body is deformed when it is subjected to external forces. The factors respon-
sible for deformation of rocks include pressure, temperature, rock composition,
presence or absence of fl uids, and type of stress and its rate of application. The most
important among these factors are the type of stress, rate of stress, and temperature.
3.2.1 Effect of Stress and Strain—Brittle and Ductile Rocks
Stress is the force applied on the surface of a body and strain is the resultant effect
that causes a change in the shape, size, or volume of that body. In other words, strain
is the measure of material deformation such as the amount of compression when
Chapter_03.indd 51 10/27/2012 12:47:17 PM
52 ● Engineering Geology
something is squeezed or elongation when it is stretched. A change in the volume of a body is
termed as dilation, whereas an alteration of shape is known as distortion. Depending upon the
resistance offered by a rock body, stresses are classifi ed into three types—compressive, shear,
and tensile. Compressive stress tends to compress the rock body resulting in a decrease in
volume and shear stress tends to shear (i.e., break apart) one part from the other. Tensile stress
tends to develop cracks in the body of the rock samples. Stress is measured as the total force per
unit area and expressed as kg/cm2 or tonne/m2 in the metric system.
A material is said to be brittle if it deforms under stress by development of fractures. A
rock body behaves typically brittle at low temperature and pressure. A ductile material
deforms without breaking or cracking, except when it deforms too much and too quickly.
A rock body behaves typically ductile at high temperature and pressure. A typical stress–
strain curve of a brittle material will be linear and that of a ductile material non-linear
as shown in Fig. 3.1(a).

3.2.2 Elastic and Plastic Deformation
Deformation of a rock is related to its elastic properties. A rock subjected to stress gets
deformed, but on removal of the stress, it may return to its original form partially or wholly.
This property of a rock is known as its elasticity. Under elastic deformation, a rock kept under
load will restore to its original shape after it is relieved of the load. If it cannot restore to its
original shape even after the removal of stress, the state of deformation of the rock is known as
plastic deformation. Depending on the extent of applied stress, the shape of a rock under plastic
deformation may be partially altered; however, with excessive stress or depending on the rock
type, there may be permanent deformation of rock.
Under plastic deformation, a body may develop rupture when its cohesion is completely
destroyed. When a rupture occurs, the discrete portions of the body are separated from the
fractured surface. The stress difference required to develop the fractures is known as the
ultimate strength of the material. Some substances such as clay may suffer from strain, but
Chapter_03.indd 52 10/27/2012 12:47:18 PM
Rock Structures and Their Engineering Signifi cance ● 53
without destroying their cohesion. However, under compression, the water content of the clay
is squeezed out and when it dries, it loses its plasticity. Thus, the deformation of a rock depends
upon its physical properties and the stress difference under specifi c pressure–temperature
conditions (Section 10.5).
Cataclasis is the deformation of rocks by the mechanical process of shearing and granulation.
Such cataclastic rocks are said to have undergone dislocation metamorphism and range from
coarsely broken breccia to intensely deformed mylonite. Cataclasite is a fault rock that consists
of angular clasts in a fi ne-grained matrix. Cataclastic fl ow is the main deformation mechanism
accommodating large strains above the brittle–ductile transition zone. It can be regarded as a
ductile mechanism, although it takes place within the elastico-frictional regime of deformation.
The deformation is accommodated by the sliding and rolling of fragments within the cataclastic
rocks (Fig. 3.2).

3.3 FOLDS AND CAUSES OF THEIR FORMATION
The strata forming the earth’s crust, when subjected to both horizontal and vertical forces, are
bent or buckled. The structure thus developed is called fl exure or fold. In most cases, folding
involves the operation of forces tangential to
the earth’s surface. They are generally formed

A single bed or multiple beds of stratifi ed rocks.
However, when a horizontal bed is subjected
to force in one end like a beam loaded at the
end, it will bend with a simple fl exure at a very
low angle forming a monocline. The cross

54 ● Engineering Geology
There are many causes for the formation of folds, which appear in all rocks and in varied
scales. Folds are formed when one or a stalk of originally fl at and planar surfaces, such as
sedimentary strata are bent or curved as a result of permanent deformation. Folds in rocks
vary in size from microscopic crinkles to mountain-size folds. They occur singly as isolated
folds or as extensive ranges of different sizes on a variety of scales. They may be formed under
various conditions of stress, hydrostatic pressure, pore pressure, and temperature as evident by
their presence in soft sediments, the full spectrum of metamorphic rocks, and even as primary
fl ow structures in some igneous rocks. Figure 3.4 shows the initial stage of fold formation by
bending of sedimentary strata in the Aravalli formation in Rajasthan.
Fig. 3.4 Initial stage of fold formation in Fig. 3.5 Buckled fold in competent
Aravalli formation in Rajasthan layers with incompetent matrix
Folds are commonly formed by shortening of existing layers, but may also be formed as a
result of displacement on a non-planar fault or at the tip of a propagating fault by differential
compaction or due to the effects of a high-level igneous intrusion. When a sequence of layered
rocks is shortened parallel to its layering, deformation may be accommodated by a number
of ways such as homogeneous shortening, reverse faulting, or folding. The response depends
on the thickness of the mechanical layering
and the contrast in properties between the
layers. If the layering tends to make a folding,
the nature of folds will also be guided by these
properties. Isolated thick competent layers in a
less-competent matrix control the folding and
typically generate classic rounded buckle folds
accommodated by deformation in the matrix
(Fig. 3.5). In the case of regular alterations
of layers of contrasting properties, such as
sandstone–shale sequence, kink-bands, box-
Fig. 3.6 Chevron fold in thin sandy and clayey layers folds, and chevron folds (Fig. 3.6) are produced.

3.3.1 Anatomy of Folds
The different parts of a fold are termed differently. The highest point of an anticline is termed
crest, see Fig. 3.7(a). When an anticline type of fold shows nearly equal dips in all sides
with respect to its crest, it is known as a dome. The inclined parts of the strata where the
anticline and syncline merge are called the limbs of the fold. The axial plane is the imaginary
divisional plane separating the fold into two nearly equal parts. The axis or axial line is
defi ned as the intersection of the axial plane of a fold with the ground surface. The plunge
(also called pitch) of a fold is the angle made by the axial line with the horizontal in the axial
plane, see Fig. 3.7(b).

3.3.2 Anticline and Syncline—Symmetry and Other Features
An anticline is the upward convex fl exure of a bed, whereas a syncline is the downward
convex fl exure. In an anticline, younger beds will be in the convex side and older beds in
the core, whereas in a syncline, younger beds
will be in the concave side and older beds in the
core. Due to tension at the top of an anticline,
joints or cracks are developed, which are termed
as tension joints (Fig. 3.3). Similarly, the bottom
part of a syncline is also likely to develop
fractures due to tensional force. Figure 3.8 shows
the limbs and fold axes for anticline and syncline
of an asymmetrical anticline and syncline.
In the fi gure, the pencil tip is on the crest of
the anticline and its other end points to the
syncline.
If the two limbs of an anticline and a syncline
have equal slopes, they are termed symmetric

vertical, whereas in an asymmetric fold it is inclined (Fig. 3.10). The term antiform is used
for any fold that is convex upward for which the relationship between the fold and the various
strata is unknown. An anticline of regional scale consisting of a series of smaller anticlines and
synclines is called anticlinorium. A vast syncline of regional scale with its strata further folded
into subordinate synclines and anticlines is termed as synclinorium.

3.3.3 Principal Types of Folds and Their Field Characters
Several types of folds occur in the rocks of the earth’s surface. The principal types of
folds (Billings 1997) commonly seen in different kinds of rocks are briefl y illustrated as
follows:
Plunging fold A fold may not continue for an indefi nite distance, but dies away after a certain
length. If a fold is traced along its axial line direction, it may be found that the amplitude of an
anticline decreases until it merges with the unfolded beds, when it is called plunging anticline,
see Fig. 3.7(a). In case of a plunging syncline the trough becomes shallower along its axis in
one direction, as shown in Fig. 3.7(b).
Isoclinal fold In this type, both the limbs of a fold dip in the same direction and are equally
inclined, as shown in Fig. 3.11(a). If the axial plane is vertical, the fold is termed vertical
isoclinal fold; if it is inclined, it is called overturned isoclinal fold.
Recumbent fold Here, the axial plane of a fold is horizontal or makes a very low angle with
the horizontal, as shown in Fig. 3.11(b).
Chevron fold This type of fold, also called the zig-zag fold, has straight or planar limbs
and angular hinges. The bedding planes of the fold are parallel to the limbs, as shown in
Figs 3.11(c) and 3.6.
Monocline It is a simple type of fl exure formed by bending of a horizontal or very
low-dipping bed with anticlinal bend at the top and synclinal bed at the bottom, as shown in
Fig. 3.11(d).
Drag fold It is formed when a competent bed such as sandstone slides past an incompetent
bed such as shale. The drag folds are related to fault movement. The relative direction of
movement of the fault can be traced from the trend and inclination of the axial planes of the
drag fold as shown in Fig. 3.11(e).

Ptygmatic fold This type of fold is formed in
weak beds yielding easily to deformation and
assuming any shape impressed upon them by
the surrounding rigid rocks. Ptygmatic fold may
result from viscous fl ow of incompetent rocks
under small stress difference and hence is also
known as fl ow fold. Quartzo-feldspathic veins
and pegmatites are commonly convoluted and
buckled as ptygmatic folds during high-grade
metamorphism see Fig. 3.12.
3.4 CAUSES AND MECHANISM OF FAULTS
A rock mass cannot separate into two parts and
Fig. 3.12 Ptygmatic fold in quartzo-felspathic veins
glide or fl ow past one other because of its rigidity
and friction. This results in a build up of stress, which leads to the accumulation of potential
energy, up to a level exceeding the strain threshold. Once the threshold energy is gained, the
necessary relative motion is set in along a weak plane in the rock to cause fault movement. The
relative motion of rocks on either side of a fault surface controls the origin and mechanism of
the small faults as well as the tectonic fault related to plate movement.
Chapter_03.indd 57 10/27/2012 12:47:19 PM
58 ● Engineering Geology
A fault is basically a shear failure. Since both compressive and tensile stresses act simultaneously,
a fault may be caused by pressure or tension. A normal fault is produced by vertical pressure and a
reverse fault is the result of horizontal thrust. A gravity fault may be produced at a place by release
of vertical pressure when the magma fl ows out from a part of the earth’s crust. Tension in deeper
strata may act in the same way by the removal of vertical support. A fault may occur because of
various types of tensile strengths in the rocks of upper strata of the earth.
Depending on the nature of the rock, strain is both accumulative and instantaneous. The
ductile lower crust and mantle accumulates deformation gradually via shearing, whereas the
brittle upper crust reacts by fracture, or instantaneous stress release, to cause motion along
the fault. A fault in ductile rocks can also release instantaneously when the strain rate is
too high.
A fault plane or failure surface is analogous to the surface obtained by testing for compression
strength in a test specimen (see Section 10.4.4). The angle made by the test is acute (< 45°) in
case of brittle material, whereas in plastic and ductile rocks, it is obtuse (> 45°). This analogy
if applied in practice implies that a fault occurs when the rock is plastic and becomes brittle
afterwards. This may be true in the case of an igneous rock undergoing its fi nal stages of
cooling after magmatic origin. In the case of a sedimentary rock too, this may be the case
when it contains little cementing materials; however, later, when it is combined with siliceous,
carbonate or iron oxide, it gains strength to act as a brittle rock (Krynine and Judd 1957).
3.4.1 Basic Terms Related to Faults
Fault is the displacement of a rock mass along a weak plane (called fault plane) marked F–F
in Figs 3.13(a) and (b). The arrow in the fi gure indicates the relative movement of the blocks
of the two sides. In a normal fault, the displacement is downwards in the same direction as the
inclination of the fault plane. The surface of rock beneath a fault plane is the footwall and that

above the fault plane is the hanging wall. In a reverse fault, the movement along the inclined
fault plane is up-dip. The term slip denotes the relative displacement between two blocks; the
vertical component of a slip is known as throw and its horizontal component as heave.
In reality, a fault plane is rarely a clean-cut plane or surface, but it is mostly a zone of
complex deformation containing shattered rocks. This zone, also called the fault zone, varies in
width from a few centimetres to several hundreds
of metres. A shear zone, also called the crush
zone, can also be very narrow to very large (few
centimetres to even few kilometres) in width and
it consists of many parallel fractures and crushed
rocks formed by shearing of rock mass.
Shearing may also create zones with rock
fragments of lenticular shape resembling elongated
pebbles. Figure 3.14 illustrates sheared sandstone
showing a lenticular body and cavity formation
with erosion of crushed material. Intensive
crushing of rock in the fault zone produces clayey
material called gouge. There are two types of
movements along a fault, namely rotational and
translational. In rotational movement, there
is rotation of one displaced block with respect
to another. In translational movement, the two
Fig. 3.14 Sheared sandstone showing lenticular blocks remain parallel with respect to one another
body and cavity formation even after displacement.
3.4.2 Illustrative Description of Different Types of Faults
The following is a description of the different types of faults depending on the nature of
displacement:
Normal fault
Normal fault is the simplest type of fault in which the hanging wall block moves downwards,
relative to the footwall block, see Fig. 3.15(a). Tectonic movement of the earth’s crust may give
rise to normal faults. The tensional stress is responsible for the displacement of crustal blocks
in a normal fault.
Reverse fault or thrust
In reverse fault or thrust, the movement of the crystal block is such that the hanging wall moves
upwards relative to the footwall, see Fig. 3.15(c). This fault brings about salient changes in the
rock mass. If the fault plane slopes at an angle of more than 45°, it is up-thrust. If it is less than
45°, it is over-thrust. In the over-thrust, the hanging wall actually moves over the footwall. It is
the reverse in the case of under-thrust when the footwall is pushed under the hanging wall. A very
low angle (nearly horizontal) thrust is called nappe.
Strike-slip fault
In strike-slip fault, shown in Fig. 3.15(b), the movement is essentially horizontal under
the action of shearing stresses. This type of fault is associated with folding and tearing.
Figure 3.15(c) shows a strike-slip reverse fault where the movement is both in the strike

the fault plane, the strike and dip of the affected
blocks, and the surface confi guration. In the upper parts of the earth’s crust (top 10 km), faulting
results from brittle fracture and displacement of rock blocks. Shearing, crushing, brecciation,
gouge, and cataclastic rocks (fragmented pre-existing rocks) are the characteristic features of
brittle deformation. The process of brittle deformation is also evident from the presence of a
glassy and cryptocrystalline material called pseudotachylite, which looks like a volcanic rock.
This is produced as a result of melting by heat generated from frictional slide along the fault
plane of brittle rocks such as gabbro, amphibolite, or gneiss.
At deeper parts of the crust (below 10 km), faulting is caused by ductile deformation as
evident from the presence of mylonite. Large relict grains called porphyroclasts are found as
asymmetrical tails in mylonites. A partially mylonitized rock called protomylonite may also be
produced in the shear zone by ductile deformation. Linear structures such as rotated boudins
and drag folds originated from deformation in ductile shear zones provide evidence of the
relative displacement along the fault plane between the plutons and country rocks.
3.4.4 Clues for Field Identifi cation of Faults
Some clues for fi eld identifi cation of faults are listed as follows:
• A valley running straight for a long distance is indicative of a fault. The straight feature of
the valley may be clearly visible in aerial photographs.
• Juxtaposition of younger beds with older strata is an evidence of the presence of a fault.
• Offsets of sedimentary beds suggest the presence of a fault between the offset beds.
• Offsets of quartz stringers or pegmatite veins in igneous rocks indicate the presence of a fault.
The presence of a fault can be understood from features such as feather joints (tension joints),
which also help to identify whether it is a normal or reverse fault. The acute angle between the
fault plane and the feather joints indicates the direction of actual movement of the blocks.
The polished surfaces of faults are termed slickensides (Fig. 3.16), which may also form
on joint surface. They contain small parallel groves or striations that resulted from friction.
Chapter_03.indd 60 10/27/2012 12:47:19 PM
Rock Structures and Their Engineering Signifi cance ● 61
Slickensides are indicative of faults. The fault
surface is also smooth and striated, having a
step-like feature. Moving the fi ngers along the
slickenside surface produces a smooth feeling
along the slip direction and a harsh feeling in the
reverse direction.
3.5 CAUSES OF JOINTING AND GENETIC
TYPES OF JOINTS IN ROCKS
Since rock structures result from stresses, it can
be said that a rock will eventually fracture if it is
under stress. Joints are fractures with regularity
and continuity with respect to each other or to
Fig. 3.16 Slickenside on a fault plane indicating the
the other elements of the rock masses. Typically,
direction of fault from left to right
there is little or no lateral movement across
joints. They normally have a regular shape related to either the mechanical properties of the
individual rock or to the thickness of the layers involved. Joints occur as sets, with each set
having sub-parallel arrangement of joints to each other.
Joints form in solid and hard rock that is stretched such that its brittle strength is exceeded
(the point at which it breaks). When this happens, the rock fractures in a plane parallel to
the maximum principal stress and perpendicular to the minimum principal stress (the
direction at which the rock is being stretched). This leads to the development of a sub-parallel
joint set. Continued deformation may lead to development of one or more additional joint
sets. The presence of the fi rst set strongly hampers the stress orientation in the rock layer,
often causing subsequent sets to form at a high angle to the fi rst set. The joint sets are
commonly observed to have relatively constant spacing that is roughly proportional to the
thickness of the layer. Depending upon their genesis, joints are broadly classifi ed into the
following types:
Tectonic joints These are formed during deformation episodes of rock formation when
the differential stress is high enough to induce tensile failure in rock body, irrespective of the
tectonic regime (Fig. 3.3).
Unloading joints These are formed when erosion removes the overlying rocks, thereby
reducing the compressive load and allowing the rock to expand laterally (see Section 3.5.2).
Exfoliation joints These are in fact special cases of unloading joints formed parallel to the
present land surface in rocks of high compressive strength.
Cooling joints These are formed by the cooling of the hot rock masses, particularly lava, and
are commonly expressed as vertical columnar joints (see Section 3.5.2).
3.5.1 Orientation, Spacing, Roughness, and Other Features of Joints
Joints are planes of discontinuities in the rock mass along which very little or no displacement
has taken place. They are to be distinguished from fractures, which are defi ned as planar surfaces
along which the rock has no cohesion. Fractures may be irregular in their trend but joints have
fi xed orientation and attitudes such as strike and dip. Joints extend over a considerable part of
a rock body generally showing more than one pattern or a set of joints.
Chapter_03.indd 61 10/27/2012 12:47:19 PM
62 ● Engineering Geology
The important features of joints are as follows:
• A group of parallel joints is called a set and several joint sets intersect to form a joint system.
• If the angle of intersection between the two sets is 90°, they are said to be conjugate sets.
The joints are generally open and the openings at the surface are from a few millimetres to
several centimetres. The openings of joints decrease and fi nally pinch out at the depths.
• Joints may be fi lled with different materials. In general, the fi llings are clayey or crushed
materials or the opening may be sealed by secondary silicifi cation with quartz veins.
• Joints are frequently found to follow bedding and foliation planes or cleavage and accord-
ingly called bedding joints, foliation joints, and cleavage joints.
Orientation
Attitudes such as direction and amount of dip and strike of joints provide the orientations of
joints. It is expressed as E–W 40°(cid:2)S, meaning the strike of joint is east–west and it dips at
an angle of 40° directed south (Fig. 3.17). The orientation of joints is measured instrumentally
from the rock outcrops in the fi eld and
plotted on a geological map by symbols.
In fi xing the alignments of engineering
structures such as tunnels, underground
chambers, and dams, the orientation of
joints in the rocks of these sites requires
careful study.
Spacing
Spacing is the perpendicular distance
between two adjacent joints. The spacing
between two joints may vary from a
few centimetres to more than a metre,
depending on the rock type. Under
the same stress, competent rocks will
Fig. 3.17 Joints in quartzite depicting a bedding joint
or dip joint with strike E–W dip 40° South have more joints and smaller spacing
than less-competent rocks. There is a
relationship between joint spacing and bed thickness. Joint sets are commonly observed to have
relatively constant spacing roughly proportional to the thickness of the bed.
Roughness
Roughness is the waviness or miniature stepping of the joint surface. A joint surface may
possess a series of small steps showing that the surface is rather rough unless there is a slip
along the surface. Any displacement along the joint surface during or after its origin makes it
smooth and develops slickenside (Fig. 3.16). The presence of minute steps or waviness, called
striations, provides evidence that a displacement or slip has taken place along the joint surface.
Quantitative evaluation of this parameter is done in rock quality classifi cation (see Section 10.9
and Table 10.6).
Frequency
The number of joints per metre is estimated as the frequency of the joints. The measurement is
done from rock outcrops in the fi eld and also from cores of drill holes. The measured frequency
Chapter_03.indd 62 10/27/2012 12:47:20 PM
Rock Structures and Their Engineering Signifi cance ● 63
of joints from drill cores when correlated with water percolation test data provides information
on the seepage or leakage problem of dam projects.
Aperture
Aperture is the perpendicular distance between the joint walls. In other words, it is the width of
the joint opening. Apertures of many joints are wide open to allow large fl ow of water through
them but some are tight and may cause seepage of water. Some fi ne joints are watertight but
may not be airtight. Before selecting a site for underground rock chambers for gas storage, it is
essential to thoroughly study the apertures with respect to their tightness to water and air.
Number of sets T
The number of joint sets is counted from the intersecting joint system. Vertically intersected two
conjugate joint sets with horizontal or near joints create regular cubic blocks, the dimensions
of which depend upon the spacing of the joints. Such blocks when formed by open joints are
vulnerable to rock slides. In Fig. 3.18, there are three distinct sets of joints—vertical, horizontal,
and inclined. In Fig. 3.19, there are two sets, that is, one inclined and one steeply inclined.

64 ● Engineering Geology
Filling and coating
The fi ll materials in a joint vary widely. Many joints that originated with considerable openings
are tightly fi lled with veins or dyke minerals. Secondary silica or hydrothermal quartz completely
seals the joint openings. Filling by loose materials such as clay, silt, and micas is found in joints
close to surface rocks, but with increasing depths there is a decrease in loose fi llings.
3.5.2 Types of Joints in Different Rock Types and Their Origin
The origin of joints is associated with the formation of rock types and later tectonic movements.
The joints associated with tectonic movement are very prolifi c in all the rock groups, namely
igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic rocks. The failure of a brittle body under compression
takes place by shearing along two directions of least strain, which are nearly at right angles or at
acute angles to each other. These are the shear joints. In ductile substances, the angle between
the shear planes is obtuse. In addition to shearing forces, tensional forces (i.e., pull) also create
joints, which are known as tension joints. An anticline develops innumerable tension joints
arranged in its upper surface (see Fig. 3.3).
Joints in sedimentary rocks
Sedimentary rocks may undergo varying degrees of dislocation consisting of fi ssuring transverse
to beds. The most common types of joints in sedimentary rocks are the bedding joints formed
parallel to the bedding plane. In a dipping stratum, joints may be developed along the strike as
well as dip directions of the bed and are known
as strike and dip joints, respectively. In Fig. 3.17,
the bedding joint and the dip joint are the same.
Joints may be formed intersecting the bedding
planes or layered surfaces at a very steep angle.
In general, two sets of such steep-dipping to
near-vertical joints occur in bedded or foliated
rocks trending at right angles to each other, as
may be seen in Fig. 3.17. The two vertical sets
of joints in conjunction with the dipping bedding
Fig. 3.20 Block joints in sandstone formed by joints give rise to block joints (Fig. 3.20).

three types of joints, namely cross joints,

(Fig. 3.21). Cross joints are aligned perpendicular
to linear structures similar to the primary fl ow
lines corresponding to the long axes of crystals.
These joints are developed due to tension, and
when present in rocks free from primary fl ow,
they are called tension joints. The joint spaces
Fig. 3.21 Three types of joints commonly seen in
intrusive igneous rock are commonly fi lled with hydrothermal quartz or

Rock Structures and Their Engineering Signifi cance ● 65
veins of pegmatite and aplite. In contrast to cross joints, longitudinal joints are formed trending
parallel to the fl ow lines following regional structural trend. These are best developed near the
roof of large intrusive bodies such as dykes of basalt, pegmatite, and aplite. Flat-lying joints are
formed mostly during early fl ow of magma occurring oblique to the fl ow lines. Dykes and veins
generally occupy the fl at-lying joints of primary fl ow origin. In addition to these three joints,
diagonal joints are formed transverse (nearly 45°) to the fl ow lineation of the plutons. The open
spaces of these joints are fi lled by hydrothermal minerals such as chlorite, epidote, and fl uorite or
occupied by veins and dykes of aplite and pegmatite.
Columnar joints In homogeneous and extru-
sive types of igneous rocks, the force of contrac-
tion during cooling of lava gives rise to columnar
joints (Fig. 3.22). This type of joints generally
show hexagonal pattern but may be of rectangu-
lar, pentagonal, or other polygonal shape in cross
section. The columnar joints are abundantly
present in volcanic rocks such as basalt in the
Deccan traps of India. Some dykes formed by
solidifi cation of near-surface magma also exhibit
columnar joints. In a lava fl ow, these joints are
developed perpendicular to the cooling surfaces.
Both compression and tension act together to
Fig. 3.22 Columnar joints of Deccan give rise to columnar joints.
Extension joints or sheets These joints
result from the unloading of rocks by erosion of
landmass. With the removal of super incumbent
load, the rock expands vertically giving rise to
these joints, which have a rather close spacing
created by segmentation of the rock body with
sheet-like appearance. The process is known
as sheeting. The spacing of these joints varies
between 10 cm and two metres closer to surface,
but becomes wider with increasing depths. Sheet
joints are mainly prevalent in granites but may
also occur in quartzite and sandstone (Fig. 3.23).

arranged in a radial pattern are formed in lava
fl ows around a volcanic crater. Due to withdrawal of magma from its chambers underlying the
crater, the rock surface of crust close to the volcano’s vent gets fragmented creating radial joints
and also fractures of cylindrical pattern called ring fractures.
3.5.3 Diagrammatic Representation of Joints
It is common practice to present the joints measured in the site of an engineering structure by
a diagram. A simple way to show the intensity of joints and their attitudes is by a histogram.
Histograms indicate the percentage of the joints dipping at different angles. Nearly 200 joints
are measured with respect to their dip direction and amount. The dips are grouped into 10°
Chapter_03.indd 65 10/27/2012 12:47:20 PM
66 ● Engineering Geology
or 15° intervals. Thus, there may be six divisions, 0–15°, 15–30°, 30–45°, 45–60°, 60–75°,
and 75–90°. The percentages of joints measured in the fi eld that fall within these six divisions
are then plotted in a histogram to show the direction and intensity (percentage) of joints.
Figure 3.24 is a histogram of 200 joints in hard rocks showing their dips in relation to
concentration (by percentage) in different directions.

The joints measured in the fi eld can also be
illustrated in a rose diagram, which shows the
intensity (as percentage) of joints measured in
the fi eld grouped under 15° divisions and the
directions covering the entire 360°. The amount
of dip of the most-intensive joints is written by
the side. Figure 3.25 is a rose diagram of over 200
joints in rocks showing maximum concentration
(by percentage) in the southwest and northwest
parts with steep dips. It is, however, preferable
to plot the joint attitudes (joint poles) on an
equal-area net and present the data by contour
diagram. From this diagram, the parameters of
divisional planes (joints) in rock with maximum
concentration can be easily detected and used
in engineering geological analyses of site
conditions for founding engineering structures.

3.6 PRIMARY STRUCTURES OF SEDIMENTARY ROCKS AND THEIR SIGNIFICANCE
The structures of sedimentary rocks are visible mostly in the outcrops of the rocks and scarcely
in hand specimens. These features formed by sediments of both inorganic and organic matters are
characteristic of varied depositional environment as stated by Pettijohn (1957). Figure 3.27 illustrates
the various sedimentary structures. This is followed by brief descriptions of the different sedimentary
structures analysing the geological merits and demerits of their presence in a project site.

Bedding The most prominent structural feature in sedimentary rocks is the bedding defi ned by
texture and composition of the mineral grains (Fig. 3.28). A bed is formed by uniform deposition of
sediments under nearly constant physical conditions. Thickness, composition, fabric, and orientation
of the beds are important parameters of study in a sedimentary bed if present in an engineering site.
Mud cracks These are shrinkage cracks found in fi ne-grain sedimentary beds consisting of
siltstone and shale. The pattern of the cracks may appear nearly rectangular, pentagonal, or
hexagonal in geometric shape, but are mostly irregular in their surface features (Fig. 3.29).
When clay or silt is exposed to sun in an intertidal zone, these physical cracks are created by
desiccation during low-tide period. With the incoming tide, the mud cracks remain buried and
preserved. Erosion of the upper layers in this stratifi ed intertidal deposit brings the mud cracks
to the surface. As a result of drying by the sun, they tend to curl concave upwards and may

Lamination A minor change in the depositional condition during the formation of
bedding may cause thin layering of silty or clayey matter, which is a distinctive feature between
two thick beds. Such a layered feature is called lamination, see Fig. 3.27(a). These minor layers
referred to as lamina vary in thickness from a few millimetres to one or two centimetres.
Graded bedding It is formed when particles are deposited in a gradual variation in the vertical
direction from coarser at the bottom to fi ner towards the upper parts, see Fig. 3.27(b). This
kind of deposition takes place under slow movement of current causing good sorting of grains.
Graded bedding is a good indicator of top and bottom beds in isoclinals or overturned folds.
Cross beddings These are commonly present in medium- to coarse-grained sedimentary
beds. Cross beddings (also called current beddings) are characteristic features of deposition
of sandy aparticles in rivers, deltas, and dunes
formed from downstream migration of current
ripples and waves. Extension fractures are
prevalent in cross-bedded strata. These structural
features are indicators of stream fl ow direction
in river deposits and wind direction in dune
sands, see Figs 3.27(c) and 3.30. Cross bedding
is also useful in determining the top and bottom
of overturned beds in recumbent folds.
Ripple marks These features are found in
sedimentary beds consisting of fi ne-grain sands
and silts. The two common types of ripple marks
are asymmetrical and symmetrical in profi les.
The former type is formed by stream current and
Fig. 3.30 Cross bedding (or current bedding)
the latter by oscillation of waves. When a current
fl ows over a bed under slow velocity, the sand moves forming ripples on the surface of sands.
These features are also caused by wind action in dune sands. The ripple marks are characterized
by alternative small troughs and ridges oriented at right angles to the direction of water or
wind movement, see Fig. 3.27(d). As such, the features when preserved in rocks can be used to
determine the direction of paleocurrent.
Sole marks, scour casts, fl ute casts, and groove casts Sole marks are trough-like surfaces
with stand-up borders formed by the action of current on clay beds by unequal loading or by the
action of organisms. These are commonly found in claystone or shale underlain by sandstone
and created by turbidity current. When a clay bed is scoured by erosion having a pot-like
surface, the surface may be later fi lled by sandy material to form scour cast structures. Flute
casts are the narrow ends of scour casts, see Fig. 3.27(e). Groove casts are formed by fi lling of
grooves by sand in shale. All these structural features are used in deciding the top and bottom
beds in intensely folded strata.
Stylolite This structure appears as a suture or ‘tracing of a style’ and commonly occurs in
sandstone, limestone, and marble, see Fig. 3.27(f). The sutures range from a fraction of a
millimetre to a maximum of a centimetre in thickness. The relief of the stylolite surface has
teeth-like projections produced by chemical solution under certain pressure conditions.
Stromatolite This is a sedimentary structure of organic origin. Such a structure occurs only
in limestone, see Fig. 3.27(g). It is formed from the assemblage of blue-green algae by means
of precipitation but not as a product of fossils of other organisms.

3.7 POTENTIAL PROBLEMS FROM ROCK STRUCTURES IN ENGINEERING
CONSTRUCTIONS
Study of the behaviour of the geological structures originated from deformation of rocks (such
as fold, fault, shear zones, joints, and fractures) is very important in engineering geology. All
these structures affect the strength and rigidity of rocks. The presence of fault, shear zone, and
extensive joints in rocks weakens the foundation and poses problems in surface and subsurface
engineering constructions. Before undertaking a project, it is therefore necessary to identify
these geological structures and assess the problems that may be created due to their presence
in various construction sites such as dams, tunnels, powerhouses, and underground chambers.
The potential problems from rock structures are then to be reported to the engineers to facilitate
the estimation of cost of treatment in the planning and design. Wherever possible, a site with
highly adverse geological structures requiring very high cost of treatment should be avoided
and a better site should be chosen. The problems that may arise due to the different types of
geological structures in engineering constructions and in structures such as dams and tunnels
are discussed here.
3.7.1 Problems of Folds
Folds are obvious features when visible in surface exposures of rock. However, in many sites,
the folded features are obliterated due to land erosion. The presence of folds and their details
can be easily detected from aerial photo study. Repetition of beds in ground surface is a criterion
of identifi cation of a fold structure. Plotting of rock attitudes such as strike and dip of beds in
a geological map and preparation of a geological section helps in the determination of the
types of folds. Closure of a fold is also known when attitudes are plotted in a geological map
extending over a considerable area.
An anticlinal fold is commonly segmented by intensive joints and in some places associated
with a fault. As such, the presence of a fold in a dam site may create foundation problems
including leakage and requires thorough treatment adding to project cost. Infi ltration of
water along the joints further deteriorates the rock condition by weathering and erosion.
When such a harmful feature occurs in a slope cut along a road, it may create problems
of instability and rock slide. The synclinal fold also plays an important role in storing and
migration of water through the planes of discontinuities. When present in the foundation or
reservoir periphery, synclinal folds may create problems of seepage or extensive leakage.
When drilling or excavation punctures water-

condition, it leads to the problem of sudden
rush of trapped water. This problem is of
signifi cant importance in a tunnel construction
because of fl ooding of the tunnel cavity with
water involves costly treatment. Figure 3.31
shows a dam abutment with folded (anticline),
faulted, and jointed rocks. Erosion of the soft
materials along the fault has resulted in a wide
fi ssure.
The rocks of the Himalayan terrain are known
for complex folding associated with faults and

thrusting of the rocks of the Himalayas can be obtained by consulting the maps and publications
of Geological Survey of India of the concerned area. Geological mapping of the area may then
be taken up to reveal the details of the structures and their effect on the construction sites.
3.7.2 Harmful Effects of Faults
Among the different geological structures, checking the presence of a fault at a construction
site is crucial because of its harmful effects. In many sites, the existence of a fault is not so
apparent on the surface due to the cover of overburden materials, but after excavation of the
site, the faulted zone is visible. A fault consists of shattered rocks that create weakness to the
foundation, threatening differential settlement of
the structure, seepage of water, and development

of uplift pressure. A site traversed by a fault
showing presence of breccia, sheared rock, and
clayey zone called gouge involves expensive
treatment of the foundation. Figure 3.32 shows

and fault breccia. The intensity of the problem
increases with the increase in thickness of

depthwise extension. As such, wherever possible,
a site with the presence of a major fault with thick
zone of crushed rocks should be avoided. After
a fault is detected from fi eld investigation, it is
necessary to fi nd if it is active or not. An active
Fig. 3.32 A fault zone in the foundation of Umiam fault will have originated in a geologically recent
dam, Meghalaya time (Holocene or Pleistocene). A Pleistocene
fault may be identifi ed from its effects on alluvial
terraces. An active fault is liable to initiate further earthquake movement along its fault plane
within the life of a project. Hence, a site with an active fault should not be considered for
construction of heavy structures.
When a fault zone is postulated traversing the structural site of a project, it is required to take
up pitting, trenching, or tunnelling along the probable fault zone to confi rm its presence and study
the effect. Whenever required, geophysical method is applied to prove its existence and fi nd its
condition at the subsurface. When a fault is detected in a project area from surface observation,
parameters such as the width of shattering, the nature of crushed materials present (gouge, fault
breccia, etc.), and its attitudes (such as trend and dip) with respect to important directions of the
proposed engineering structures should be evaluated. The magnitude of the problem and economics
of the treatment of the site affected by the fault are then considered to accept or reject the site.
3.7.3 Weakness of Rocks Caused by Joints, Fractures, and Other Features
Joints and fractures are universally present in all varieties of rocks. These are clearly visible in
exposed rock after the excavation of a site for the foundation of engineering structures. Drill
cores also indicate their presence in rocks at the depths. In engineering geological investigations,
the nature, intensity, and permeability characteristics of the joints and fractures are studied
from the outcrops as well as from drill cores at the planning stage of a project. The results of
Chapter_03.indd 70 10/27/2012 12:47:21 PM
Rock Structures and Their Engineering Signifi cance ● 71
geological studies on joints along with fi eld permeability test data are required by the engineers
for designing appropriate measures to strengthen and consolidate the jointed rocks.
Joints are the primary means of movement of surface and subsurface water through all
types of rocks. They provide the bulk porosity and permeability of rock mass. Weathering
and alteration of joints create larger avenues for entry of surface water to the deeper parts
of the rock body. Clayey infi llings in joints enhance rock slide by lubrication effect of the
clayey or soapy materials. Presence of intensive joints in foundation reduces the strength
of the rock and poses problems of uplift pressure and leakage through dam foundation and
reservoir.
A tunnel pierced parallel to trends of foliation planes or joints is liable to create extensive roof
falls and overbreaks. As such, it should be aligned at right angle to the trends of joints, fractures,
and foliations of rocks. Roads running parallel to steep-dipping bedding and foliation joints
bring about rock slides and obstruction of vehicle movement (Fig. 3.33). A dam may fail by slip
along the direction of low-dipping bedding joints
of layered rocks. Infi llings in joints require study
with respect to the nature and tightness of the
fi lled materials. Silica solution and veins of many
minerals may completely seal the joints that
enhance the strength of the rock and prevent any
leakage through them. However, loose infi lling
of joints by clay, silts, and calcareous materials
create weakness to the foundation. Clay minerals
such as montmorillonite may cause heaving
when soaked with water. Iron oxide coating
of joints is also harmful and as such requires
cleaning when present in the rocks of structural
foundation.
Fig. 3.33 Extensive joints (along strike and dip) in A massive sandstone bed generally provides
hill slope rocks along a highway causing rock fall and

disposition. However if they contain block joints
may cause rock slide or rock fall. Porous and permeable sedimentary beds such as poorly
compacted sandstone and conglomerate infl uence the fl ow of water through the void spaces
and development of uplift pressure. Sedimentary rocks with alternate shale and sandstone beds
dipping at low angles may pose the problem of sliding.
Soluble rocks such as limestone and marl may initiate leakage of reservoir water through
interconnected solution cavities formed by solution action along bedding planes, joints,
and faults. Bedding planes containing clay seams and soft organic matter, when present in
foundation, create the problem of settlement. Clayey siltstone having low compressive strength
may initiate plastic deformation and shear failure. Clay minerals (e.g., montmorillonite) present
in some clay or shale beds may result in swelling under saturated conditions.
Sedimentary rocks containing primary structures such as mud cracks, sole marks, and fl ute
casts are vulnerable to easy weathering and erosion. Well-developed foliation of metamorphic
rocks is a weak feature, as along the planes of foliation the rocks are more susceptible to decay.
Presence of large quantities of mica in some varieties of schists renders the rock unsuitable for
foundation purposes. Volcanic rocks containing soft breccia, amygdaloidal fl ow, or red bole if
present in a dam foundation may cause seepage and foundation settlement.

4.1 INTRODUCTION
Weathering is the breaking down of rocks. No rock is immune to weathering.
It includes two processes—physical or mechanical weathering and chemical
weathering. Any process that exerts stress on a rock and eventually causes it to
break into smaller fragments is mechanical weathering. Thermal stress is the main
reason for mechanical weathering. Plant roots that develop along cracks and joints
in rocks expand them, eventually resulting in their crumbling. Chemical weathering
involves the direct effect of atmospheric chemicals or biologically produced
chemicals in the breakdown of rocks. Chemical weathering by biological processes
may cause complete breakdown of rocks including their minerals and also result
in the production of new minerals. Hydrolysis, frost action, and salt crystal growth
are associated with the chemical weathering of rocks. This chapter explains all the
processes associated with weathering of rocks along with illustrations, including
fi eld photographs.
4.2 TYPES OF WEATHERING
Many pathways or processes are involved in weathering; however, they can be
classifi ed mainly into two groups, namely physical or mechanical weathering and
chemical weathering. In fact, the structure and composition of a rock are altered
by the physical and chemical factors present in the atmosphere such as water, air,
organic acids from vegetable decay, and even minute organisms.
Mechanical weathering includes processes that involve the breakdown of
rocks into fragments or their disintegration into smaller pieces without altering
Chapter_04.indd 74 10/19/2012 12:21:44 PM
Weathering of Rocks and its Impact on Engineering Constructions ● 75
their mineral composition. Thus, mechanical weathering destroys a rock but leaves its chemical
composition unchanged. Rocks on the earth’s surface are not only subjected to chemical attacks,
but also subjected to the abrasive and grinding actions of the atmospheric forces, including wind
and water. Temperature variation may also cause drying and cooling and ultimate fracturing in
exposed rocks. When water that seeps into cracks freezes to form ice, it widens the cracks,
resulting in the crumbling of rocks.
Chemical weathering is the alteration of rocks into new minerals. Geological processes that
bring about chemical weathering or result in the alteration of rocks may originate deep within
the earth. Burning or melting of rocks by molten lava or washing of rocks by acidic water are
examples. Water and minerals react and exchange atoms with the rock materials in chemical
weathering.
The process of weathering may also be considered as the disintegration of rocks and their
decomposition. Here, disintegration refers to the weathering process that involves physical
agents such as temperature changes—freezing and thawing, and decomposition refers to the
changes in rocks caused by chemical agents.
Both the processes contribute to weathering, but
one process may dominate the other. The type
of rock and the climate of the place determine
the kind of weathering that predominates.
However, mechanical and chemical weathering
can go hand in hand and cause destruction of
rocks. Figures 4.1 and 4.2 depict the combined
destructive action of both mechanical and
chemical weathering.

4.3 MECHANICAL WEATHERING
Mechanical weathering exerts stress on rocks that eventually causes it to break into smaller
fragments. In fact, physical strain caused by the environment or living things is a constant
contributor to mechanical weathering of rocks. It is active mainly in very cold and dry climates
and the agents include sharp temperature changes, frost, drought, crystallization, and growth of
plants along rock fractures.
Chapter_04.indd 75 10/19/2012 12:21:44 PM
76 ● Engineering Geology
One of the most important forms of
mechanical weathering is frost weathering,
which is the process of water freezing in rocks,
especially in cold climates. This is illustrated
in Fig. 4.3. Cold weather causes the seeped-in
water in rock joints to freeze and expand, thereby
exerting pressure. This widens the joint openings
and eventually causes the crumbling of the rock
mass. Plant and tree roots that penetrate into the
cracks can also widen them. Earthquakes and
volcanoes, to a lesser extent, also contribute to
the weathering process.
Deformation of rocks also creates avenues of
Fig. 4.3 Mechanical weathering by freezing of water weathering along selective planes of weakness,
resulting in fracturing as shown in Fig. 4.4. Cracks or joints caused by
earthquakes and those widened by plant roots
are easily subjected to both mechanical and
chemical weathering. In case of molten rocks or
lava, the rocks undergo physical phase changes
due to thermal stress.
Some of the important agents that are
responsible for mechanical weathering are
described in the following sub-sections.
4.3.1 Thermal Stress
Thermal stress results from the expansion or
contraction of rocks, caused by temperature
changes. It comprises two main types, namely
thermal shock and thermal fatigue. In deserts,
there is a signifi cant difference between the day
and night temperatures. The stress exerted on
Fig. 4.4 Selective weathering in a deformed (folded)
the outer layers of the rocks because of such
rock mass along the trough parts
temperature difference can cause those layers to
peel off in thin sheets. Moreover, the cold and moisture of the night also enhance thermal
expansion, though the day is the principal driver in this change process. There is a continuous
alternation of compression and tensile stresses because of the temperature changes. If the
pores of a rock contain water, then when the water freezes, it expands and the rock fails in
tension further weakening the joints and cracks. Forest fi res also cause weathering of rocks
and boulders to a signifi cant extent because the sudden intense heat can rapidly expand a
boulder.
4.3.2 Spheroidal Weathering and Block Disintegration
Spheroidal weathering is the fl aking of highly heated, exposed rock as it expands more than the
cooler rock underneath it. This process produces rounded rock mass structures (Fig. 4.5) and some-
times exfoliation domes (Fig. 4.6). It is less common in sedimentary rocks than in igneous rocks.
This process is predominant in granitic rocks where the process of disintegration happens
Chapter_04.indd 76 10/19/2012 12:21:45 PM
Weathering of Rocks and its Impact on Engineering Constructions ● 77
through a layer-by-layer removal to evolve
towards rounded forms (see Fig. 4.5)
The process of block disintegration results
from sharp temperature changes causing
expansion and contraction of rocks, especially
in very dry climatic conditions. This results in
the enlargement of the joints in the rock, which
ultimately splits into smaller blocks (Fig. 4.7).
Sometimes, some peculiar features may also
develop as a result of such mechanical weathering.
4.3.3 Frost Action

The process wherein snow or ice inside cracks cause

their expansion and the ultimate fragmentation
of the rock is known as frost weathering, frost
wedging, or ice wedging (Fig. 4.8). This process
causes freeze–thaw weathering and is found
mainly in the cold mountainous regions such
as the Himalayan terrains in India, where the
temperatures rise above and fall below the freezing
point. Water expands as it freezes and widens the
crevices in rocks until they shatter into pieces.
Freezing also causes granular disintegration of
porous rocks such as chalk.
The end product of frost action may be cone-
shaped deposits of slope materials called scree or

talus, seen at the foothills (Fig. 4.9). A talus cone
is developed by the accumulation of broken rock
pieces in various shapes and sizes at the base of
a mountain cliff or steep hill slopes. Landforms
associated with these deposited materials may
be very thick and are known as talus piles. They
have a concave upward form while the maximum
slope angle corresponds to the angle of repose
of the debris. Such piles of debris may also
be formed by thermal stress or the unloading
processes of mechanical weathering and the
hydration process of chemical weathering,
thereby transforming the hill slope rocks.

other processes causes the underlying rocks to
expand and develop fractures parallel to the surface. It also promotes sheeting or peeling of rock
from the inner mass into a series of concentric shells. Retreat of an overlying glacier, which

is seen along a joint plane in the front)
is a mechanical weathering process of rocks, can
also lead to disintegration of rock mass due to the
pressure release phenomenon (Fig. 4.10).
4.3.5 Slacking and Haloclasty
Slacking is the process that causes the crumbling
of rocks when exposed to air or moisture. It is
more apparent in clay-rich sedimentary rocks as
they dry out during drought. Crystallization of
salts, which is also known as haloclasty, causes
Fig. 4.10 Disintegration of rock mass by pressure the disintegration of rocks when water (acidic
release (unloading) with the retreat of glacier in parts solution) seeps into cracks and joints in rocks
of Alaska and evaporates, leaving the salt crystals behind.
When heated up, the salt crystals expand and
exert pressure on the confi ning rock. This process splits the rock and honeycomb structures
develop on its surface. The salts that are most effective in disintegrating a rock are sodium
sulphate, magnesium sulphate, and calcium chlorite. These three salts may expand up to three
times their volume or even more.
4.3.6 Hydraulic Action
In coastal areas, when water from powerful waves rushes rapidly into the cracks on the rock
face, hydraulic action takes place. This causes the trapping of a layer of air at the bottom of the
cracks, which compresses them and weakens the rock. When the waves retreat, the trapped air
is suddenly released with an explosive force. This causes widening of the cracks or crumbling
of the rock, thereby hastening the process of weathering (Fig. 4.11).

4.3.7 Tree Root Action
Tree roots can widen the joints and fractures in
rocks as they grow up, causing weakness and
ultimately the crumbling of the rock mass. This
is a frequently observed process of physical
weathering. The disintegration process is
activated by the exposure of the rock, especially
by the removal of soil cover. Vegetation in the
absence of soil cover may appear to be a minor
factor in rock fracturing or rock disintegration, but
tree roots, where present, may actually widen the

acid called carbonic acid. Microbe respiration
generates abundant soil carbon dioxide, and
rainwater percolating through the soil provides
the required water. Carbonic acid slowly dissolves

the minerals in rocks, especially the carbonate
bedrock causing their widening and fracturing
minerals that make up limestone and marble.
Second, water can be adsorbed onto the mineral lattice, which is known as the process of
hydration. The conversion of anhydride into gypsum is an example. Finally, water can break up
minerals through hydrolysis, which can take place both at the surface and at the shallow depths,
wherever water is circulating through the rock. Large crystals of igneous and metamorphic
silicate minerals decay into tiny fl akes of clay minerals. These minerals are all hydrated,
having an OH component derived from the water, and often water itself, H O. Thus, the most
2
common group of minerals, the silicates, is decomposed by hydrolysis. The reactive hydrogen
ions liberated from water attack the crystal lattices of the minerals. In the process, new and
secondary minerals may develop from the original minerals of the rock.
In humid climates, rocks are affected aggressively by chemical weathering. The chief
destructive agents are rain, water, and certain mineral contents. These dissolve some kind of rocks
or rot the natural cements that bind the particles in the rock together. However, certain minerals
such as quartz are more resistant than augite, biotite, hornblende, or orthoclase. The important
ways of rock decay by chemical weathering are described in the following sub-sections.
4.4.1 Oxidation
Oxidation happens when atmospheric oxygen combines with the compound (minerals) in some
rocks. The most commonly observed oxidation process is that of Fe2+ (iron) and its combination

with oxygen and water to form Fe3+ hydroxides and oxides such as hematite, limonite, and
goethite. This gives the affected rock a reddish-brown colouration on the surface, which crumbles
easily and weakens the rock. This process is better known as rusting. Many other metallic ores
and minerals oxidize and hydrate to produce coloured deposits, such as chalcopyrite as CuFeS
2
oxidizing to copper hydroxide and iron oxides.
4.4.2 Carbonation
Carbonation is a solution weathering process that is caused by the minerals in the rocks
reacting with water containing a considerable amount of carbon dioxide. It may produce
harmful effects in a limestone terrain. Limestone is readily dissolved by rainwater, which is
acidifi ed by carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or soil. The reactions are as follows:

pavement which are called grikes. The surfaces or ridges are called
clints. Thus, limestone pavements may form such features
of grikes and clints as a result of carbonation, a process of
chemical weathering (Fig. 4.13). The terms grikes and clints
originated from the dialect of Northern England, where
such features were fi rst found in limestone pavements (Fig.

4.4.3 Hydration
Hydration involves chemical addition of water
to the minerals of certain rocks. When some
minerals take up water and expand, they result in
the breakage of shells from the rocks. Water thus
added is be distinguished from the type of water
that promotes disintegration process.
Tor is generally formed in granite as a
result of millions of years of weathering. The
name ‘tor’ originates from Dartmoor in the
UK where granite blocks of varying sizes,
after weathering, form tors covering a large
area. It is stated that the rocks overlying the
granite plutons got eroded with the consequent

Granite splits joints in granite and tended to give them the shape of blocks. Then,
into blocks chemical weathering by the process of hydration caused extreme
breakage of the hard granite along these joints to create tors, which
Joints widens are cubic or sub-rounded blocks (Fig. 4.15). Such features are also
found in the rocks of various countries. Figure 4.16 represents a tor
in the rocks of Kenya. Tors are also prevalent in the granitic rocks
of peninsular India, especially in Andhra Pradesh.
4.4.4 Hydrolysis
Hydrolysis involves the chemical addition of water to the minerals
of rocks, which results in a chemical reaction. Water thus added is

Hydrolysis contributes to the breakdown of micas, amphibole, and many metamorphic
minerals. This process can take place on the surface as well as in sub-surface conditions where
water is circulating through the rock. In some cases, a granite body at a depth may turn into
a deposit of kaolinite of economic importance and can be quarried as a source of china clay.
However, in some granite foundations of engineering structures, deep-seated conversion of
feldspar into kaolin creates construction problems.
When pyroxene and olivine react with water, magnesium and silicon are carried away in
solution but the remaining iron reacts with oxygen to form the solid residue hematite (Fe O ),
2 3
which is a mineral form of iron oxide. The hydrolysis process of chemical weathering is much
common in rocks. Carbonic acid is consumed by silicate weathering, resulting in more alkaline
solutions because of the bicarbonate. This is an important reaction in controlling the amount of
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and can affect the climate.
The only common mineral that is immune to
chemical attack is quartz (SiO ). Although it is
2
soluble in acidic groundwater, this is applicable
only for quartz released by chemical breakdown.
However, quartz itself is insoluble under surface
conditions.
4.5 BIOLOGICAL WEATHERING
In addition to mechanical and chemical
weathering, rocks are also altered and decomposed
by biological weathering (Fig. 4.17). The main
agent in biological weathering is the organic acids
released by organisms such as bacteria, lichens,
Fig. 4.16 Tor of Kenya formed by the process of
hydration (Source: Wikipedia, 2011) mosses, and decaying plants of many types.
Chapter_04.indd 81 10/19/2012 12:21:48 PM
82 ● Engineering Geology
Fig. 4.17 Rocks attacked by biological weathering
The acids attack the rock-forming minerals. The mineral composition can also be initiated and
accelerated by soil organisms.
The most common forms of biological weathering are the release of chelating compounds (i.e.,
organic acids) and of acidifying molecules (i.e., protons, organic acids) by plants so as to break down
aluminium- and iron-containing compounds in the soils beneath them. The decaying remains of dead
plants in soil may form organic acids, which when dissolved in water cause chemical weathering.
Some kind of fungi associated with the root systems can release inorganic nutrients from
minerals such as biotite and transfer these nutrients to the trees, thus contributing to tree
nutrition. It has also been evidenced that bacterial communities can impact mineral stability,
leading to the release of inorganic nutrients.
4.6 EFFECT OF WEATHERING DUE TO CLIMATIC CONDITIONS AND GEOLOGIC TIME
The rate of weathering depends on many factors. First, weathering will be faster if there is more
water in the system. This is why chemical weathering tends to be faster in the hot and humid
tropics. Second, the higher the temperature, the faster is the weathering. Third, the more the mineral
surface area is exposed in the rock by joints, the faster will be the weathering. The increased
number of cracks in the rocks will allow the agents of water and oxygen to interact more intensely
with the minerals. Finally, the mineral composition of the rock is also a factor of weathering.
Felsic igneous rocks tend to weather much faster than the igneous rocks with more quartz grains.
What would happen to an outcrop of granite that was exposed to the agents of weathering in a
humid and warm environment over millions of years? The agents would slowly deteriorate the rock
and liberate the quartz grains, which are very resistant to chemical weathering and would be deposited
as sand grains in the stream beds, beaches, and dunes. The feldspars would be decomposed as kaolin
and will ultimately form clay and salt mixed with other decomposed minerals. The amphibole
and biotite minerals would form iron oxides and clays. Most of the salt would be taken away by
groundwater or washed away by surface water into the seas to render salinity to the sea water. Clays,
over a long geologic time, will form shale, which is the most abundant of the sedimentary rocks.
Chemical weathering produces salts and clay and forms canyons and gorges. Mountains and
islands are the result of massive mechanical weathering caused by huge shifts in continental
plates that smash together to make mountains or break off and create islands. In a way,
mechanical weathering produces mountains, cliffs, plateaus, and islands.
4.7 IMPACT OF WEATHERING ON ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTIONS
Weathering has great signifi cance in engineering geological works. Weathered rock is a weak
feature for use as foundation for engineering structures. Such features of rock disintegration
Chapter_04.indd 82 10/19/2012 12:21:49 PM
Weathering of Rocks and its Impact on Engineering Constructions ● 83
and decomposition may remain hidden under the soil cover or at a depth, which could be
detected when the excavation exposes the surface. This may involve a change of design or even
the rejection of the project though it has started, resulting in increased project cost; hence, it
requires the important consideration of the project management.
4.7.1 Engineering Geological Signifi cance
As seen in the formation of blocks and joints, very hard rocks are also separated into small
blocks due to weathering. When a heavy structure such as a concrete dam is constructed over
such rocks, the blocks may move slowly over a certain period of time, and ultimately, the
structure may fail. Hence, a cautious approach is needed while selecting the site for heavy
structures because even apparently hard rocks can be affected by weathering and form blocks and
joints.
At the investigation stage of a project, it is necessary to check whether the foundation of the
engineering site contains any weathered rock. If a weathered rock portion is present at a shallow
depth, it is to be thoroughly scaled out before laying the foundation for structures such as dams,
powerhouses, and huge buildings. Even in sub-surface projects such as tunnels or underground
powerhouses, or in a dam or bridge site covered by thick riverine deposit, it is necessary to confi rm
the depth of fresh rock under the weathered rock or river debris by geophysical survey or exploratory
drilling. Accordingly, the structural foundation should be designed in fresh and sound rock.
It should be noted that a few scattered exposures of sound rocks do not prove the presence
of sound rock conditions underneath, especially in a granitic terrain. A thorough examination,
especially by seismic refraction method and drilling, is necessary to prove the presence of
sound rock covering the foundation area of the engineering structure. In Orissa, during the
excavation of a dam site, a large thick zone of kaolinite clay was found to be present underneath
a shallow cover of river deposits. Several exposures of sound granite were present at the surface
close to the foundation of the dam site. The depth and extent of the weathering of granite that
had been altered to kaolinite clay found during the excavation was so extensive that the dam
could not be constructed at the proposed site. The site had to be shifted.
Moreover, care should also be taken in the selection and use of construction materials for
engineering structures. No portion of these materials should contain disintegrated or decomposed
rocks. Use of even partly weathered rock either as a block or as a concrete aggregate should be
avoided for engineering constructions, as such rocks may also rot because of long exposure to
atmosphere and result in the failure of the structure.

5.1 INTRODUCTION
This chapter deals with the different geological processes and their activities that
give rise to various types of soils on which many engineering structures such
as buildings, highways, runways, and even dams and bridges are constructed. It
explains with illustrations the destruction and different stages of weathering of rocks
that eventually produce soil. The chapter also describes the geological processes
such as erosion of rock and transportation and deposition of eroded particles that
give rise to the soils. It further discusses the depositional environment giving rise to
various types of soils including their engineering uses. It provides a detailed account
of Indian soils with their origin and places of occurrence and elucidates the different
types of clay minerals and their effects on the soils.
5.2 GEOLOGICAL PROCESSES RESPONSIBLE FOR SOIL FORMATION
Geological processes are responsible for the formation of soils of varied types, which are
of importance in engineering constructions, such as a dam built across a river valley, a
tunnel excavated through an escarpment, or a road aligned along a hill slope composed
of soil and overburden materials. In fact, processes such as erosion, transportation,
and deposition of soil have been actively associated with changing lands of the earth’s
surface since a long geological time. Water, wind, and ice are the main agents associated
with the processes that produce soils and cause their transportation. An understanding
of these processes that control the land patterns is necessary to examine the merits and
demerits of a site while carrying out an engineering geological investigation.

5.2.1 Formation of Soil from Weathering and Decomposition of Rocks
Weathering of rocks of the uppermost crust of the earth is a complex process of disintegration
and decomposition of rock body and has been elaborated in Chapter 4. The disintegration or
breakdown of rocks results from alternate heating and cooling caused by periodical temperature
changes and also from the actions of wind and ice. If the water in the fi ssures and pore spaces of
rocks freezes during cold conditions, the rock body tends to expand and develops cracks, which
hasten the disintegration process. Sometimes, tree roots also penetrate the fi ne fi ssures of rocks
and develop big cracks causing further deterioration and disintegration. Landforms in warm
and dry climate are prone to weathering mostly by disintegration of rocks. Decomposition
of rocks results from chemical processes such as oxidation, hydration, carbonation, and
leaching of organic acids. The decay of vegetation produces organic acids, which cause further
decomposition of rocks, with the ultimate product being soil. This aspect of mechanical and
chemical weathering has been described in detail in Chapter 4.
Decomposition of rocks produces soil with clay minerals. Expansive soil consisting of
swelling type of clay minerals is harmful if present in the foundation of a structure. Weathering
of rocks due to decomposition is more prolifi c in lands experiencing a warm and humid
climate. The tropical climate of India with high rainfall (monsoon rains) is responsible for the
excessive disintegration as well as decomposition of rocks that has produced rich deposits of
soil conducive for agricultural growth of the country.
The works of several authors (Fookes et al. 1971; Knill et al. 1970) have established that
the weathering of rocks that produce soil is the combined effect of physical disintegration,
chemical decomposition, and solution of rocks. These zones of disintegration and
decomposition are dependent on the topographic features, rock types, and structure of
rocks in the concerned area. Rocks in slopes with uneven surfaces are prone to substantial
weathering. When the rocks are subjected to structural disturbances due to folding, faulting,
jointing, or fi ssuring, the process of weathering becomes intense giving rise to thick zones
of soils (Fig. 5.1).
Weathering of rocks such as mudstone and tuff causes only iron stains along joint surfaces,
but limestone is more decomposed and goes into solution more easily along joints and other
structural planes. The solution action results in the following two types of conditions:
(i) When a soluble rock such as limestone is argillaceous in nature, the mechanical action and
solution effect will both be operative in the weathering process resulting in the removal of
more materials.
Fig. 5.1 Weathering and disintegration of rocks into soil

Soil Formation, Engineering Classifi cation, and Description of Indian Soils ● 87
(ii) However, if limestone contains very little insoluble material, the solution of the rock
will produce voids due to the removal of rock material by solution from the planes of
discontinuities.
5.2.2 Residual and Transported Soils
Soil covering only the top part of the bedrock from which it has been derived is known as
residual soil. In other words, a deposit of residual soil remains in the same position capping
the parent rock since its origin. A bedrock undergoes different stages or grades of weathering
to form residual soil (Fig. 5.2). These gradations of weathering, applicable for soil formation
from all types of bedrocks, are based on the conditions of the structure, texture, and mineral
contents from initial to advance stages of weathering. Table 5.1 provides a classifi cation of the
weathering grades.

Table 5.1 Classifi cation of weathering grades (IAEG, 1981)
Grade I—Unweathered or fresh rock No visible sign of weathering. Rock is fresh and crystal bright. Few
discontinuities with slight weathering.
Grade II—Slightly weathered rock Penetrative weathering developed on open discontinuity surfaces but
only slight weathering of materials. Discontinuities are discoloured
and discolouration can enter into rock up to a few millimetres from
discontinuity surface.
Grade III—Moderately weathered rock Slight discolouration extends through greater part of rock mass.
The rock material is friable (except in the case of poorly cemented
sedimentary rocks). Discontinuities are stained or fi lled with altered
material.
Grade IV—Highly weathered rock Weathering extends throughout the rock mass and the material is
partly friable. The rock has no lustre. All materials except quartz are
discoloured. The rock can be excavated with a geologists’ pick.
Grade V—Completely or extremely The rock is totally discoloured and decomposed and is in a friable
weathered rock condition. Only fragments of the rock structure are preserved. The
external appearance is that of a soil.
Grade VI—Residual soil Soil material with complete disintegration of texture, structure, and
mineralogy of parent rock.
Chapter_05.indd 87 10/18/2012 5:02:57 PM
88 ● Engineering Geology
The residual soil deposits are of limited
thickness varying roughly between 15 m and
60 m and prevalent in hill slopes (Fig. 5.3) and
also in parts of plateau regions. The black soil
mantle of the Deccan basalts and the lateritic soil
occurring in different parts of India are examples
of residual soils. Residual soil formed of hard
rocks such as granite and charnockite may be
better for foundation than that derived from
sedimentary rocks such as shale, sandstone, and
limestone. In a limestone terrain, thick deposits
of residual soil derived from limestone may
Fig. 5.3 Extensive weathering and erosion of hill possess caverns and sinkholes hidden below the
slope forming soil soil. Hence, if a storage structure or reservoir is
constructed in such a terrain, there may be leakage of reservoir water. Residual soil with good
plasticity and of impermeable nature provides favourable foundation conditions for an earth
dam. Such soil also serves as the impervious core of an embankment or rock-fi ll dam.
Soil formed of materials transported and deposited away from its original place of formation
is called transported soil. The deposit of transported soil may be very thick. The alluvial soil
covering the Indo-Gangetic plains of India is an example of transported soil varying in thickness
between 100 m and 5000 m. Transported soil does not retain the ingredients of the parent rock
even down below the deposits of such soil. The products of different stages of weathering of the
bedrock that form the residual soil are also not present.
In general, transported soil is a mixture of particles derived from rocks of two or more
regions and also of reworked sediments. This may be deposited in a homogeneous manner with
well-sorted grains or in a heterogeneous manner with assorted particles depending upon the
manner of their transportation and condition of deposition. Transported soils frequently contain
lenses or layers of organic matters harmful for construction of engineering structures. However,
due to the widespread occurrence of such soils, engineering structures such as roads, rails,
airports, and other buildings are constructed on this soil after adopting suitable safety measures
in the design of the structures.
5.2.3 Erosion, Transportation, and Deposition
Geological processes such as erosion, transportation, and deposition bring about changes
in the landform by eroding the rock types that give rise to soil deposits. Structural habits,
especially discontinuities in rocks, accentuate the process of erosion. Water fl owing through
soft rock causes rapid erosion. A fault zone having soft materials is subjected to easy erosion
providing path for a river channel. In sedimentary rock formations with soft rocks or alternated
with beds of hard and soft rocks, the softer beds may be easily eroded creating deep valleys
or gorges. Igneous rocks such as granite and basalt are hard and less eroded compared to
sedimentary rocks. In metamorphic rocks, soft bands such as mica schists are easily eroded by
running water.
Rocks affected by joints and faults are subject to rapid erosion and transportation of the
material on the downstream side. Sometimes, a large rock body gets eroded and forms soil but
the hard core remains standing in the midst of the soil appearing like a sculpture (Fig. 5.4).
Erosion is associated with weathering that brings about a superfi cial change of rock mass.
Chapter_05.indd 88 10/18/2012 5:02:57 PM
Soil Formation, Engineering Classifi cation, and Description of Indian Soils ● 89
Chemical weathering of rock also results in rapid
erosion, eventually leading to the formation of
soil. Spheroidal weathering, common in igneous
rocks, is a type of chemical weathering that creates
rounding of rock mass and formation of
boulders, thus hastening the process of soil
formation.
Some rocks such as limestone and dolomite,
in addition to erosion, are subjected to solution
effect under acidic water. Rainwater passing
through the soil and vegetation becomes
slightly acidic and this causes the solution of
the limestone. Sandstone with calcareous matter
also gets eroded easily. The process of solution
causes formation of big cavities in the surface
and subsurface regions of limestone. Hence,
Fig. 5.4 Naturally formed sculpture, resembling a
the presence of limestone in a dam foundation
snowman wearing a cap
or reservoir may create problems of leakage and
subsidence. In the case of argillaceous limestone, solution and erosion processes act together
resulting in rapid removal and deposition of the material in the form of transported soil.
Many of the river valleys in the mountainous terrains with folded rocks are formed in the
anticline part of the fold due to easy erosion of this part containing extensive number of joints
and fractures. In glaciated mountains, the ice sheet comes down eroding the bedrock at the
bottom. Sometimes, sudden fall of a huge mass of ice (avalanche) takes place in the lower parts
of the mountains with accumulation of debris from melting ice. This creates large deposits of
glacial materials (drifts) in the high-altitude glaciated terrains. Such glaciated materials are
prevalent in the high mountain slopes of the Himalayas.
Floods, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions also bring about large-scale changes in land
surface and help in the formation of soil deposits. Floods carry huge loads of silt that gets
deposited in the rivers and surrounding terrains reducing the life of a reservoir if located there.
Earthquakes cause catastrophic changes in landform features and complete destruction of man-
made structures. Flow of lava due to volcanic outbursts destroys existing land surface and creates
new landforms. Man also acts as an agent in changing the land space. Excessive steepening of
a hill slope by cutting for a road may result in rock slide or debris slide. Deforestation for land
development expedites erosion and brings about changes in the morphology within a short time
along with a change in the atmospheric conditions. Detritus or loose soil is easily washed away
and deposited elsewhere and the land becomes a desert-like terrain. This process of changing
landform patterns and formation of detritus or soil deposits began in the geological past and
still continues.
5.3 GLACIAL AND FLUVIOGLACIAL ACTIONS
Glaciers are thick ice sheets that move like a stream slowly along hill slopes. The ice sheets
erode and abrade the uneven hill slopes to produce channels for their movement. When the ice
melts, the eroded materials are deposited as glacial drifts in different structural forms.

5.3.1 Features of Glacial Activity Including Old Remnants
The most prominent features formed from the deposition of a glacier by melting of the ice
sheet during its downward movement are moraines, drumlins, and eskers (Fig. 5.5). If the
deposition of the materials is perpendicular to the direction of movement of ice sheets, it forms
terminal moraine. When the accumulation of the
heterogeneous materials takes place in front of
the ice sheets, it is termed ground moraine. These

are formed when the drifts are accumulated on
depressions on the receding path of ice sheets.

to thousands of metres.
In the geological past, India experienced several glacial invasions that left their existence in
the form of heterogeneous mixtures of unconsolidated sediments. The Talchir tillites formed
of glacial till is an evidence of a glacial invasion during the Gondwana age. The striations and
polished surface characteristics of glacial movements are present in the rocks immediately
below the Talchir beds. Pleistocene India experienced at least four glaciations as evident from
the piled-up glacial deposits in the foothill regions of the north-west Himalayas. Several large
glaciers are at present active in the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. They carry piles of
sediments and deposit the drifts in the downhill areas with the melting of ice sheets (Fig. 5.6).

5.3.2 Problems of Engineering Construction in Glacial Deposits
Construction of any engineering structure in deposits of glacial origin will encounter problems
of permeability and stability. Due to heterogeneity and lack of compactness of the materials,
founding a dam on this soil will lead to differential settlement. A reservoir spread on this soil
may experience leakage due to the permeable nature of the material. Construction of a highway
or road traversing hill slopes formed of glacial drifts may have to deal with the problem of
slope failure for which extensive drainage arrangement is necessary in addition to compactness.
For a major construction in the high-altitude terrain of the Himalayas close to a glaciated area,
the feasibility stage investigation should include a study on the stability and permeability of
the glacial drifts. In addition, glaciological investigation is necessary in uphill terrain to collect
information pertaining to snow line, the rate of movement of ice sheets, the volume of load
depositing in the downstream parts by melting ice sheets, the chance of avalanche striking the
proposed structure, and other activities of the glaciers.
5.3.3 Fluvioglacial and Glacial Lacustrine Deposits
In some areas, both ice and water may take part in forming huge deposits. For example,
the outwash materials of glaciers accumulated at the toe of the hills are transported by river
water and deposited in rivers or lakes to form
fl uvioglacial deposits. These deposits exhibit
the characteristics of alluvial deposits of
simple river origin, but the heterogeneity of the
sediments of glacial deposits is absent in them.
Figure 5.7 shows the fl uvioglacial deposits at
the Himalayan foothills where melting of glacial
ice forms huge debris comprising boulders and
pebbles that are deposited on the sides as the
water fl ows as streams.
The deposition of glacial sediments in lakes
due to glacial melt water results in glacial
Fig. 5.7 Fluvioglacial deposits at the Himalayan
lacustrine deposits. These are formed by fi lling
foothills
the depressions or blocking the course of a
stream by ice sheets. The sediments of the glacial lacustrine deposits are rock powder, clay, and
silt-size particles. The settlement of the particles takes place very slowly in the still water of
the lakes, resulting in very thin and horizontally layered deposits called varves. It takes nearly
a year to form one layer of silt and one layer of clay, each less than a centimetre in thickness.
Both fl uvioglacial and glacial lacustrine deposits are permeable in nature. Laying roads on
these deposits will have the same problem as that of the deposits of glacial origin. The size,
texture, and properties such as porosity and permeability vary in the different layers of varves.
The overall material has a low-bearing capacity having clay in its ingredients, which may create
settlement problems if a heavy structure is constructed in such deposits.
5.4 WIND ACTION AND WINDBORNE DEPOSITS
Wind can carry small particles such as sand and smaller particles. The power of wind to erode
depends on particle size, wind strength, and whether the particles are able to be picked up by
the wind. Wind is an important force causing erosion. It is more prevalent in arid regions than
Chapter_05.indd 91 10/18/2012 5:02:59 PM
92 ● Engineering Geology
humid regions. In arid regions, sand dunes are common. These are wind deposits that come in
different shapes, depending on winds and sand availability.
5.4.1 Sand Dunes
Wind-blown loose sands from plains create dunes, which are found in different structural forms
(Fig. 5.8). Sand-laden wind erodes the rock mass of hills and may form a fl at terrain full of loose
sand-size clastic particles of quartz, feldspar, and mica. If the area is windy, the sand-size particles
will be swept away by the wind and deposited elsewhere to form dunes. The dunes may form
geometric patterns of structures such as crescent- or ridge-shaped Barchans or irregular sand deposits.
Dune deposits have a gentle slope (roughly 5–10°) in the wind direction but are rather steep (slope
angle about 30°) in the leeward side. They attain a height of only a few metres to approximately
100 m in their vertical extent of deposition. Dunes are characterized by their mobility from one place
to another caused by the sweeping of the sand due to high winds. Sand dunes with characteristic
features of deposition are found in deserts and along seashores. The sands blown from the Arabian
Sea coast were deposited in parts of Rajasthan giving rise to a desert-like landform with sand dunes.
Stone Age artefacts were found in stratifi ed dune deposits underlying the recent sands providing
evidence of the starting of dune-forming processes tens of thousands of years ago.
(a) (b)
Fig. 5.8 Structure of a dune: (a) Barchan dune; and
(b) Barchanoid ridge (→ indicates wind direction)
Due to the loose and highly permeable nature of sand, stability problems are encountered in
the construction of roads and highways. Any engineering construction in terrains with sand dunes
requires good maintenance. Maintaining the roads is diffi cult because of the migratory nature of
sand dunes. Some species of conifers and long grass are planted in the area as a measure to create
binding of the sands. Sand arrestors are also provided to guard the roads. No structure should be
constructed in areas where sands are very mobile in nature. Canals constructed through the areas
of sand dunes need to be lined due to the porous nature of the deposits.
5.4.2 Loess—Formation and Engineering Problems
Loess is an aeolian (windborne) deposit or soil that is porous and permeable in nature and is
constituted of poorly graded fi ne sand, silt, and clay. It may contain a high content of silt or it
may be a clay-rich soil. Loess shows the phenomenon of hydro-consolidation, that is, the soil
mass will consolidate when it comes in contact with water. The permeability of horizontal
layers in loess is more than that in vertical direction. One type of loess formed by wind-blown
materials, remains in place without undergoing any decomposition. However, in another type,
the soil undergoes chemical decomposition though the place of origin is not shifted. Loess can
withstand very steep slope cuts, at places even upto vertical angles.
Chapter_05.indd 92 10/18/2012 5:02:59 PM
Soil Formation, Engineering Classifi cation, and Description of Indian Soils ● 93
The main problem encountered while constructing a structure on loess is subsidence
under wet conditions. A building constructed on loess may settle and develop cracks. Hence,
construction of heavy structures on loess is avoided because of the threat of settlement. Pile
driving is generally undertaken for constructing building structures on this soil. Grouting of
loess is done to stabilize the soil before undertaking any construction. If the soil is present
in a slope, it may undergo sliding when it comes in contact with water. Berms (step cutting)
are provided as protective measures to loess slopes. Construction of a dam on loess needs
compaction of the soil before founding the structure. To use this soil in the construction of an
earth dam, the soil is to be rolled as per design requirement.
5.5 FORMATION OF TERRACES, TALUS, AND ORGANIC DEPOSITS
The grain-size (textural) distributions of surfi cial material deposits such as glacial till, end
moraines, fi nes (silt and clay), sand, gravel, fl oodplain alluvium, swamp deposits, salt marsh
deposits, and artifi cial fi lls are the main reasons of how the formation of terraces, talus, and
organic deposits will take place. There is a relationship between the depositional origins and
the distribution and character of the surfi cial material deposits. These deposits range from a few
feet to several hundred feet in thickness, overlie the bedrock surface and underlie the organic
soil layer of the site in consideration.
5.5.1 Glacial Terrace
Terrace may be developed in glacial areas when it is called glacial terrace. While fl owing
through a glacial terrain, a river may deposit its bed load in any place along its course due to
the decrease in its rate of fl ow. This causes formation of glacial terrace by the narrowing of the
stream course. A glacial terrace is very wide but is short in longitudinal direction. These terraces
are made of loosely packed, poorly graded heterogeneous materials and any construction such
as roads or highways through these terraces may experience stability problems.
5.5.2 River Terrace
River terraces are formed by deposition of riverborne materials in bench- or step-like slopes
or benches made by the river itself (Fig. 5.9). A river in the mature stage fl owing through
plains may cut a new channel and the old channel is left out as a terrace composed of the river
sediments. Even in the young stage, a stream fl owing through a soft bedrock of a hilly terrain
may gradually deepen its channel fl oor resulting
in benching or terracing of the upper slopes. From
Terrace the hill slope, loose materials may drop on these
Talus
terraces and accumulate as talus. Thus, the fl ow of
a river in both the young and mature stages creates
river terraces. A terrace may also be formed by

developed on the gentle slopes can be used as
sites for constructing roads connecting towns or

5.5.3 Marine Terrace
A Marine terraces are formed along continental coasts.
Powerful waves are created in marine water due to
C
postglacial rise in sea level, when glacial drift and
alluvial material are deposited along the coastal belts.
The deposition creates elevated shorelines. The marine
cliffs and abraded platform along the coasts are raised
abruptly resulting in the formation of marine terraces
B D
(Fig. 5.10). Erosional processes in a later time may
be active along the terraces and bring their partial or
complete obliteration.

cut (A–B) and earlier sea level (C–D)
5.5.4 Talus
Talus is formed of loose debris (called colluvial deposits) accumulated at the base of a cliff
or the bottom of a slope. Here, gravity acts upon uphill materials and brings them down and
deposits them at the toe of the ridge. Because of high porosity and the heterogeneous character
of the deposits, engineering construction is generally avoided on this soil. Screening of the
talus, however, provides gravel- and sand-size particles for use as construction materials.
5.5.5 Organic Soils Including Pits
Organic soils are formed in marshy lands, swamps, and also in shallow lakes. Various types of
water plants, vegetables, and grasses are grown in marshy lands and swamps. In lake water,
the organic materials including vegetable matter are carried and deposited by streams. All
these plant and vegetable matter after decay form organic soils, which are black in colour and
cohesive in nature under dry conditions. However, when wet, the soil loses its cohesiveness.
In some swamps, peats are formed by humifi cation of the plant remnants including seaweeds.
The peats mixed with inorganic materials form peat soil, which is an organic soil showing no
trace of the original ingredients of plants.
Organic soil is highly porous and possesses very low shear strength. It is also prone to slide and
settlement and hence construction of a road or any heavy engineering structure should be avoided
in this soil. The construction of even a light structure requires proper drainage arrangement.
When organic soil is present in parts of a road or rail alignment, it is always better to remove the
portion of the organic soil and backfi ll with suitable types of soils. Pile foundation is necessary
in constructing buildings or other heavy structures in organic soils (see Section 6.16).
5.6 SOILS DERIVED FROM DIFFERENT DEPOSITIONAL REGIMES
Engineering structures are constructed on soils derived from different types of depositional
environments such as river, glacial, lacustrine, marine, and windborne, as discussed in the
preceding sections. Soil deposits of different types of origins are also used as construction
materials depending upon their local availability. A coarse soil with clean gravel is used for
concrete aggregates, and a fi ne-grained plastic soil is used for the impervious core of earth dams.
Water, wind, and ice are the three main agents of the natural processes that erode and abrade
weathered rock surfaces or soil deposits and transport the materials and eventually deposit them
in water or on land. In some areas, gravity also acts as an agent to deposit materials to form soil.
Chapter_05.indd 94 10/18/2012 5:02:59 PM
Soil Formation, Engineering Classifi cation, and Description of Indian Soils ● 95
The soils thus formed are designated differently based on their manner of transportation and
place of deposition as follows:
Alluvial soil Water is the main agent involved in transporting and depositing the sediments.
The transported soil of riverine origin is called alluvial deposit or alluvium. The soil formed
from the transported materials in a lake fl oor or under the sea is called lacustrine soil and marine
soil, respectively. Soil deposits of alluvial, or marine, and lacustrine origin have characteristic
depositional features such as layering of different-size particles, graded bedding, and ripple
marks.
Glacial soil The huge ice sheets of glaciers during their slow movements through the
hilly terrains erode and abrade the rock mass of the hills. The eroded materials consisting
of a heterogeneous mixture of rock powder, clay, silt, sand, gravels, and boulder carried by
the glaciers are called glacial drifts or simply drifts. The material beneath the glacier when
deposited by the ice sheet itself is called till and comprises mostly fi ne silt to clay-size particles.
Both drift and till do not show any layered structure.
Aeolian soil The deposition of wind-blown particles forms Aeolian soil deposits. Loess
and sand dunes are examples of Aeolian deposits. Loess comprises mostly clay- and silt-size
particles without any layering. Dunes are the accumulation of loose sands in different structural
forms that may migrate from one place to another by the action of wind.
Colluvial soil In hilly terrains, the force of gravity takes part in accumulating rock fragments
and eroded materials of the uphill region at the foothills creating soil deposits of heterogeneous
mixture called talus. This type of transported soil is known as colluvial soil.
Soil from volcanic ash Another type of transported soil is the volcanic ash where volcanic
eruption is the main agent of transportation. Several ash beds of geological time are found in the
Deccan traps formed by volcanic activity. Ash deposits of recent origin exist in Hawaii where
volcanoes are active and erupt even today (see Section 20.5).
Organic soil This is derived from chemically decomposed vegetable matter mixed with
sediments transported by streams and deposited in shallow lakes or ponds and swamps. This
is a transported type of organic soil. Peat or peat soil, formed in marshy land and swamps
created by the decay of plants, is a residual type of organic soil. This type of soil is avoided in
engineering works as it may create problems of subsidence and heaving when saturated with
water.
5.7 SOIL CLASSIFICATION FOR ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTIONS
Soil classifi cation is aimed at describing the various types of soil in a systematic way and
at dividing soils of distinct physical properties into groups or units. There are several soil
classifi cations, but engineers are more concerned with the one best applied for the purpose of
engineering constructions. Since Casagrande (1943) evolved the Unifi ed Soils Classifi cation
System for army engineers in the US, it has been widely accepted for varied engineering
purposes such as construction of dams, highways, and other civil engineering structures on
soil. Indian Standard (IS) classifi cation of soils is based on this unifi ed soil classifi cation
after some modifi cations. This classifi cation adopted for civil engineering works has taken
into consideration the size of soil particles, texture of the constituent grains, organic content,
and properties such as plasticity, grading, and compressibility. Soils are broadly grouped into
Chapter_05.indd 95 10/18/2012 5:03:00 PM
96 ● Engineering Geology
three divisions, namely coarse-grained, fi ne-grained, and organic soils. In this classifi cation, the
symbol G stands for gravel, S for sand, M for silt, C for clay, and O for organic.
5.7.1 Coarse-grained Soils
In the coarse-grained soil group, more than 50 per cent of the material by weight will be
retained above the 75-micron sieve. The basic components of soils of this division are boulder,
cobbles, gravel, and sand. The size range of these components is given in Section 5.7.3. In the
IS classifi cation, the nature of grading and mixing of the soils under the divisions gravels and
sands are designated by the symbols W for well-graded and clean, C for well-graded with good
clay binding, P for poorly graded but fairly clean, and M for poorly graded mixed with fi ner
materials. These symbols are used with group names GW, GP, GM, and GC in the grading of
gravels. The group symbols SW, SP, SM, and SC describe the grading nature of sands in the IS
classifi cation.
5.7.2 Fine-grained Soils
In fi ne-grained soils, more than 50 per cent of the particles by weight are silt and clay that pass
through the 75-micron sieve. The size of silt particles is 75 microns to 2 microns and that of
clay is less than 2 microns. The fi ne-grained soils are grouped under three subdivisions, namely
mixed silt and fi ne sands of inorganic nature, clay of inorganic type, and organic matter with
silty and clayey particles.
Compressibility of soil is also used in the classifi cation of fi ne-grained soils. The index for
compressibility is determined from the results of liquid limit tests as follows:
• Low plasticity—liquid limit of less than 35 represents silt and clay of low compressibility
expressed by the symbol L.
• Intermediate or medium plasticity—liquid limit between 35 and 50 indicates silt and clay of
medium compressibility designated by the symbol I.
• High plasticity—liquid limit more than 50 suggests high compressibility of silt and clay type
soil denoted by the symbol H.
In the IS classifi cation, the compressibility of fi ne-grained inorganic soils under different
subdivisions has been designated by the combination of symbols such as ML, MI, CL, and CI.
5.7.3 Organic Soils
Organic soils contain organic matter including peat (symbol PT) and decomposed vegetable
products in large quantities. Soils comprising materials such as shells and concretions in large
quantities are also included in this group. These soils have high compressibility. The symbols
OL, OI, and OH are used for organic soils of low, medium, and high plasticity, respectively.
The complete IS classifi cation of the different types of soils indicated by the different group
symbols is given in Table 5.2.
5.8 IDENTIFICATION OF DIFFERENT SOIL TYPES
The reason why it is so useful to identify different soil types is because each soil type has unique
hydrological properties. Some soil horizons (surface) will have high hydraulic conductivities
and thus have greater and more rapid fl uctuations in soil moisture. Some will have greater bulk
densities with lower effective porosities and thus have lower saturation values. Some will have
Chapter_05.indd 96 10/18/2012 5:03:00 PM
Soil Formation, Engineering Classifi cation, and Description of Indian Soils ● 97
clay fi lms that will retain water at fi eld capacity longer than other soil surfaces. Knowledge of
these different soil surfaces will allow the engineering geologist to construct a more complete
picture of the movement of water in the soil. In general, with increasing depth, the clay content
increases, the organic matter decreases, and the base saturation increases. Soil surfaces can be
identifi ed by colour, texture, structure, pH, and the visible appearance of clay fi lms.

5.8.1 Visual Observation to Identify Soil Types
Coarse-grained soil is identifi ed in a hand specimen with respect to its grain size, shape, grading,
and mineral contents. Spread over a fl at surface, the percentage of gravel, sand, and fi nes in a
soil can be roughly estimated from visual observation. Two charts, one made of glued particles
of gravel with 50 per cent particles of greater than 4.75 mm size and another for sand with
particle size 0.075–4.75 mm, help in the identifi cation of gravel and sand by comparison. A
hand lens (× 10) will facilitate viewing clearly the mineral content and the characteristic shape
of the grains such as angularity and roundness. The grading nature can be well understood with
practice from observing the different grain sizes in a sample.
Poorly graded soil particles (Fig. 5.11) are predominantly of one size (GP and SP types of
soil), whereas well-graded soil (Fig. 5.12) has a wide range in their particle size (GW and SW
types of soils). For accurate measurement of the percentage of gravel and sand in the soil, a
representative sample is taken in a graduated cylinder after mixing with water and allowed to
settle when gravel, sand, silt, and clay particles are deposited one above another in sequence of
coarseness to fi neness. The percentage by volume is measured from deposited gravel- to clay-
size particles in the cylinder. A substantial amount of clay-size particles mixed with gravel is
indicative of GC and SC types.
Fig. 5.11 Poorly graded soil with mostly Fig. 5.12 Well-graded soil with varied-size
single-size grains grains
Identifi cation of fi ne-grained soil is done by estimating its plasticity, dilatancy, and toughness.
Plasticity can be determined by rolling a small quantity of the soil on the palm to make threads of
approximately 3 mm diameter. In case the threads remain intact, the soil is of high plasticity, but if
cracks develop, it suggests a soil of low plasticity. Dilatancy is estimated by holding about 1 cm3
soil sample on the palm of one hand and shaking it with the help of the other hand. If moisture
beads are formed quickly on the surface, the soil type is inorganic fi ne sands, clayey fi ne sands,
or clayey silts, which are non-plastic in nature, such as ML and MI. However, when formation
of moisture beads is slow, the soil type is inorganic, organic silty, or clayey with medium-to-low
plasticity such as OL, OI, MH, and OH. No bead of water is formed in soils types such as inorganic
clays or silty clay with medium-to-high plasticity, that is, CI and CH. The toughness of the clay
is roughly estimated by taking a small quantity of wet soil and using hand pressure. Soil with
substantial clay, good plasticity, and no dilatancy possesses high toughness (that is, CH), but fi ne
sandy and silty soil with no plasticity but showing quick dilatancy has no toughness, that is, ML.

5.8.2 Additional Information Needed for Design Purposes
For engineering design purposes, the description of coarse-grained soils provided under
different divisions (Table 5.2) is substantiated by further information on stratifi cation, degree
of compaction, cementation, moisture content, and drainage characteristics from study of soils
in situ and in undisturbed conditions. Information on the percentage of gravel and sand, their
angularity, surface condition, hardness of coarse particles, and geological name of soils are
also obtained. The additional information required for fi ne-grained soils include structure,
stratifi cation, moisture content, consistency limit, and drainage conditions in undisturbed or
remoulded soils. From the studies of disturbed soils, information on colour in wet condition,
plasticity index, percentage of particles in different size grades, and geological names may also
be obtained.
5.9 CLAY MINERALS IN SOILS AND THEIR ENGINEERING SIGNIFICANCE
Clay minerals are an assemblage of crystalline minerals that provide plasticity and cohesion to
soil. A clayey soil, in addition to non-clay minerals such as quartz, feldspar, mica, and calcite,
may contain one or two clay minerals made of microscopically thin sheets. Chemically, the clay
minerals are composed of aluminium silicate or a combination of iron and magnesium silicate,
but some contain alkaline earth. Structurally, the clay minerals have two building blocks, one
having the confi guration of a tetrahedron and the other of an octahedron. The tetrahedral unit
contains a silica atom with four hydroxyls and the octahedral unit comprises an aluminium
atom and an iron, or a magnesium atom enclosed in six hydroxyls. The structural frameworks
of both the units are made up of densely packed sheets or layers.
5.9.1 Types of Clay Minerals
The three main groups of clay minerals commonly present in soil are montmorillonite, kaolinite,
and illite.
Montmorillonite
Montmorillonite is an expansive clay mineral of soil characterized by a sheet-like structure. An
octahedral gibbsite sheet packed between two silica sheets forms the structure of montmorillonite.
The swelling of this clay mineral is caused due to the bond of water inside the sheets. Each thin
sheet or platelet can attract to its fl at surface a layer of adsorbed water nearly 20 times larger
than the thickness of a sheet. Soil containing montmorillonite also shows high shrinkage in
addition to excessive swelling. This clay mineral may sometimes split into individual layers in the
presence of abundant water. The well-known bentonite usually originated from volcanic ash is a
montmorillonite clay utilized as drilling mud, which due to its expansive character prevents the
collapse of bore hole walls, but its presence in the foundation will have a very hazardous effect.
Kaolinite
Kaolinite is a non-swelling clay mineral formed from kaoline, the altered product of feldspar,
which is a basic mineral component of many rocks such as granite and pegmatite. Kaolinite
contains gibbsite and silicate sheets or layers in its structure. The successive layers are held together
fi rmly by hydrogen bonds providing a stable structure. Water cannot penetrate into the layered
structure. Hence, kaolinite when mixed with water does not show any appreciable swelling. The
fi ne sheets or platelets in its structure carry negative electromagnetic charges on their surfaces that
Chapter_05.indd 99 10/18/2012 5:03:00 PM
100 ● Engineering Geology
attract thick layers of adsorbed water producing good plasticity under wet conditions. China clay
is the common name of kaolinite, which is widely used in the pottery industry.
Illite
Illite is a non-expansive clay mineral. Its structure is similar to that of montmorillonite. However,
in illite, the silicates are replaced to a certain extent by aluminium in the tetrahedral layers and
potassium intrudes into the replaced part to tie the sheet-units together. Unlike kaolinite, the
illite crystals of a soil break easily into platelets comprising a gibbsite layer packed between
two silicate layers.
5.9.2 Sensitive Clay—Characteristics and Rectifi cation Measures
When a certain type of clay is remoulded, some disturbances are created in the structure of the
clay particles, which are then reoriented to nearly parallel arrangements. This causes reduction
in shearing resistance. Such type of clay sensitive to disturbances is called sensitive clay. This
clay acts normally when partly saturated but it yields to pressure forming a viscous fl ow. When
the clay is of highly sensitive type, it is known as quick clay. The degree of sensitivity (S) of a
t
type of clay is expressed by the ratio between the non-compacted compressive strength of an
undisturbed specimen and the strength of the same specimen at the same water content but in a
remoulded state. The value of S in sensitive clay is generally in the range 4–8 but may be 8–16
t
in clay of high sensitivity. In quick clay, natural water content is well above the liquid limit and
sensitivity S often exceeds 40 (Terzaghi Karl, 1968).
t
Quick clay is abundantly present in Scandinavian countries and in parts of Canada. If disturbed
by an earthquake tremor or a landslide, quick clay causes viscous fl ow destructing houses and
properties of the area containing such sensitive clay. The author of this book had the experience
of viewing landslide disturbances in parts of Norway where large segments of land with quick
clay layers move like viscous fl ow, carrying collapsed houses, inclined trees, and so on far away
from their original position. Research undertaken by Norwegian Geotechnical Institute (NGI)
has indicated that leaching of sodium salts from the soil due to glacial movement is responsible
for the formation of quick clay. The soil scientist in NGI demonstrates this with the help of this
simple experiment: Take a small lump of soil (quick clay) in a bowl and stir it with a spatula
until the soil becomes viscous and eventually appears like clayey water. Now spray some table
salt (sodium chloride) to this clayey water; it becomes solid and is not liquefi ed by disturbance.
This suggests that if sodium salt is taken out from the natural clay, it forms quick clay, and the
re-entry of the salt brings back its original form.
Earlier, any structure built in soil having a
quick clay layer faced the danger of collapse

cathode when positive ions move towards the cathode taking with them molecules of water.
This enforces inter-pore water to collect in the cathode areas and they are dragged by ion
charges. Thus, the process causes reduction in water content of the clay materials. In addition,
by suitable choice of the anodic electrode, a structural transformation of the clay can be induced
triggering a series of physicochemical reactions towards improving the stability of the quick
clay soil.
5.10 SOILS OF INDIA—CHARACTERISTICS AND OCCURRENCE
Large parts of India are covered by various types of soils found in the plains, valleys, and hill
slopes and even in the high-altitude mountainous terrains. The major soil types of India may be
classifi ed into the following groups:
• Alluvial soil
• Black soil
• Lateritic soil
• Red soil
In addition, considerable parts of the country are occupied by desert soil, forest soil,
and mountain soil. In certain parts, there are peaty, marshy, and saline types of soils too. A
description of all these soil types with respect to their formation, characteristics, and occurrence
is provided in the following subsections.
5.10.1 Alluvial Soil
Alluvial soil covers nearly 40 per cent of the land area of the country. The economy of the
country is dependent to a large extent on its alluvial soil. A large tract of India washed by the
rivers Indus, Ganga, and Brahmaputra extending from Assam to Punjab is covered by alluvial
soil and this is the richest source of fertile soil in the world. This soil is riverine soil transported
and deposited by the numerous rivers of the country. In addition to the alluvial tract of North
India, considerable parts of peninsular India including the coastal plains and river deltas also
contain alluvial soil. The Krishna, Cauvery, Godavari, and Narmada–Tapti river systems
washing a large landmass of South India have formed a very fertile alluvial soil.
Alluvial soils are also found nearly 30 m above the fl ood level of the streams belonging to
Sutlej, Yamuna, Ghagra, and other rivers of Indo-Gangetic plains. The northern alluvial tract
extends over many states—Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Orissa, West Bengal, and
Assam. In the peninsular region, the alluvial soil occurs in many of the river valleys and in the
east coast. The alluvial area also includes parts of Gujarat and deltaic soil in peninsular India.
Alluvial soil contains fi ne sediments of silt and clay. This soil also contains very small
humus and is defi cient in nitrogen but rich in potash. If the alluvial soil is of recent deposit, it
is called Khaddar; if it is of old alluvium, it is called Bhangar. If it contains sandy and gravelly
matters in large proportions, it is termed kankary. The Khaddar soils of newer alluvium are
pale brown in colour and non-porous, clayey, and loamy in composition. This soil is found in
the lower areas of valleys, being enriched every year by fl ood sediments. The Bhangar soils of
older alluvium are dark in colour containing a good percentage of nodules and shingles.
Though the alluvial soils differ in texture in different places, they are overall very fertile
and respond well to manures and irrigation for both rabi and kharif crops. These soils are well
suited for jute cultivation and also for the cultivation of rice, wheat, sugarcane, and oilseeds.

5.10.2 Black Soil
Black soil, also called black-cotton soil, is a typical Indian soil. This soil is locally known
as regur (equivalent to Russian Chernozem). The black-cotton soil is mainly the product of
in situ decomposition of the Deccan trap basalts. The colour of the soil varies from black
to chestnut brown. Its black colour is due to its iron content derived from the constituent
of basalt.
Black soil is mainly found over the Deccan trap areas including Maharashtra, Madhya
Pradesh, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, and parts of Tamil Nadu. The river valley areas of Narmada,
Tapti, Godavari, and Krishna also contain this soil. The total area covered by black soil is about
5.4 lakh km2, that is, about 16.6 per cent of the total land cover of the country.
Black soil occurs in areas of low (45–75 cm) rainfall. The soil develops conspicuous cracks
on drying. It is highly porous and swells enormously after wetting. Laboratory tests of black-
cotton soil indicated abnormal increase in expansive pressure when allowed to absorb water
continuously.
The following are the characteristics of black soil:
• It swells and becomes sticky when wet and shrinks when dried.
• During dry season, it develops wide cracks.
• The soil consists of high alumina, lime, and magnesia.
• It contains small potash, low nitrogen, and phosphorous and lacks organic matter.
• This soil is very good for cotton cultivation and hence the name.
• In addition to cotton, it is suitable for the growth of tobacco, sugarcane, and oil-seeds.
• Cereals such as rice, wheat, and jowar, citrus fruits, and vegetables are also grown in this soil.
• The moisture-retaining character of the soil makes it suitable for dry farming.
5.10.3 Lateritic Soil
Lateritic soil, another typical Indian soil, occurs as in situ deposits occupying the upper surface
of laterite. The soil is the decomposed product of laterite and is course textured, soft, and
friable. It is a porous soil because its silica content is removed from it by chemical action.
Lateritic soil is poor in lime and magnesia and defi cient in nitrogen.
The soil is formed under typical monsoon climate experiencing heavy rainfall and high
temperature with alternate dry and wet periods that allow leaching of silica and lime of the
parent rock. It is deep brown to red in colour due to the presence of iron oxide, which is formed
by the process of leaching. Due to leaching, the nutrients are percolated below the soil by heavy
rains, leaving the top soil impermeable. The soluble plant foods such as potash are also removed
from the top soil by leaching leaving alumina and iron oxide. This makes the soil less fertile.
There are two types of lateritic soil, namely upland laterite and lowland laterite. Upland
laterites are found over hills and upland areas. From there, they are transported by stream
towards the lowlands. Such transferred soils form lowland laterite, which is acidic in nature
as alkalis are leached away. Lowland laterite soil does not retain moisture and hence it is not
fertile. It is suitable only for special crops such as tapioca and cashew nuts. In general, lateritic
soil is poor in nitrogen minerals and is good for plantation of tea, coffee, coconut, rubber, and
even millet with the use of fertilizers.
This soil covers an area of nearly 2.4 lakh km2 of the country. The soil occurs in many parts
of India, especially in the Deccan traps of the peninsula and Khondalites of Orissa. It also
Chapter_05.indd 102 10/18/2012 5:03:01 PM
Soil Formation, Engineering Classifi cation, and Description of Indian Soils ● 103
occupies large areas of Western Ghats, Eastern Ghats, Rajmahal Hills, Maharashtra, Karnataka,
Kerala, and West Bengal.
5.10.4 Red Soil
Red soil is another important soil type of India. Large parts of the peninsular region, especially
the areas represented by gneisses and granites, are covered by red soil, which is produced by in
situ disintegration of these rocks. The soil is found as transported soil but occurs to very deeper
parts from the surface. The soil is coarse in the deeper part, medium in middle part, and fi ne at
the upper part in the delta regions.
The red colour is due to the wide diffusion of iron oxide through the soil material. This red
colour of the soil varies from very pale to deep depending upon the iron minerals present in the
parent rocks. The soil is defi cient in nitrogen, humus, and phosphorous but rich in potash. It
is a fertile soil and varies considerably in composition and characteristics depending upon the
constituent minerals of the parent rocks. This soil is suitable for cultivation of pulses, millets,
linseeds, tobacco, and so on.
This soil occupies an area of 3.5 lakh km2 area, which is about 10 per cent area of the
country. Red soil is prevalent in areas of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh,
Karnataka, Orissa, Bundelkhand, and Chota Nagpur plateau.
5.10.5 Other Soil Types
Other than the ones described in the previous subsections, there are some more soil types in
India.
Desert soil This type of soil prevails in the arid regions of Rajasthan, Haryana, and Punjab
where rainfall is less than 50 cm causing desert-like conditions. The soil is rich in sand particles
and contains high phosphorous but is low in nitrogen. Desert soil contains 90 per cent sand and
5 per cent clay. It also contains a rich percentage of soluble salts but lacks in organic matter.
This soil type covers approximately 2 lakh km2 of the dry areas of Punjab and Haryana. It is
made fertile by adding the defi cient minerals as fertilizers for cultivation purposes. Jowar,
bajra, maize, and cotton are mainly cultivated in desert soil.
Forest soil This type of soil is good for luxurious growth of several types of plants and
trees. It is found in mountain areas. Forest soil contains high organic content derived from
the decomposition of forest products and is very rich in humus but poor in potash, lime, and
phosphorous.
Mountain soil The high-altitude areas including the Himalayan terrain contain mountain
soils. This soil occurs as a thin deposit over the bedrock and is mostly infertile. It is quite prone
to soil erosion as it occurs on steep slopes and gets heavy rainfall.
Peaty and marshy soil This soil occurs in the humid climatic regions of Kerala, Uttar
Pradesh, Orissa, Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal containing large amounts of soluble salts and a
high percentage (10–49%) of organic matter.
Saline and alkali soils These soils contain high alkaline content impregnated by salt and are
available in parts of Punjab, Haryana, and Bihar. These soils are known as reh and kallar in
different local areas.

6.1 INTRODUCTION
Soil mechanics can be stated as the study of the properties, behaviour, and application
of soil consisting of an assemblage of fi ne rock particles and clay minerals. This
chapter discusses the various aspects of soil mechanics, the knowledge of which is
essential for geological as well as engineering works. It describes the procedures for
determining the index properties and Atterberg limits of soil by laboratory analyses.
The chapter also explains the method of determination of soil permeability by
pumping, which is the practical way of understanding the nature of water movement
through the subsurface soil mass and fractured rocks. It also elucidates with
illustrations the testing procedures of consolidation and compactness of soil and
further describes the different types of retaining structures used to arrest disruption
of soil slopes caused by earth pressure. The other aspects that are discussed in this
chapter are the methods of fi eld testing to measure the load-bearing capacity of soil
for evaluating designs for building foundation.
6.2 SOIL PHASES, COMPONENTS OF SOIL, AND SIZE OF SOIL
PARTICLES
The topmost part of the earth’s crust is composed of different types of soil. Geological
processes are responsible for the formation of these soil types as described in
Chapter 5. A mass of soil consists of solid particles of soil and void spaces that
occur between the soil particles generally fi lled with water, air, or gas. Naturally
occurring soil mass always consists of solid particles with water and air in the pore

To engineers, soils include all unconsolidated deposits with inorganic and/or organic material
consisting of grains and rock fragments of varying sizes. Evaluation of the properties of soil in
quantitative terms is required for the design of various engineering structures that are made of
soil or constructed on soil foundation and use soil as a building material.
6.2.1 Size Fractions of Soils
In order of decreasing size, the components of soils include boulder, cobble, gravel, sand, silt,
and clay. Table 6.1 provides a list of soil components classifi ed according to Indian Standards
(IS). The clay component in soil includes colloids. Colloids may be like jelly, called gel, or
like liquid, called sol. If some types of clay are subjected to vibration or sudden shocks, the gel
portion gets converted into sol, but after few hours it regains its original form of gel. This type
of clay is known as thixotropic clay.
Table 6.1 Size of soil components (IS 460–1962)
Component Passing through IS sieve Retained on IS sieve
Boulder (rock fragments) – 300 mm
Cobble (rock fragments) 300 mm 80 mm
Gravel (coarse grained) 80 mm 20 mm
Gravel (fi ne grained) 20 mm 4.75 mm
Sand (coarse grained) 4.75 mm 2.00 mm
Sand (medium grained) 2.00 mm 425 microns
Sand (fi ne grained) 425 microns 75 microns
Silt 75 microns 2 microns
Clay 2 microns –
The soils may be dry or saturated fully or partially with water. The voids in soils are
completely or partially fi lled with water and air. Soils consisting of gravels, coarse sands,
and medium dry sands called bulky particles are cohesionless, but silt- and clay-type soils
are cohesive. Wet sandy soils—especially with some clays or silts—are also cohesive. Being
derived from rock destruction, the bulky particles in soil are initially angular in shape, but the
Chapter_06.indd 107 10/18/2012 5:59:07 PM
108 ● Engineering Geology
geological process of erosion makes the sharp edges of the grains rounded and spherical shaped.
The variation in shapes of the particles also depends on soil minerals and their transportation
and depositional characteristics. Soils with fi ne-grained particles such as silt and clay are found
to have a dominant content of crystalline minerals. When the surface activity of the crystalline
minerals develops plasticity and cohesion, they are known as clay minerals. The clay minerals
in soil are found as an assemblage of book-like sheets or tubes.
6.2.2 Structure of Soils
The structure of a soil is the arrangement of the constituent particles in the soil matrix that
contains voids, fi ssures, and cracks. Soil structure depends on many factors such as shape,
size, mineral composition, orientation of the grains, the relation of soil water in their ionic
components, and the interactive forces among the particles. Since coarse-grained particles when
clean and dry do not possess plasticity and cohesion, soil containing these particles cannot form
stable structures. In moist sands, however, the contact pressure developed by capillary water
ring may provide the necessary bonding to create stable structures. However, when the grains
become dry, the structure again breaks down. Gravity and surface forces are the main forces
that play an active part on soil particles in developing the soil structure. Gravitational force is
operative only in soil containing coarse-grained particles. In small particles, surface forces are
effective in most of the soil types. These attractive forces are electrostatic in nature and are
popularly known as van der Waals’ forces. Repulsive surface forces also interact among the
particles to form layered structures. The different types of structures (Fig. 6.2) mainly observed
in soil developed by the depositional character and interactive forces of particles are described
in the following paragraphs.
Single-grain structure Grain-to-grain contact during deposition of predominantly coarse
particles (> 20 microns) in stream or lake water produces the single-grain structure. The
suspended grains settle in water under their own weight by gravitational force. The surface
forces of the particles do not play any role in attracting the grains. The deposition with particle-
to-particle contact may take place either in a loose state or in a dense state, and accordingly, the
void ratio of the soil with single-grain structure

are more if the dissolved materials remain in high
concentration in water as in marine water. Lambe (1953) is of the opinion that fl occulent structure
is developed by edge-to-edge contact of the colloidal platelets. An oriented or dispersed structure
will be formed if platelets come in contact with one another at the end faces.
Chapter_06.indd 108 10/18/2012 5:59:07 PM
Fundamentals of Soil Mechanics ● 109
Honeycomb structure Several single mineral grains in a soil bonded together by contact
forces form a honeycomb structure. When silt and clay particles (varying in size range between
0.2 microns and 20 microns) settle in water under gravity, the surface forces at the contact areas
of the particles may overcome the gravitational force to prevent their immediate settlement over
the already-deposited particles. These particles under settlement then come in close contact and
are held in position until miniature arches are formed over the void spaces to make honeycomb
structures. The types of soil that exhibit such structures possess high load-bearing capacity.
6.3 INDEX PROPERTIES OF SOILS AND THEIR LABORATORY DETERMINATION
The index properties of soils are those used in their proper identifi cation. They are divided
into two categories namely soil aggregate and soil grain properties. The soil aggregate
properties are related to the properties of the soil as a whole and not to its constituent grains.
The determination of the properties of soil as aggregate involves laboratory tests relating to
its water content and specifi c gravity, unit weight and density, porosity and void ratio, and
consistency limits. In addition, the fi eld test method of density is also included in the discussion
here.
The soil grain properties include the size and shape of the grains in soil. The size of soil
grains is measured by sieve analysis (also known as mechanical analysis) of dry soil. However,
when the grains are fi ne, the size is measured in a wet condition by sedimentation method
after dispersing the soil particles in water. The shape of the soil grains is known from their
characteristics such as angularity and roundness from visual observation of coarse grains or
microscopic examination of fi ne particles.
Test procedures for determination of index properties of soil are mentioned briefl y in the
following subsections conforming to the IS.
6.3.1 Water Content
The water content of a soil is the ratio of the weight of water to the weight of solids. The
common method of measuring the water content in a soil sample involves the following steps.
First, a small quantity (say, 10 g to 20 g) of moist soil is taken in a clean container after accurate
measurement (say, W ). The soil sample is then dried in an oven for 24 hours maintaining a
temperature of 100°C to 110°C and thereafter cooled in a desiccator. Then, the weight of the
cooled dry sample (W ) is taken. The difference of these two weights (W − W ) gives the weight
d d
of the water of the soil sample. The percentage of water content (w) of the sample is calculated
as follows:
W WW
w= d ×100 (6.1)

equal volume of s oil, both measured vat the same temperature (standard temperature 27°C).
A density bottle is generally used in the determination of specifi c gravity of soil. The weight
of the density bottle (W ) is fi rst taken. Then, the weight of the oven-dried sample (W ) is
1 2
measured after cooling in a desiccator. The difference of these two weights (W − W ) gives the

weight of the dry sample. The bottle with soil sample is then fi lled up with distilled water and

its weight (WWW ) taken. Hence, the weight of water in the bottle with the soil sample is (WWW −WWW ).
3 3 2
The material is taken out of the bottle and cleaned. The bottle is then fi lled with distilled water
and its weight (WW ) taken. The weight of water in the bottle without soil sample is (WW − WWW ).

Therefore, the specifi c gravity (G) of soil is obtained from the following relation:
g WWW WWW
G= ss = 2 1 (6.2)
ggg (WWW WWWW)(WWWW WWW )
w 44 11 33 22
6.3.3 Unit Weight
The unit weight of a soil mass is defi ned as its weight per unit volume. It is expressed as
kilonewtons per cubic metre (kN/m3) in the metric system. Unit weights are reported as dry unit
weight ggg or wet unit weight ggg .
dry wet
ggg =WW / V⋅(kN/m3)
dry dd
ggg =W / V⋅ (kN/m3)
wet s
Determination of unit weight in the laboratory involves taking the weight as well as the
volume of the sample. The volume of soil solids is obtained from the weight of the solids divided
by the specifi c gravity (G) of the solids (particles). To determine the volume of a cohesive
type of soil in the laboratory, the soil sample is cut into a regular shape such as cube, then
coated with paraffi n, and fi nally the volume is taken by the water replacement method. The unit
weight of soil solids (ggg) is the weight of the soil solids (WW ) per unit volume of the solids (V ).

Thus,
W
ggg = dd (6.3)
s V
ss
6.3.4 Density of Soil
The density of a soil is defi ned as the mass of the soil per unit volume. Density may be of
different types such as bulk density, dry density, saturated density, and submerged density.
Determination of density requires measurement of the weights and volumes of the soil sample
in the laboratory in different states such as dry, saturated, or submerged conditions depending
upon the type of the density to be determined. In metric system, density is expressed in g/cm3.
For calculation purposes, the unit weight of water is taken as 1 g/cm3.
The relation between unit weight (ggg) and density (gg) is expressed asgggg kN/m3=9.81gg g/cm3.
s s
Bulk density The bulk density (gg ) of soil is the weight per unit volume. If WW is the weight of
a soil sample andVVis the volume of the soil, the bulk density is expressed as
W
gg = (6.4)
V
Dry density The dry density of soil (ggg ) is the ratio of the weight (WW ) of the soil mass in dry
d d
condition (total weight of the particles) to its volume (V ) before drying. Thus,
WWW
ggg = d (6.5)
dd V
Chapter_06.indd 110 10/18/2012 5:59:08 PM

Saturated density The saturated density of a soil sample (g ) is the ratio of the weight of the saturated
sat
soil sample (W ) to the volume of the saturated sample (V ). The saturated density is expressed as
sat sat

g = sat (6.6)

Submerged density The submerged density (g ′) is the ratio of submerged weight of the soil
solids (W ) to the volume (V ) of the soil mass and is given by the expression
d sub

g ′ = d sub (6.7)

6.3.5 Porosity
Porosity of the soil is the ratio of volume of voids (V) to the total volume (V ) of the soil mass.
v
Similar to rocks, it is also designated by the symbol n and is expressed as
VVV
n = v (6.8)

6.3.6 Void Ratio
Void ratio (e) of a soil sample is the ratio of the volume of voids (V) to the volume of the solid
v
mater (V) in that soil mass and given by the expression
s
VVV
e = v (6.9)
VVV
s
6.3.7 Relation Between Porosity and Void Ratio
If porosity is expressed as a percentage, it is referred to as the percentage of voids. According
to Eq. (6.8), if the volume of voids in a soil mass is taken as n, then the volume of soil mass
becomes equal to 1. Then we have 1− n as the total volume of the soil solids. So, the void ratio
of Eq. (6.9) can be expressed as
VVV ⎛⎛⎛ n ⎞⎞⎞
e = v = n⎜ ⎟ (6.10)
VVV ⎝⎝⎝ 1−n⎠⎠⎠
s
Similarly, if the volume of the voids is taken as e, the volume of the soil solids according to
Eq. (6.9) becomes 1 and the total volume of soil mass would be 1 + e. So, the porosity, given
by Eq. (6.8), can be expressed as
VVV e
n = v = (6.11)
V 1+e
The size, shape, and nature of packing of the particles decide the void spaces in the soil mass.
The degree of saturation of the soil voids depends upon the ratio of voids fi lled with water to
the total volume of voids. A soil mass is said to be fully saturated if all the voids are fi lled with
water. In a partially saturated soil voids, the rest of the voids are fi lled with air.
6.4 CONSISTENCY LIMITS (ATTERBERG LIMITS) AND THEIR DETERMINATION
The consistency of a soil refers to its stiffness or fi rmness that depends upon the water content of
the soil. The stiffness decreases and soil loses its cohesion with increasing water. With gradual
increase in water, the cohesion is reduced to such an extent that the soil mass no longer retains
its shape and fl ows as a liquid. However, if the soil is allowed to dry, it regains its shearing
strength and stiffness. While drying up, the soil mass passes through four states of consistency
namely liquid, plastic, semi-solid, and solid states. The arbitrary limits set for these states in

terms of water content at which the soil mass changes from one state to the next are called the
consistency limits or Atterberg limits. These limits include liquid limit (L ), plastic limit (P ),
w w
and shrinkage limit (S ) and are of signifi cance in the engineering use of soils. Plastic limit is
w
used in soil classifi cation. Soils of particle size less than 425 microns are taken for conducting
all tests for laboratory determination of Atterberg limits.
Liquid limit (L )
w
At the liquid limit state, the water content is such that it still possesses a small shearing strength
against fl owing. The liquid limit is measured in a standard liquid testing apparatus that consists
of a brass cup seated on a rubber base and provided with a handle that can be raised or dropped
from a standard height, see Fig. 6.3(a). About 120 g of soil is mixed with water to make a cake.
The cake is kept in the brass cup making a ‘V’-shaped separation such that the gap between
them is 2 mm at the bottom and 10 mm at the top and 8 mm in depth, as shown in Fig. 6.3(b).
Strokes are then given to the cup by rotating the handle until the two parts touch each other,
see Fig. 6.3(c). At this stage, the number of strokes used is noted and a soil sample wis taken
from the cake and its water content measured. Tests are repeated with different water contents
such that the number of strokes required remains between 15 and 50. At least four such tests are
done, each time recording the number of strokes and the corresponding water content of the soil
mass. A graph prepared from the four records for water content versus number of strokes gives
the L value, which is equal to the water content for 25 strokes, see Fig. 6.3(d).

Plastic limit (P )

It is the minimum water content at which the soil when rolled into
threads of 3 mm diameter just starts crumbling. Nearly 20 g of air-
Cracks
dried soil is mixed with water until it becomes plastic in nature. A
small quantity (say, 8 g) of this soil is rolled on a glass plate to make
a thread of uniform diameter of about 3 mm for the entire length.
3 mm
If no cracks are developed in it, the thread is kneaded together
and the soil is rolled again. The process is continued until fi ne
cracks just start developing on the surface of the threads (Fig. 6.4).
Fig. 6.4 Determination of plastic
limit (P ) At this point, the water content of the soil is measured which gives
w
the plastic limit of the soil. The average result of at least three tests should be taken. Plasticity index
is deduced from the difference in values of liquid limit and plastic limit. Thus, plasticity index
I = L − P . In case of sandy soil, which is not plastic in nature, plasticity index cannot be deduced.
w w w
Shrinkage limit (S )
w
If a saturated soil sample with water content more than the shrinkage limit is allowed to dry up
slowly, its volume will be gradually reduced. However, at a certain stage, further reduction in
water will not change the volume of the soil sample, the pore spaces being fi lled with air. The
water content corresponding to this stage is the measure of the shrinkage limit. To determine the
shrinkage limit, a wet soil sample (Fig. 6.5) is taken in a dish and its weight W is measured by
1
subtracting the weight of empty dish from that of the dish plus soil. The volume of the sample
is obtained by mercury replacement method, which involves immersing the dry sample in a
container fi lled with mercury and then measuring the overfl ow portion of mercury. The volume
V is computed by dividing the weight (g) of displaced mercury by the density of mercury (13.6
1
g/cm3). Let at the state of shrinkage limit the volume attained by the soil sample be V (Fig. 6.5).

The dry weight (W ) and the corresponding dry volume (V ) of the soil sample are determined.

6.5 FIELD METHOD OF DENSITY DETERMINATION
The fi eld measurement of fi ll or natural soil is important in engineering constructions. The
test of density on fi ll indicates whether it has attained compaction to the extent required by the
design. Field test of density on soil is conducted in borrow areas to determine its suitability for
construction of earthen structures. The methods commonly followed in the fi eld density test
include water displacement method, sand replacement method, core cutting method, and rubber
balloon method. These methods are described in the following subsections.

6.5.1 Water Displacement Method
A soil specimen of regular shape is collected from the fi eld by a core cutter. It is then coated with
paraffi n wax to make it impervious to water. The total volume (V) of the waxed specimen is
1
found by determining the volume of the specimen. The volume of the specimen (V ) is given by
V = V − (M − M)/P
1 t p
Here, M is the mass of waxed solid, M is the mass of the specimen without wax, and
t
P is the density of paraffi n.
p
Dry density of specimen = (M/V)/(1+ w)
Here, w is the water content.
6.5.2 Sand Replacement Method
The apparatus needed for the sand replacement method consists of a calibrated container, soil
cutter chisel, balance, tray, and a sand pouring cylinder fi tted above a sand pouring cone with a
shutter. Dry and clean sand particles of size ranging between 600 micron and 300 micron are used
in the cylinder. First, a fl at ground of soil is chosen for conducting the test. Soil is then excavated
from the place with the help of the chisel by making a test hole about the size of the calibrated
container. The weight of the excavated soil is taken (W ). Next, the cylinder is fi lled with sand
and the weight of the cylinder plus sand is measured (W). The sand from the cylinder is then
1
run into the calibrated container so that the volume of the sand is equal to that of the container
(V). The sand-fi lled cylinder is then placed over the calibrated cone and the sand is allowed to
pour, until it stops falling when the shutter is closed and the sand in the cone is collected and its
weight (W) taken. The cylinder is then placed over the container and the sand is allowed to pour
2
until no further sand runs down. The weight (W) of the cylinder with sand is taken. The cylinder
3
fi lled with sand is then placed over the excavated hole until it fi lls the hole. The cylinder with
the remaining sand is weighed (W). Thus, we have the volume of the calibrating container V.

If W ′ is the weight of sand needed to fi ll the calibrated container, then W′ = W − W − W .

6.5.3 Core Cutter Method
In core cutter method of density determination of soil in the fi eld, a cylindrical core cutter is
inserted into a clean soil surface and a cylindrical soil sample having the same volume (V in cm3)
as the cylindrical soil cutter is obtained. First, the weight of the cutter plus soil is taken. Second, the
weight of only the cutter is noted. The difference of the two readings gives the weight of the soil
sample (W in g). Next, the water content (w) of the excavated soil is determined in the laboratory.
W g
Thus, the bulk density of soil g = g g/cm3 and the dry density g = g g/cm3.

6.5.4 Rubber Balloon Method
The apparatus of the balloon cone method of testing of soil includes a water-fi lled vertical
cylinder having a bottom opening over which a rubber membrane or balloon is stretched.
The cylinder is so graduated that water levels are visible to read the volumes. A small hand pump
Chapter_06.indd 114 10/18/2012 5:59:10 PM
Fundamentals of Soil Mechanics ● 115
is attached so that air can be forced into the top of the cylinder. When a specimen is placed over
a test hole (for test measurement), the pumped air forces the balloon and water into the hole.
A typical hole is 100 mm in diameter and is 100 m deep.
The volume is determined directly by noting the water level in the cylinder before (initial)
and after (fi nal) the balloon is forced into the test hole. This difference in volume (fi nal − initial
volumes) is the volume of the hole. The water and balloon are retracted from the test hole by
reversing the air pump and evacuating air from the cylinder. The outside atmospheric pressure
forces the water and balloon back into the cylinder. The soil is removed from the test hole and
its wet and dry weights are recorded. Then, similar to the sand cone method, the volume of
the test hole and the weights (wet and dry) of the soil being known, the in situ bulk and dry
densities of the soil can be calculated (see Section 6.5.2).
6.6 SIZE AND SHAPE OF SOIL PARTICLES
The size of the soil particles is determined by mechanical analysis, that is, the method of
separation of particles into different size fractions by means of standard sieves. The IS sieve
numbers are designated in millimetres and microns and the corresponding size of the openings
(apertures) in millimetres. The American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) sieve numbers
are based on the number of meshes (openings) per inch at the sieve bottom and the apertures
are in millimetres (Table 6.2).

6.6.1 Mechanical Analysis for Size Fractions
Mechanical analysis of soil sample is conducted in two parts. First, the particles of coarse-
grained soil (above 75 microns) are separated into size fractions using standard sieves. Next,
the particles of fi ne-grained soil (less than 75 microns) are separated into size fraction following
sedimentation method (wet analysis). For sieve analysis, a set of sieves is arranged with the
75-micron sieve at the bottom and larger aperture sieves above it one after another in order
of increasing mesh openings. A cover is always kept over the largest aperture sieve and a pan
(receiver) under the bottom sieve to collect the particles passing through it. An electric shaker
is used to shake the set of sieves for 15 minutes.
If the soil contains gravel-size particles, the IS 100 mm sieve is placed at the top followed
by, say, 63 mm, 50 mm, 20 mm, 10 mm, and 4.75 mm sieves towards the bottom. For sand-size
particles, the 4.75 mm sieve is placed at the top followed by the other sieves towards the bottom
in the following order: sieve numbers 4.00 mm, 2.00 mm, 1.00 mm, 500 microns, 300 microns,
180 microns, 125 microns, and 75 microns. The weights of the individual fractions indicated by
the ‘passing through’ sieves are noted. The percentage of each fraction is then calculated from
the total weight of all the fractions passing through the set of sieves. The weight of the fraction
in the pan is also to be noted and added to get the total weight of the sieved sample.
6.6.2 Wet Analysis (Sedimentation Method)
Today, there are sophisticated automatic instruments for measuring the size of fi ne-grained
particles under wet condition. Computerized automatic size measuring instruments for particles
based on laser beam techniques are used in the geotechnical laboratories of Geological Survey of
India. The sedimentation method is undertaken in particles of fi ne-grained soil (< 75 microns).
It requires a graduated cylinder and a pipette or a hydrometer. The method involves mixing
suitable amount of the soil (W g) with a liquid (generally water) to make a known volume of the
mix (say, V ) in a graduated cylinder. The mix (soil and liquid) is agitated so that the particles
remain in suspension. With the help of a pipette, a sample of the mix is drawn from a fi xed
height (h cm) after any time interval (t minutes). If the diameter D of the particles drawn have
weight w, then the weight percentage (n) is given by
w
n= ×100 (6.15)
W/VVV
For different diameter (D) values, there will be different weight percentage (n) values. The
D values are determined using Stokes’ law. The settling velocity (v) of the material obeys Stokes’
law, which is based on the shape, weight, and size of the particles. According to this law, the
relatively coarser particles will settle fi rst followed by relatively fi ner grains. In Eq. (6.16)
derived from Stokes’ law, it is assumed that the particles are spherical in shape and all have the
same specifi c gravity (G). Using water (viscosity h) as the liquid medium for suspension, it can
Chapter_06.indd 116 10/18/2012 5:59:11 PM

be deduced that the settling velocity (v) and particle diameter (D) falling from a height of h cm
in t minutes have the following relationship:

The values of M for different values of specifi c gravity (G) with viscosity of water (h) at different
temperatures (°C) are obtained from the standard table. So, the different size (D) values and the
corresponding weight per cent (n) values are obtained from Eqs (6.18) and (6.15), respectively.
6.6.3 Size Distribution Curve of Soil Particles
The data obtained from the size analyses of soil particles is plotted on a logarithmic graph
paper to obtain the size distribution curves, which are also known as cumulative curves. The
particle size (in millimetres) is plotted as the abscissa and the percentage of particles ‘fi ner
than’ by weight as the ordinate (Fig. 6.6). The nature of the curves clearly brings out the soil
characteristics including the coarseness or fi neness of the soil particles, uniformity of the grain
size, and the nature of gradation. For example, a soil becomes well graded (curve c, Fig. 6.6)
when fi ne particles fi ll the voids among the coarse particles. As such, well-graded soil will
have a mixture of fi ne and coarse particles and minimum void space. In poorly graded soil or
uniformly graded soil (curve e, Fig. 6.6), the particles of the same size occur in dominance over
the other or grains of certain range may be nearly or completely absent.

The value of C lies between one and three in well-graded soil. In addition, C must be more

than six in well-graded sands and more than four in well-graded gravels. The estimated C and
g
C values of the sandy soil (curve c, Fig. 6.6) are 1.8 and 20, respectively, and as such it is a
u
well-graded sand or sandy soil.
6.6.4 Shape (Angularity and Roundness) of Soil Particles
Angularity and roundness of coarse soil particles (gravel and sand) depend upon the nature of the
soil deposit as well as the mineral constituents. Residual soil deposits consisting of rock fragments,
gravels, and coarse sand are mostly angular in shape. However, in transported soil, when water acts
as the transporting agent (i.e., alluvial deposits), the grains become rounded due to abrasion and
rolling. The particles of transported soil of river origin may be subrounded to angular if the place
of origin is nearby as the degree of wear is less. Beach sands are also rounded due to the abrading
action of the particles under movement by waves. Marine sand (soil formed of deposits in marine
water) is, however, mostly angular. The ice-worn coarse sands are mostly fl at and generally angular.
The Aeolian (wind-blown) sands are fi ne grained but rounded. In the fi ne-grained soil, there are
abundant scale-like and fl ake-shaped minerals such as micas. These fi ne-grained minerals, if soft
in nature, are subjected to further breakage and become fi ner but retain their fl aky shape.
6.7 SWELLING CLAY AND ITS EXPANSIVE CHARACTERISTIC
Certain types of soil, especially clayey soil, when soaked with water may increase in volume. This
characteristic is essentially due to the presence of swelling type of clay-like montmorillonite,
which can hold a large quantity of water and then swell many times its volume. In fact, this clay
mineral has a high absorbing capacity of water that increases its volume.
6.7.1 Laboratory Test for Swelling Coeffi cient
Swelling or expansion characteristic of clayey soil or clay is related to its plasticity. Clay with
plasticity index above 35 is found to have high swelling. Whether a clay sample is of swelling
type or not is determined by a simple test in the laboratory. The clayey soil collected from the
fi eld is sieved in a 45 micron sieve. The portion of fi nes (clay) that remains in the pan below
the 45 micron sieve is collected. Then, a measured quantity (say, 10 ml to 20 ml) of this clay
sample is taken in a graduated cylinder and dispersed in 1,000 ml water. The water-mixed
clay sample in the cylinder is kept undisturbed for 24 hours to fi nd the change in volume. Any
observed increase in volume indicates that the clay is of swelling type. The percentage increase
in volume with respect to the original volume is the measure of swelling.
Chapter_06.indd 118 10/18/2012 5:59:12 PM
Fundamentals of Soil Mechanics ● 119
If L is the original volume of the sample inside the cylinder and L′ is the volume of the
sample after swelling, the swelling coeffi cient is expressed as
S = (L′− L)/L × 100
6.7.2 Measurement of Expansion Pressure
The pressure exerted by expansion of swelling type of clayey soil or clay can be measured in a
consolidometer or proving ring apparatus. The specimen of soil is compacted in a Proctor mould
and then cut into the size of the cell in which it is to be placed for the test. The cell of the fi xed
type of consolidometer contains two porous stones, the lower one being fi xed and the upper one
movable (see Section 6.8). The specimen is allowed to soak in water. As the specimen starts
to swell, a very small increase in expansion in volume is subjected to load until it comes to its
original position. The load is applied by operating the spindle of the proving ring apparatus or
the trolley head of the consolidometer. A curve is plotted for the swelling percentage versus
applied load (in tonnes) from the results of three such tests. This helps to understand the soil
behaviour under different loads. The moisture content and the density of the specimen are
measured before and after the test. This helps to determine the moisture content and density at
which the expansion will be minimum. In practice, the expansion pressure can be reduced by
the use of a layer of non-expansive material overlying the swelling clay in foundations.
6.8 SOIL PERMEABILITY
Permeability of a soil is defi ned as the capacity of the soil to allow fl ow of water through its
voids. When a porous media such as sand permits water to pass through the interconnected
voids or pore spaces, it is called permeable. However, clay, though highly porous, is said to
be impermeable as the voids are not interconnected and as such water cannot pass through it.
Movement of water through soil exerts pressure known as seepage pressure. Permeability of
soil is of importance in the study of groundwater fl ow through wells, seepage through the body
of earth dams, piping of hydraulic structures and safety measures, and drainage and associated
problems related to the stability of soil slopes.
6.8.1 Flow Characteristics and Darcy’s Law
The fl ow characteristic of water through a soil mass is illustrated in Fig. 6.7. Water entering
in pervious soil travels along smooth curves known as fl ow line. If the lines are parallel, the

120 ● Engineering Geology
fl ow is said to be linear fl ow. If the fl ow follows a defi nite path, it is called laminar fl ow, but if
the fl ow paths are irregular and cross at random, it is known as turbulent fl ow, see Fig. 6.7(a).
The water levels in the two tubes inserted in a water-bearing soil rise to a height of h and h
1 2
known as piezometric heads. The difference in the piezometric heads (h − h ) between the two
1 2
is known as the hydraulic head (h). The ratio of hydraulic heads to the distance (L) between the
two points is known as the hydraulic gradient, i. Thus, i = h/L , see Fig. 6.7(b).
Permeability of a soil is measured by the coeffi cient of permeability, which varies depending
on the type of soil. The greater the coeffi cient of permeability, the more permeable is the
material. In laminar or non-turbulent fl ow conditions, the permeability of soil obeys Darcy’s
law, which states that the rate of fl ow is proportional to the hydraulic gradient. Thus,
v = ki (6.21)
q
Darcy’s law can also be expressed as q = kia = va, or v = (6.22)
a
where v is the velocity of fl ow, i is the hydraulic gradient, k is Darcy’s coeffi cient of
permeability, q is the discharge per unit time, and a is the cross-sectional area of soil mass
normal to fl ow direction.
Thus, coeffi cient of permeability (or simply, permeability) is the average velocity of fl ow
through the total cross-sectional area of soil mass under unit hydraulic gradient. Permeability is
dependent on various factors such as the size and shape of the soil particles, nature of fl uids that
fl ow through the pores, void ratio of soil mass, adsorbed water in soil, structural arrangement
of the particles, and presence of organic matter and other admixtures.
6.8.2 Laboratory Determination of Soil Permeability
Coeffi cient of permeability is determined in the laboratory by constant head method for
coarse-grained soil, which is generally very permeable, and by falling head method for fi ne-
grained soil, which is less permeable. The apparatus used in the permeability test is known as
permeameter. In both the methods, the permeameters used allow fl ow of water through the soil
and establish a hydraulic gradient within the sample. In the constant head method, see Fig. 6.8
(a) when the steady state of fl ow is obtained, the quantity of fl ow (Q in ml) is recorded from

the measurement of the water collected in the bottom vessel and the time (t in seconds) taken
for this quantity of water fl ow in the vessel is noted. If L is the height of the specimen, gradient
i = h/L. The values of specimen height L (cm), its cross-sectional area a (cm2 ), and the head of
water h (cm) being known, the coeffi cient of permeability k (cm/s) can be computed. According
to Darcy’s law, we have
q = Q/t = kia

The apparatus for measuring permeability by falling head method consists of a standpipe
(cross-sectional area a cm2) through which water can be allowed to fl ow down to the soil
p
sample, see Fig. 6.8(b). The head of water is measured from the difference of water levels
between the standpipe and the bottom tank. When the steady state of fl ow is attained, the head h
1
at the time instant t is recorded. After an interval of time, height h and the corresponding time t
1 2 2
are again noted (when t < t ). Now, consider the head h at any intermediate time interval t. Then,
1 2
the coeffi cient of permeability k is computed following Darcy’s law on the basis of the change in
head (in cm) in a small time (in seconds) interval. The height L (cm) and cross-sectional area of
the sample a (cm2) being known, the coeffi cient of permeability k cm/s is computed as follows:

Source of errors in laboratory test for permeability Several types of errors could affect the
determination of permeability by laboratory test. The air trapped in the sample may prevent it
from getting fully saturated. The soil sample is also disturbed by fl owing water, a portion of soil
being washed away from the sample during the test. Formation of fi lter skin of fi ne materials
on the surface of the sample and segregation of air in the form of bubbles within the sample are
other sources of error. The most important factor is that the soil sample used for the laboratory
test is not truly representative of the fi eld condition, and as such, determination of coeffi cient of
permeability of soil by fi eld test (pumping test) is favoured.
6.8.3 Determination of Field Permeability of Soil by Pumping Test
Unlike the laboratory test, the result of the fi eld permeability test of soil represents the overall
permeability of the soil covering a large area. According to Terzaghi and Peck (1967, a reliable
value of permeability can be obtained by pumping test through a test well and selected number
of observation wells, see Figs 6.9(a) and (b). Permeability is determined by pumping water from
the test well. Initial ground water levels in the wells are observed in all the holes for a suffi cient
time to fi nd the nature of fl uctuation. Pumping is started at a uniform rate of discharge (Q)
until equilibrium position is reached. Initially, the ground water level remains horizontal, but
on continuing the pumping, the water level descends creating a cone of depression. The rate of
descend in levels (drawdown) corresponding to a steady discharge is recorded. For the confi ned
aquifer shown in Fig. 6.9(a) the value of permeability k is calculated from the following equation:

are the corresponding radial distances from the test well. It has been assumed that the fl ow is
laminar, the aquifer homogeneous, and fl ow of water uniform in nature throughout the aquifer.
It is also assumed that the velocity of fl ow of water is proportional to the hydraulic gradient
and the wells penetrate to the entire depths of pervious strata through which water fl ows to
the wells. The degree of permeability varies widely depending upon the type of soil or the
unconsolidated material through which water fl ows. It is high in clean gravel, medium in coarse
sand, low in fi ne sand or silt, and very low to practically nil in clay.
6.9 CONSOLIDATION OF SOIL
A thick deposit of clay compressed by the load of superincumbent materials through geologic
time gets hardened with reduction in volume and becomes shale. In a similar way, when a
saturated and compressible soil (such as clay) is kept under static load for a long time, its volume
decreases due to compression. The compressive load squeezes the pore fl uids and reduces the pore
spaces causing an overall reduction of the volume of the soil mass. Such process of compression
resulted from long-time loading to cause decrease in soil volume is termed consolidation.
Compression of clay under increase in pressure proceeds very slowly as the permeability of
clay is very low. In consolidation at constant load, the decrease in water content is caused by
the gradual adjustment of soil particles and thus reduction in volume is slow. After the initial or
primary stage of consolidation, increment in load causes excess pore water pressure or hydrostatic
pressure because of which water gradually escapes from the voids. The increment of pressure
causes increase in effective pressure on soil solids and the volume of the soil mass gradually
Chapter_06.indd 122 10/18/2012 5:59:14 PM
Fundamentals of Soil Mechanics ● 123
decreases. At the end of the primary consolidation stage, the effective pressure (also called
consolidation pressure) in the soil mass ceases and no further drain of water occurs and a condition
of equilibrium comes into existence. The void ratio changes according to the varied consolidation
pressures.
The primary consolidation that decreases the soil volume is attributed principally to the
decrease in void spaces between soil particles. In primary consolidation, compression refers to
the processes where particles in the stressed zone are rearranged into a more compact or tighter
confi guration as void water is squeezed out. Secondary compression is the additional compression
that occurs at a constant value of effective stress after excess pore water has been dissipated.
6.9.1 Laboratory Test of Consolidation
In the laboratory, consolidation test is conducted using a consolidometer that consists of a loading
frame and a consolidation cell in which the specimen is placed between two porous stones
(Fig. 6.10). The porous stones enable the squeezing out of water from the sample during testing.
Both the porous stones placed at the two ends of the specimen take part in the compression
of the specimen. (In the fi xed ring type cell, only the top porous stone moves down when the
specimen is subjected to vertical pressure [compression].) To start with, an initial pressure,
say, 0.1 kg/cm2, is applied, which is gradually increased to 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, and fi nally
10 kg/cm2. For each increase in pressure, the compression is read out from the dial gauge fi tted
with the machine at intervals of 0.25, 1.0, 2.5, 4, 6, 9, 12, 20, 25, 36, 49, and 60 minutes, and then
2, 4, 8, and 24 hours. After the completion of consolidation by applying the maximum pressure,
the specimen is removed and the weights of the soil solids and the water content are determined.
The dial gauge reading for rebound after removal of the pressure (after at least 24 hours) is also
recorded. The test data is used to calculate the void ratio and the coeffi cient of volume change.

6.9.2 Calculation of Void Ratio and Coeffi cient of Volume Change
Void ratio can be calculated by two methods namely the height of solids method and the change
in void ratio method.
Height of solids method
Let the diameter of the soil specimen be a, the weight of the dry specimen W , and the specifi c
d
gravity of the soil G. Then, the height (H) of the soil solids is calculated from the following
s
expression:
WW
H = d (6.27)
s Ga
Chapter_06.indd 123 10/18/2012 5:59:15 PM
124 ● Engineering Geology
The void ratio is calculated from the relation:
H H
e= s (6.28)
H
s
where, H is the specimen height at equilibrium under various applied pressures. This is given
by the relation
H = H + ΣΔH = H + ΔH
0 1
Here, H is the initial height of the specimen, H is the height of the specimen at the beginning
0 1
of the load increment, and ΔH is the change in the thickness of the specimen for each pressure
increment.
The value (H) of dry soil specimen is obtained from Eq. (6.27) using the specifi c gravity,
s
dry weight, and diameter of the soil specimen measured in the laboratory. The pressure
increment and the corresponding change in height are noted in a tabulated form from the dial
gauge readings of the consolidation test, which will give the value of H for different pressure
increments (H = H ± ΔH). As the values of H and H are known, the void ratio, e, can be
1 s
computed from Eq. (6.28).
Change in void ratio method
In the case of completely saturated soil, the fi nal void ratio (e) at the end of the test is estimated
f
from the relation:
e = w G (6.29)
f f
Here, G is the specifi c gravity and w is the fi nal water content at the end of the test. The change
f
in void ratio Δe under each pressure increment can be computed from the following relationship:
Δ ΔΔΔH ΔΔΔH( e )
e = or Δe = ff (6.30)
1+e H H
f
where H is the fi nal height attained by the specimen at the end of the test. The consolidation
f
test in the laboratory provides data on change in thickness (ΔH ) of soil from the void ratio at
the beginning of the test (e) and at the end of the test (e ) by computations based on Eq. (6.30).
f
The change in void ratio (Δe) can be calculated from the specimen height (H ) and the change in
thickness (ΔH ). Knowing Δe and e, the equilibrium void ratio corresponding to each pressure can
f
be estimated.
Curve showing pressure and void ratio relation
The data on consolidation test is plotted on a graph paper taking the increment of pressure ( p)
as abscissa and the corresponding void ratio (e) as ordinate to obtain the virgin compressive
curve, shown in Fig. 6.11(a). When plotted on a semi-logarithmic paper, the virgin compression
curve is obtained as a straight line, see Fig. 6.11(b) which can be expressed by the empirical
relationship given by Terzaghi 1967 as follows:
e = e − Clog d ′/d ′
0 c 10 0
Here, e is the initial void ratio at initial pressure d ′, e is the void ratio at increased pressure
0 0
d′, and C is the corresponding index.

The theory of consolidation is complex in nature and a textbook on soil mechanics (Soil
Mechanics in Engineering Practice, Karl Terzaghi, Ralph Brazelton Peck Wiley, 1967 on this
aspect may be thoroughly studied before using it to solve practical problems.

6.10 SOIL COMPACTION
Compression of soil accomplished by loading for a short period is known as compaction. It is a
quick process of densifi cation and stabilization of soil. A soil mass loses its compactness when it is
excavated from its natural source and deposited elsewhere. As such, the soil of borrow areas brought
for construction of earth-fi ll structures requires to be compacted. Compaction is a process by which
the soil particles are rearranged and closely packed, thus resulting in a decrease in the void ratio and
an increase in density. The extent of densifi cation of soil is dependent on the amount of compaction.
Increase of compaction leads to an increase in dry density and a decrease in water content.
6.10.1 Process of Compaction
Soil from the borrow areas is deposited at the earthwork site where it is compacted by rollers or
other machineries until the desired result with respect to density and water content is achieved.
In general, if the soil is very dry it is sprinkled with water before compaction to make it wet to
obtain the desired compaction. Alternatively, if the soil is wet, it is piled near the construction
site to allow it to dry and reduce the water content before its placement at the site for compaction.
Laboratory test is conducted on the compacted soil of the work site to check whether the water
content and density have achieved the compaction as per design requirement. It has been found
that soil achieves the highest compaction and maximum density with a specifi c water content
termed as optimum water content.
6.10.2 Compaction Machineries and Their Performance
Compaction of soil in earthwork sites utilizes mainly three types of compaction equipment,
namely rollers, rammers, and vibrators. Rollers may be of several varieties such as the pneumatic
tyred rollers, smooth wheel rollers, and sheep-foot rollers. Rammers used in fi eld compaction
of soil may be pneumatic or internal combustion types. Vibrators comprise vibrating units of
pulsating hydraulic types moulded on rollers or plates, or out-of-balance weight types.
Performances of the equipment as regards compaction depends on several factors such as
the nature of soil including the grain size, water content, nature of admixture, and the degree
of compaction. Compaction increases the dry density but the extent of increase depends upon
the type of soil. Coarse-grained and well-graded soils attain maximum dry density with lower
Chapter_06.indd 125 10/18/2012 5:59:16 PM
126 ● Engineering Geology
optimum water content after compaction in comparison to fi ne-grained soil that requires more
compaction and more water to attain the maximum dry density. The compaction property is
changed when organic matters or other admixtures are present in the soil. Sometimes admixtures
are added to achieve the desired extent of compaction.
In general, the effect of compaction on soil particles depends on their compressibility, pore
pressure, permeability, stress–strain relation, shrinkage, and swelling.
Compaction of cohesionless soil
The method of compaction of cohesionless soils such as gravels and sands includes a combination
of operations namely vibration, watering, and rolling. The method of tamping by heavy weights
was mostly followed in earlier days, but today, compaction is done by machine vibration. In
a rock-fi ll dam that mostly uses coarse materials such as cobbles, gravels, and sands, heavy
rollers are used for compaction of these fi ll materials after spreading them in layers of 20 cm
to 30 cm thickness. Most fi lls are compacted by pneumatic tyred rollers. It may be required to
add water during compaction to eliminate the capillary forces in soil grains. In clear sand, water
drains out easily and compaction may not be effective to the desired extent.
Compaction of cohesive soil
In cohesive soils such as clayey silt or in admixture of gravel–sand–silt–clay, compaction can
be well effected by pneumatic-tyred rollers. The cohesive fi lls for buildings are compacted in
15 cm-to 30 cm-thick layers by heavy rollers of about 25-tonne capacity, whereas for embankments
and dams, heavier rollers of capacity up to 50 tonnes are used. The degree of compaction is
mainly dependent on the nature of moisture content. The effectiveness of compaction of soil
under varying moisture contents is known from the changing density. The relationship between
water content and density of a cohesive soil guides the engineers to decide the thickness of layers
and the types of rollers to be used to obtain 100 per cent compaction at optimum moisture content.
Compaction of in-situ soil
The in-situ soil is compacted by piles. Subsidence of loose sand associated with vibration
at considerable depth may take place due to pile driving. When piles are driven in such soil
consisting of loose sand from the ground to considerable depth, the soil gets compacted causing
reduction in volume and decrease in porosity to a great extent (30–40 per cent). Sandy soil of
small to medium cohesion can also be compacted by pile driving. In this soil, the compaction
is achieved not by vibration but by static pressure. Some types of vibrators combined with
water jet are also effective in bringing about compaction of sandy deposits in natural state.
Pile driving below water table may result in some viscous mass instead of compaction. In such
cases, the method of compaction by preloading may be adopted.
Compaction of organic soil, silt, and clay
Organic soil, silt, and clay that are not easily compressible can be compacted by preloading.
The method includes covering the area of these soils by a fi ll having higher weight per unit area
suffi cient to compress the soil to the required extent. Silty soil with lenses of sands gets easily
compacted but more pressure is required for organic soil without sand lens due to its impermeable
nature. Some drains are provided before preloading in organic and clayey soils to quicken the
process of compacting. A pervious drainage blanket is also laid to allow escape of water from the
soil to the blanket. Though water percentage is high in clay, permeability is very low to practically
nil. Clay is excavated in chunks to a place on the site of the earth structure for use as a construction
material. Neither vibration nor pressure of short duration can change the water content.

6.10.3 Standard and Modifi ed Proctor Test
Proctor test is conducted in the laboratory to decide the relation of density with water content.
The main purpose of the test is to measure the optimum water content at which the soil is to be
compacted to attain maximum dry density. The equipment recommended by BIS for Standard
Proctor test includes a cylindrical metal mould of 10 cm diameter, height 12.7 cm, and volume
1,000 ml, a detachable base plate, a collar of 6 cm effective height, and a rammer of 2.6 kg to fall
from a standard height of 31 cm. The test is conducted in samples of dry soil of less than 4.75 mm
size. The test sample of soil with certain water content is compacted in the mould in three equal
layers with 25 blows by the standard rammer. The dry density of the compacted soil is determined
for the water content and weight of the sample. Several tests are conducted on the samples with
varying water contents and the corresponding dry densities are determined. The bulk density γ for
the corresponding dry density g of each sample is then computed from the following relation:
d
W g
g = g/cm3 and g = g/cm3 (6.31)
V d 1+w
Here, V is the volume of the mould (1,000 ml), w is the water content, and W is the
weight (g) of the wet compacted soil.
A compaction curve for a soil is drawn from the plots of test data with water content
percentage as abscissa and dry density as ordinate, as shown in Fig. 6.12(a). Dry density
increases with decrease in water content until the maximum dry density (g ) is attained at a
d
point ‘X’ in the ordinate corresponding to optimum water content (w ) in the abscissa. The
o
maximum compaction is reached under a specifi c water content when the air voids will be nil.
A line called zero air void line showing the dry density as a function of water content for soil
with no air voids is established by the following relation:
Gg
g = ww g/cm3 (6.32)
d 1+wG
where w is the water content corresponding to specifi c gravity G of the soil.
The modifi ed Proctor test is based on compaction that is about 4.5 times higher than the
Standard Proctor test. This test is carried out to simulate fi eld conditions for soil in areas where
heavy machineries are used in the construction such as earth dams or where there is a movement
of heavy vehicular transport as in an airport. According to IS, in this test, instead of three layers,
fi ve layers are compacted with 25 blows from a 4.89 kg rammer dropped from a height of 45 cm.
Due to such higher compaction of soil in the modifi ed Proctor test, the water content decreases and
the soil density increases. As can be seen from the two curves given in Fig. 6.12(a) maximum dry
density is higher in modifi ed Proctor test with less water content for the same soil. The maximum
water content corresponding to maximum dry density is known as optimum water content.
6.10.4 Proctor Needle and Its Use
Proctor needle is a handy instrument used for rapid measurement of the water content in a
fi eld. The instrument consists of a spring-loaded plunger that holds a graduated needle shank
attached to a needle tip at its lower end. The other end contains a calibrated stem with a handle
for operating the instrument, see Fig. 6.12(b). When the needle tip of certain cross-sectional area
penetrates the soil, a resistance is offered by the soil that is measured by a gauge attached to the
handle. The depths of penetration of the Proctor needle of different cross-sectional areas are
calibrated with respect to soils with different water contents.

data as they are inserted into the ground. Data is
recorded and displayed for the depth of penetration
of the plunger or needle at 1 inch (2.5 cm) intervals
in psi or kPa.
6.11 EARTH PRESSURE AND RETAINING STRUCTURES
If a cut slope in a soil is very steep, it will not stand unsupported. A retaining structure is,
therefore, required to resist the lateral thrust of the soil mass behind the structure. This soil
mass is called backfi ll and the thrust is known as lateral earth pressure. In the case of active
earth pressure, the retaining structure moves away from the backfi ll and a portion of the
backfi ll may break apart keeping the remaining backfi ll portion at rest, see Fig. 6.13(a). The
backfi ll portion that tends to move apart is wedge shaped and is called failure wedge. The
portion at the top of backfi ll above a horizontal plane is called the surcharge and the slope
angle with respect to horizontal is the surcharge angle. At the active state of earth pressure,
the moving force is at the minimum. However, if maximum force is mobilized to bring
failure of the soil mass or backfi ll, it is called passive earth pressure, see Fig. 6.13(b).
While on the verge of failure, the soil mass is in a plastic state of equilibrium. Rankine’s
theory (1857) deals with this state of plastic deformation considering the soil to be non-cohesive
homogeneous in nature. The theory assumes that there is no shearing stress between the soil and
the wall. However, concrete and masonry structures acting as retaining walls have rough surfaces
that develop frictional forces, which are non-existent in Rankin’s assumption. The existing friction
makes the resultant pressure act inclined to the normal to the wall at an angle between the wall and
the soil. This angle is known as the friction angle.

6.11.1 Retaining Structures
The retaining structure namely retaining wall, is constructed to save a vertical or very steeply
excavated soil mass. It is mainly used against steeply inclined soil cuts made for highways
and railways. It is also used as the side wall of embankment fi lls and bridge abutments and
for providing support to the steep sides of industrial structures. The retaining wall may be of
several types such as gravity, cantilever, buttress, and crib walls. The gravity retaining wall may
be plain concrete, masonry, or timber having no tensile stress in any portion of the wall, see Fig.
6.14(a). The cantilever wall generally made of reinforced concrete appears like an inverted ‘T’,
each projecting part acting as a cantilever, see Fig. 6.14(b). This type of structure is suitable for
medium height (6–7m) retaining walls. There is a subtle difference between buttress wall and
counterforts. When the counterforts are provided in the toe side, the retaining wall is called a
buttress wall. So, in the counterfort type, which is suitable for high walls (> 6 m), both the walls
span horizontally between vertical brackets, see Fig. 6.14(c). Sometimes cantilevered walls are
buttressed on the front, or include a counterfort on the back (soil side), to improve their strength
resisting high loads. The crib walls, suitable for medium high structures, are made of timber or
pre-cast concrete or pre-fabricated steel frames and fi lled with granular soil.

6.11.2 Backfi ll—Materials Used and Drainage
The materials used for backfi ll behind the retaining wall are pervious and semi-pervious types of
soil including clean sand or crushed rock (Fig. 6.15). The GW and SW types of soil (see Section
5.7, Table 5.2) are considered good and the GP and SP types of soil satisfactory for backfi ll. The
granular material, however, requires compaction to reduce the lateral pressure and increase the
angle of internal friction. The compaction is done by vibration. Compaction done in 15 cm to 20 cm
layers is suffi ciently dense. In areas free from frost action, GM, GC, SM, and SC types of soil are
also used as backfi ll behind retaining walls, but require elaborate drainage arrangements. In general,
soil containing more than fi ve per cent fi ne particles is not desirable as this prevents good drainage.
The weep holes are provided to the retaining walls to drain out the seepage of water from
the backfi ll using perforated pipes which are inserted into the retaining walls, see Fig. 6.15(a).
When the backfi ll material is pervious, weep holes of 15 cm in diameter are placed horizontally
at intervals of 2 m to 5 m. A fi lter of granular materials is provided at the entrance of each
weep hole to avoid clogging by fi nes. Water seeping through the weep holes may fall on the toe
causing weakness of the retaining wall. To prevent this, a pipe drain is provided along the base
wall in addition to the fi lter material, as shown in Fig. 6.15(b). If the backfi ll is of semi-pervious
type, a vertical strip of fi lter material is provided midway between the weep holes in conjunction
with the horizontal strip of fi lter material, see Fig. 6.15(c). When the backfi ll is fi ne-grained,
nearly 30 cm-thick blanket of pervious material is used at the top, as shown in Fig. 6.15(d).

6.12 SHEAR STRESS, SHEAR STRENGTH, AND FAILURE MECHANISM
Stress is generated in a soil mass when it is loaded by a structure. The weight of the structure exerts
a vertical force, but another force called shear stress is also developed in the soil and is responsible
for the failure of structures. For example, a retaining wall to a soil slope may fail due to the pressure
exerted by the backfi ll. A loaded earth mass such as an earth embankment may slide due to the
stress within the soil that forces a wedge of soil to move out. In all these cases, it is the shear stress
that acts on soil and tends to deform the soil mass eventually bringing about its failure. A soil body
is on the verge of failure when it reaches the limiting shear stress that equals the shear strength of
the soil. The shear stress at this stage is in a state of equilibrium with the shear strength. Any further
increase in shear stress, or decrease in shearing resistance, will disturb the state of equilibrium and
bring about the failure (called shear failure) of the soil body. Failure of a soil mass may also take
place under differential settlement if loads are not uniformly distributed on the surface.
The maximum shear stress that can be sustained by a soil mass before failure is the shear
strength. It is also stated as the shearing resistance of the soil body to deformation or to
movement. The shear strength of soil mass is constituted mainly of cohesion and angle of
internal friction of soil particles. Cohesion is a measure of the forces that cement the particles
of soil. Angle of internal friction is the measure of the shear strength of soil due to friction. In
cohesive soil, both cohesion and friction act as shear resistance, but in non-cohesive soil, only
friction provides shear resistance.

Fundamentals of Soil Mechanics ● 131
The Mohr–Coulomb shear failure criterion is useful to understand the principles of failure of
soil mass. The essential points to be remembered while using Mohr–Coulomb theory are that
a soil material fails due to normal stress on the material as well as shear stress on the failure
plane and that the stresses on the potential failure plane determine the ultimate strength of the
material. The theory is expressed by the following equation:
t = c + s tanf
Here, t is the shear strength, s is the normal stress, c is the cohesion, and f is the angle of
internal friction.
6.12.2 Method to Draw Mohr’s Circle
To start with, the normal stress is plotted along the abscissa (OX) and the shear stress results of a
triaxial test along the ordinate (OY). In Fig. 6.17, the distances Oa and Oa′ plotted along OX represent

Determination of shear strength Shear strength or resistance to shear of soil is determined
by laboratory tests. The test result is used in the design of a structure in soil mass against
possible failure. The tests that are generally conducted in the geotechnical laboratory to measure
the shear strength of soil are direct shear test, triaxial compression test (drained and undrained),
unconfi ned compression test, and Vane shear test. The procedures of these tests are briefl y
described in the following subsections.
6.12.3 Direct Shear Test
The principle involved in the direct shear test is illustrated in the simplifi ed drawing,
Fig. 6.18(a). In the laboratory, the test is conducted in a shear box apparatus consisting of a box in
two separable parts each provided with a porous stone, as shown in Fig. 6.18(b). One part is kept
rigid and the other part movable. The soil specimen is placed between the two porous plates such
that the central surface of the specimen remains at the joint of the shear box. The soil specimen
can be compacted in the shear box by clamping both the parts by means of two screws. Normal
load (s) is applied to the specimen through a pressure pad at the top that tends to keep the
n
specimen in place, whereas shearing force applied to the lower box by jack tends to separate the
specimen into two parts. The shear stress (s) is measured with the help of a proving ring fi tted at
s
the upper part of the shear box. A number of tests are conducted under increasing normal loads.
The applied loads and the shear forces required for failures of the soil specimens are recorded.

6.12.4 Triaxial Compression Test
Triaxial compression test is conducted on a variety of soil types for obtaining the shear strength
parameters namely friction angle and cohesion, and other dependent parameters. The equipment
used in conducting triaxial compression test consists of a specimen cell that is cylindrical in
shape and made of a transparent material such as perspex. There are two tubes at the base of
the testing equipment, one acting as the inlet of cell fl uid and the other as the outlet of pore
water. A third tube attached to the top of the specimen acts as the drainage outlet. A cylindrical
soil specimen of length 2 to 2½ times its diameter is encased in a rubber membrane and placed
between two porous discs—one at the top and the other at the base (Fig. 6.19). The specimen
of cohesive soil is prepared directly from saturated compact sample either undisturbed or
remoulded. For cohesionless soil, the specimen can be prepared with the help of a mould that
maintains the required shape of the specimen.
During testing, vertical stress s is applied by the load on the top of the specimen through the
x
proving ring. The stresses s and s (s = s) act in the horizontal direction through the pressure
y z y z
of fl uid that surrounds the specimen cell. Suppose in one test the fl uid pressure applied is s
z
and the corresponding value of vertical stress obtained at failure is s. Several such tests are
x
conducted and several sets of values are obtained, which are used to draw Mohr’s circles. The
failure envelop at shear is provided by the common tangent to these circles (Fig. 6.20). A Mohr’s
diagram can be drawn from a minimum of two sets of test results to determine c and f values.

There are several variations of triaxial compression tests. The test is done in both consolidated
and unconsolidated specimens in drained and undrained conditions. In the drained test, porous
discs are kept in place and the pore water is allowed to drain out through the outlet. In the undrained
test, instead of porous discs, solid caps are placed at the two ends so that no water is drained out. In a
consolidated drained (CD) test, the specimen is consolidated and sheared in compression allowing
drainage and keeping the rate of axial deformation constant. In the case of consolidated undrained
(CU) test, the specimen is allowed to consolidate with porous caps until consolidation is complete at
the desired confi ning pressure. The drain water outlet is then closed and the specimen is sheared and
the shear characteristics are measured. In the unconsolidated undrained (UU) test, the specimen is
not allowed to drain. The specimen is compressed at a constant rate (i.e., strain controlled).
6.12.5 Unconfi ned Compressive Test
Unconfi ned compressive test is a simple laboratory testing method to quickly determine the
unconfi ned compressive strength of a soil and rock. In the case of soil, this test can be done if
the soil is fi ne grained possessing suffi cient cohesion. The test result is used to calculate the
undrained compression of the soil under unconfi ned conditions.
The unconfi ned compressive strength (d ) is a measure of the load per unit area at which the
1
cylindrical specimen of a cohesive soil fails in compression and this is expressed by the simple
relation:
d = q /A
1 u
where q is the axial load at failure in unconfi ned compressive test and A is the corrected
u
cross-sectional area of the specimen = A /(1 − e).
0
Here A is the initial area of the specimen and e is the axial strain (change in length/original
0
length).
The apparatus for unconfi ned compressive test consists of a load frame fi tted with a proving ring
attached to a dial gauge (Fig. 6.21). The test is conducted on a cylindrical specimen (of length 2 to
2½ times of diameter) placed on hollowed cones to keep the end restraints at the minimum until
the soil specimen fails due to shearing along a critical plane. The normal load (d) is applied from
1
the load frame through the proving to measure the deformation of the soil specimen, but there is
no confi ned horizontal pressure applied on this specimen cell unlike that in a triaxial specimen.
Hence, the test is unconfi ned and uniaxial in which d = d = 0. The loading is continued until
2 3
the load values decrease or remain constant with increasing strain, or until they reach 20 per cent
(sometimes 15 per cent) axial strain. At this state, the soil specimen is considered to be at failure

6.12.6 Vane Shear Test
Vane shear test of soil is done to determine the undrained shear strength of cohesive soil both in
the laboratory and in the fi eld by a simple instrument shown in Fig. 6.22. The vane shear tester
for laboratory use consists of four steel blades, each of 1 mm thickness, 1.2 cm diameter, and 2
cm height. The blades are welded at the bottom of a rod, the top being attached to a torsion wheel
having a calibrated spring arrangement to measure the torque. The vane is pushed inside the soil
sample and the torque rod is rotated slowly at the rate of 1° per minute resulting in the shearing of
the soil along a cylindrical surface. After the shearing is complete, the dial reading is noted. The
spring constant multiplied by the dial reading gives the torque T in kg-cm.
The vane shear tester is the most convenient instrument to carry to the fi eld and conduct fi eld
tests on shear strength of cohesive soil. It can also be attached to the bottom of a borehole in
which case the vane must penetrate at least fi ve times the hole diameter into the soil for testing.
It is to be ensured that the soil at the testing spot is in undisturbed state. The vane size of the fi eld
instrument is generally 5 cm to 10 cm in diameter and 10 cm to 20 cm
Handle in height and it is made of about 2.5 mm thick rectangular metal plates
welded orthogonally with a torque rod and torque applicator assembly.
A pit of one or two metres deep is dug for a fresh surface for the test. To
Scale
proceed with the test, the torque rod carrying the vane is gently pushed
into the soil. Then, by the gearing arrangement, a torque is applied to
the rod passing through a stiff torque spring. Assuming that both the
top and bottom ends of the vane take part in the shearing of the soil,
the torque T required to twist the vane in the soil gives the measure of
the shear resistance of the soil distributed uniformly over the cylinder
rupture surface. From mathematical computation, the following relation
H can be derived to calculate the maximum shear strength (t in kg/cm2)

6.13 BUILDING SITE GEOTECHNICAL INVESTIGATION
In the construction of a building, geotechnical investigation is necessary to evaluate the site
condition with respect to the load-bearing capacity of the foundation materials. The investigation
includes site exploration to fi nd the depth and nature of the materials by laboratory and fi eld testing.
In a light structure, the exploration is restricted to few metres of top layers, but deep drilling is
necessary for heavy structures so that the load of the building can be transmitted to a deep layer.
The geology of the area such as the nature of subsoil condition (bore hole log of subsoil) and
the groundwater level is generally known from the constructed buildings of the neighbouring
area. The foundation load of a building depends mainly on two factors namely the weight of the
building or the dead load and the life load due to the people who will use the building.
6.13.1 Loads of a Building and Foundation Exploration
In fact, the dead load and the life load will vary depending on the type of the building and its
purpose of use. There may be residential buildings of limited dead load and live load. However,
a school building will have high live load. Similarly, a shopping centre building may have
lot of merchandise increasing the dead load. A building may be constructed for a monument
or a temple of heavy loads depending on use of rock slabs or similar construction materials.
A power plant has the impact of regular vibration. Thus, the load factor is decided fi rst from the
type of building to be constructed including the purpose of its use before taking up exploratory
work at the site and foundation of the building. In general, the dead load that acts vertically
down is calculated from the weights of building components and the life load is considered
to be half of dead load or a fraction of it. The other factor is the vibration as in a powerhouse
foundation, which is taken care of in the design according to the type of building.
The methods applied for exploration at the foundation site of building include some pitting
and trenching followed by drilling with a sampler to collect undisturbed samples for laboratory
tests. The programme of drilling depends upon the size and layout of the building or structure.
One hole is to be drilled at the centre and for a large building four more in the four corners.
Depending upon the local geology, generally a hole may be drilled down to the bedrock to get
a complete picture of the subsurface materials and others by wash boring. In alluvial areas with
homogeneous soil type, the holes may penetrate until fi rm soil is available.
The type of laboratory or in-situ testing of the foundation soil will depend upon the soil condition.
In case of any chance of shear failure, the shear testing in laboratory and in-situ condition is to be done.
Consolidation test is performed if settlement of foundation soil is anticipated in addition to routine
laboratory tests on undisturbed soil samples. In addition to exploration, geotechnical investigation
of the building site includes excavation of the site to fi x the foundation grade. In some uneven hilly
terrain, there may be sloping surfaces, which need to be fl attened to obtain foundation grade.
6.13.2 Bearing Capacity of Soil for Building Foundation
The bearing capacity of a soil mass is its ability to support the load of structures for the different
types of buildings. It is related to the extent of load the soil can safely support without causing
failure or damage of structure. This allowable load is also called allowable soil pressure. The failure
of foundation soil takes place when the ultimate bearing capacity exceeds the load of the structure
placed on it. The ultimate bearing capacity (q) is the gross pressure at the base of the foundation.
f
Chapter_06.indd 135 10/18/2012 5:59:18 PM
136 ● Engineering Geology
The safe bearing capacity (q) of a soil is the load per unit area that can be safely supported by
s
the soil mass. The ultimate bearing capacity is divided by the factor of safety, F (resistance force/
driving force), with values such as 2 or 3 or 4, etc., to give the safe bearing capacity. Thus, we have
q = q /F
s f
The ultimate bearing capacity of soil for building foundation depends not only on the nature
of the soil, but also on the method of application of the load. The failure of a structure may be
caused by its sinking down or toppling of its one side and bulging of the underlying soil. Several
layers of the soil around the structure are affected due to the failure of structure, generally
showing bulging (Fig. 6.23).

6.14 DETERMINATION OF BEARING CAPACITY OF SOIL FOR BUILDING SITE
Geotechnical investigations related to determination of ultimate bearing capacity of soil in a
building site or other sites of engineering structures in the fi eld condition can be done using
some simple instruments. The following subsections describe two such instrumental tests.
6.14.1 Static Cone Penetration Test for Building Foundation
Static cone penetration test is generally conducted in a shallow pit to get the in-situ bearing
capacity of the soil. In its simple form, the penetrometer consists of a cone screwed at the
end of a steel rod and a calibrated meter (dial gauge) at the upper end. Depending upon the
angle of the cone, the base area may differ. Figure 6.24 shows a static cone penetrometer with
a cone of 30°, base area 5cm2, and height 4.6 cm. The bearing capacity of the soil is measured
by the resistance offered by the soil to the penetration of the cone neglecting skin friction. The
cone is gently pushed into the soil by applying body weight to the cross handle and load (P)
is recorded from the calibration of dial gauge. The ultimate bearing capacity is obtained by
dividing the load by the base area of the cone.
Dial guage
6.14.2 Plate Load Test
The bearing capacity of a soil is determined in the fi eld by the plate load test.
This test provides data on the rate of settlement of the test plate under gradually
increased loading and ultimate bearing load at which the plate starts settlement
Steel rod at a rapid rate. The plate load test involves the digging of soil up to a depth of
foundation level to make a fl at ground covering suffi cient area to place a square-
shaped (50 cm2 or 75 cm2) rigid plate having a thickness of about 25 mm. A layer
of sand may need to be spread below the plate to level the uneven ground. The
loading to test plate is generally provided by weighed sand bags or steel beams
Cone kept on a platform that connects a calibrated jack as shown in Fig. 6.25(a). The
Fig. 6.24 Static reaction of the pressure (load) applied through the jack is taken by the load on the
cone penetrometer platform and transmitted to the ground.
Chapter_06.indd 136 10/18/2012 5:59:18 PM
Fundamentals of Soil Mechanics ● 137
As per IS recommendation (IS codes 1888 and 1982), the test plate is to be provided with a
seating load of 70 g/cm2 before the start of the actual test. The loads are then placed in the order
of one-fi fth of the expected safe bearing capacity or one-tenth of the ultimate bearing capacity
of the soil. Settlement is observed at certain intervals (1, 5, 10, and 20 minutes until one hour)
by means of two dial gauges of 0.02 sensitivity placed on the two sides of the test plate. The test
with one load is continued until the settlement is reduced to less than 0.02 mm per hour. Then,
the next load increment is made and the test is continued as before. In this way, the maximum
load applied is three times the proposed allowable pressure. After the test, a load increment
versus settlement curve is plotted on l og-log paper to obtain the failure stress, see Fig. 6.25(b).
The safe bearing capacity is taken with safety factor 2 on ultimate bearing capacity. The test is
good for homogeneous and uniform nature of soil throughout the foundation. Since the plate is
small, the test gives a conservative value of the bearing capacity of the foundation soil.

6.15 SHALLOW BUILDING FOUNDATIONS
Soil foundations may be described under two groups, namely shallow and deep. A shallow
foundation is located on the surface of the ground or slightly below it. Common examples of
shallow foundations are spread footings and mat or raft, which is suitable for a light structure
or a building, the total load of which is very limited. The foundation of a structure is considered
to be deep if its depth is equal to or greater than its width. Deep foundation transfers the load
to the underlying stratum. Even if the subsoil is soft or compressible to a suffi cient extent, deep
foundation is taken up to provide adequate support to the structure. The common types of deep
foundations are pile foundation, pier foundation, and caisson or well foundation.
6.15.1 Spread Footing
Spread footing, also known simply as footing, is a type of shallow foundation used to support
columns or walls in the construction of small or medium-size buildings. The footing denotes the
part of the foundation, generally square or rectangular in shape, that remains in contact with the soil.
The footing transmits the load of a column or a wall directly into the soil. The base of the footing
is kept large enough to safely support the imposed load. The common types of footing include
Chapter_06.indd 137 10/18/2012 5:59:18 PM
138 ● Engineering Geology
single footing, stepped footing, and slope footing or battered footing, see Fig. 6.26. The pressure
distribution below the footing is dependent on the rigidity, type, and characteristics of the soil.

6.15.2 Mat or Raft
The mat or raft type of shallow foundation occupies a large area generally covering the entire
base of the structure (Fig. 6.27). Rafts are generally made of reinforced concrete slabs and
used where the bearing capacity of soil is low. In case the structure (i.e., a building) is heavy
and the soil is soft, the use of the mat or raft foundation will be more economical than the
spread footings as the total load being spread over a very

6.15.3 On-grade Mat Foundation
The on-grate mat foundation is extensively used in house building in the US, which has been
proved to have high load-bearing capacity in expansive or ‘hydro collapsible’ (water-bearing)
soils (Fig. 6.28). The foundation (called waffl emat) is created by
connecting a series of 20 cm- to 30 cm- high, 45 cm × 45 cm,
thermal-grade heat-resistant plastic forms, ‘waffl eboxes’, set
directly on grade and then monolithically pouring a post-tension,
re-enforced concrete slab (10–20 cm thick). The completed slab
then sits on the ground like a raft, the void areas underneath the
slab formed by the placement of the forms allowing for expansive

stiffness, with the strength to resist differential swelling resulting from landscaping practices,
surface drainage, or fl ooding from any source.
6.16 DEEP FOUNDATIONS FOR BUILDINGS
The methods followed in deep foundation include pile foundation, pier foundation, and caisson
and are described with illustrations in the following subsections.
6.16.1 Pile Foundation
The widely used type of deep foundation is the pile foundation that supports various types
of heavy structures, especially high-rise buildings. The piles are made of timber, concrete, or
steel. The average diameter of a timber pile is 25 cm to 35 cm. Timber piles are prone to easy
damage and they have small bearing capacity. The concrete piles may be pre-cast or cast-
in-situ types. The pre-cast concrete piles, generally reinforced and square or octagonal in cross
section, are capable of withstanding load up to 80 tonnes. The cast-in-situ types are designed
for a maximum load of 75 tonnes. Prior excavation or boring is required for cast-in-situ piles.
A steel sheet with steel core is driven fi rst into the soil to make a bore. Then, the steel core is
taken out and the annular space is fi lled with concrete.
Different types of piles are used depending upon the subsoil condition as illustrated in
Fig. 6.29. If bedrock is available at a shallow depth, it is preferable to use end-bearing pile that
transfers the load through soft soil to the hard strata below. When the subsoil is of homogenous
nature capable of friction load-carrying, the friction pile is used to transfer the load. In case of
granular sandy soil, compaction pile is used to compact the loose sandy materials and increase
the bearing capacity of the soil. Other types of piles such as tension pile, anchor pile, and fender
pile or their combinations are also used depending upon the subsoil condition.

The steel piles may be H-piles, pipe piles, or sheet piles. The measurement of ‘H’ in a steel
H-pile is 25 cm, 30 cm, and 35 cm in each of its three directions. The H-piles are used as long piles
to withstand the load of heavy structures, especially in the construction of high-rise buildings.
They are used when the bottom stratum is very compact having high supporting capacity.
A combination of concrete and timber, or steel and concrete piles is also used. The piles are
forced into the soil mass to bear the load of the structure. The forcing of piles into the soil is
Chapter_06.indd 139 10/18/2012 5:59:18 PM
140 ● Engineering Geology
done by means of a hammer supported by a crane or pile driver. The ‘resistance’ offered by a
pile is measured by the number of blows needed for one centimetre penetration.
Engineering geological investigation of a site comprising soil where the structure is to be
founded on piles is needed to provide data on the nature of the foundation material and other
relevant aspects. This will help to select the type of the pile to be used according to the soil
type of the site. For example, if the ground contains water or soft soil overlying hard soil or
rock, the decision will be in favour of using end-bearing piles. However, if the structural site is
alternated with layers of clay and sand that provide frictional forces, the deciding pile type will
be frictional pile. Where bedrock or hard and compact soil occurs at a shallow depth, the piles
may be driven up to this fi rm foundation.
An exploratory drilling is to be carried out at the site and samples are to be collected from
the entire depths by use of soil samplers. For building constructions in cities and towns, the
data on foundation soil is available from work already done, though an exploratory work should
be taken up for design requirement. In addition, pile load test is essential to understand the
functions of pile after it is driven into the soil stratum. Observation in this respect is to be made
for a period of nearly one month to fi nd how the pile behaves within the soil mass.
6.16.2 Pier Foundation
Cylindrical and prismatic columns that serve as supports of structures transferring the load
to soil or bedrock are called piers. If rock stratum is available within a shallow depth, it is
always better to extend the pier so that the base rests on the rock. The piers of the extended
base are sunk by open excavation or machine-drilled. These cannot be driven in subsoil
containing rock fragments or boulders unless these are removed by excavation. Piers are of
varying dimensions. Large cylindrical piers are usually 3 m or more in diameter. Construction
of a shallow pier in dry soil is done by open excavation keeping the wall protected by timber
support. However, piers up to suffi cient depth in subsoil are constructed by using machine-
drilled shafts providing casing to protect soil slides from side walls. When piers are of
small dimensions, they are installed by cast-in-situ method. The procedure includes driving
heavy steel pipes or cylinders to subsoil having sharp cutting edges. After the pipe reaches
the desired part of subsoil at the bottom, the pipes are removed and the hole is fi lled with
concrete.
Subsoil condition is an important factor to be considered while selecting the sites for
resting the base of piers. In a bridge involving the construction of several piers, core drilling is
conducted at each of the proposed pier position. It is required to choose dense soil or rock in the
subsurface region on which the load of the bridge can be transferred by the piers that support
the bridge. In case subsoil consists of layered sand and clay deposits, the base must rest on
suffi ciently stiff clay or thick sandy deposit after compaction.
6.16.3 Caisson
Caisson is the French word for ‘box’. A caisson is generally applied to concrete box-like
structures made of timber, masonry, or reinforced concrete. Caissons are taken down from
ground surface to subsurface through water or soft loose soil to meet thick sand, stiff clay
layers, or bedrock for foundation of building and bridge structures. There are three types of
caissons, namely box type, well type, and pneumatic type. A box caisson is open at the top but
closed at the bottom. This type of caisson is used when the load of the structure is relatively
Chapter_06.indd 140 10/18/2012 5:59:18 PM
Fundamentals of Soil Mechanics ● 141
small. In pneumatic caissons, there is a working chamber for men at the bottom part where entry
of water is prevented by using compressed air. Pneumatic caissons facilitate work in subwater
conditions such as the construction of a bridge pier below river water. The caisson becomes an
integral part of the bridge construction for its entire stretch from ground surface to foundation
at depth in dense soil or rock. Caissons that open at both ends are called wells. Well foundations
are commonly used in bridge foundations. A detailed discussion on well foundation is provided
in Chapter 18 (see Section 18.4).

7.1 INTRODUCTION
This chapter discusses the hydraulic parameters of a river followed by its activities.
Rivers originate from upland areas, especially from regions with hills and ridges. At
the initial stage, the water fl ow in a river is very limited, but fed by rainwater, snow,
and ice-melt water, the fl ow increases. As it moves downward, the river erodes the
rocks and soils and forms a deep, V-shaped valley. In the middle or mature stage,
the eroding action of the river is more on the banks and the valley widens. The river
at this stage meanders and at places forms ox-bow lakes. The zigzag movement
of the mature stage river causes bank cutting and smoothening of the valley fl oor
and increases deposition of the eroded sediments, which are carried by the river as
traction load. In the old stage, the river carries lots of fi ne sediments by suspension
in addition to coarse sediments along the fl oor, which are all deposited near the sea.
This is the peneplain stage of the river when it tends to cut through the deposited
sediments to form deltas. The deposited sediments of the river form alluvial soil,
which is very fertile and good for agriculture and is also used in dam construction
and pottery industry. This chapter discusses all these activities of a river and the
utility of the river deposits.
7.2 RIVER HYDROLOGY
River hydrology is the study of a river including its fl ow pattern. A river is constituted
of its channel, bed, and banks. The landform or the valley through which a river
fl ows is its channel, the bottom part of the channel is the bed, and its two sides are
the banks. Hydraulic geometry is the collective term used to describe a river channel
Chapter_07.indd 144 10/18/2012 5:08:37 PM
Hydrology and Geological Works of Rivers ● 145
and the fl ow of its water. The river channel is simply a sloping trough created by the fl ow of
water in the most effective manner for movement of water with sediments. Strictly speaking,
a river channel need not necessarily always contain fl owing water. Many channels of desert
streams are dry most of the time. In River Falgu of Bihar, the water fl ows below the sandy bed,
the upper surface remaining dry most of the time.
7.2.1 Hydraulic Parameters
River fl ow occurs in a long trough-like depression bounded by banks or valley walls that slope
towards the channel. The depth of a river channel is measured at any desired point. The width is
the distance across the river from bank to bank. The channel width is initially very narrow, but
with the movement, the trench of the channel becomes wider and in case of large rivers may be
hundreds of metres.
The hydraulic radius (r) of a channel is measured as
r = A/P
where A is the cross-sectional area, given as the vertical cross section at right angles to the
direction of fl ow, and P is the wetted perimeter, the length of the line of contact of water with
the channel measured along the cross section. The hydraulic radius is essentially equivalent to
the average depth of the river.
The discharge of a river is measured as
Q = a/v
where a is the cross-sectional area of the river and v is the mean velocity. The velocity of a
river depends on the channel gradient, the volume of water fl ow, and the confi guration of the
channel.
The discharge or the volumetric fl ow rate of a river is measured as the volume of water that
passes through a given cross-sectional area of the river channel per unit time. In metric system,
it is recorded in cubic metres per second (cumec). Sediments and soluble materials carried and
deposited by a river may also be referred to as system discharge. The volume of water discharge
is expressed by the following equation:
Q (cumec) = AV
where A is the cross-sectional area (m2) and V is the mean velocity (m/sec). The discharge
variation at a single station may be caused due to the seasonal distribution of rain, seasonal
melting of snow and ice, and water release from upstream dam.
Drainage density The drainage density of a river is given by the total length of the stream
channel in kilometres divided by the basin area.
Sediment yield It is the total quantity of suspended sediments and bed load reaching the
outlet of a drainage basin over a fi xed period of time. Yield is usually expressed as kilograms
per square kilometre per year. It depends on various factors such as the size of drainage
area, basin slope, diameter, sediment type (lithology), vegetable cover, and human land-use
practice.
7.3 EROSIONAL PROCESSES OF A RIVER
The total process of sculpturing by a river involves weathering, mass wasting, and overland
fl ow called fl uvial denudation. The geological work is performed by a river in three integrated
Chapter_07.indd 145 10/18/2012 5:08:38 PM
146 ● Engineering Geology
processes, namely erosion, transportation, and deposition. These phases of geological works
cannot be separated from one another, as where erosion occurs, there must be some transportation
and eventually the particles must come to rest.
When water fl ows over the soil surface, it exerts a shear stress or drag upon the grains. If
the stress is suffi cient to overcome the resistance of cohesive forces binding the grains to the
parent mass, the grains enter into the fl owing water by rolling and dragging down the slope. The
progressive removal of the grains in this manner is called soil erosion. On barren soil surface,
the dropping rainwater dislodges soil particles called splash erosion. On barren land due to
deforestation, the soil is removed by sheet erosion by sheet fl ow, which gradually takes away
the upper fertile layer of soil when subsoil and bedrock remains.
7.3.1 Types of River Erosion
A fl owing river can erode both the banks and the bottom by different processes. In general,
erosion by river water takes place where the river forces exceed the resistance offered by the
materials over which it runs. The various types of river erosion are hydraulic action, attrition,
abrasion, and corrosion.
Hydraulic action is the force of water on the grains projecting from the bed and banks.
Attrition is the disintegration by the collision of the particles that are suspended in water.
Abrasion or corrasion is the mechanical wear caused by the impact of rock particles carried in
the current striking against the rock exposed at the channel surface. It produces solid particles
or sediments that are carried away by the water as suspended material.
Corrosion is the process of dissolving the materials that remain with the water of the river.
Chemical reactions between the ions carried in the river water and the exposed mineral surfaces
result in a form of erosion called corrosion. It is similar to chemical weathering of rocks (see
Section 4.4). The erosion cycle is considered to begin with the uplift of the land mass and ends when
the uplifted land mass is eroded and all that is left is the plain known as peneplain at the base level.
7.3.2 Factors Deciding the Rate of Erosion
The rate of erosion by a river is dependent on the following four factors:
(i) Volume of water and velocity of fl ow
(ii) Character and size of the load
(iii) Rock type and geological structure
(iv) Vegetation that affects stability and permeability

terrain, the river gets water from seepage, springs, or
River snow melt, which increases on its way downwards
being fed by rains and small tributary streams.
Broad river valleys are formed when rivers cut down
sideways into rocks, wearing the slopes on either side.
Alternative beds of hard and soft rocks are easily eroded
resulting in a river valley with stepped cross profi le
(Fig. 7.1). The soft rock layers are easily scoured out

This forms a very steep-sided valley initially, but produces
a broad, fl at-bottom bed valley on further erosion (Fig. 7.2)

bluffs
When the river moves at a high velocity, the solid rocks by
the bank walls or other parts may collapse. This generally
happens when the water moves as rapids or waterfalls.
Dumping The load of the river is the sum of all the dissolved and
sand & grave suspended solid materials that fl ow by forward movement,
vertical movement, and lateral movement. The force of
water erodes the rock and soil on the way, and the sediments

deposited on the bed and banks.
7.4.1 Movement of Sediment Load
The bed load or traction load moves along the river channel. The load increases with the bank
erosion of soil and weathered rocks and corrosion of hard and fractured rocks that may come
on the path of river fl ow. The increase in load also checks the velocity of the water. At places,
by scouring or cavity formation at the bank, the river water may bring bank failures causing
increase in its bed load. The fl ow of a river is generally turbulent in nature. Hence, if there are
any obstacles on its way, eddies are formed in the river causing more erosion and consequent
increase in its load. Eddies take away most of the suspended load.
Both rock and soil mass take part in the process of erosion and deposition in the river bed.
The eroding power of river water depends not only on the softness or weathering condition
of the rocks, but also on the presence of fi ssures and looseness of grains in the rocks. The
river carries a part of the bed load, the coarser and heavier portion by traction and the lighter
and fi ner parts by suspension. Some portions of coarse sediments including fragmented
rocks, cobbles, and pebbles that are formed by water action are also deposited in the two
banks.
Thus, the denudation processes of erosion, transportation, and deposition take place during
the different stages of the river fl ow from its origin in the upland hilly terrain to its meeting
with a sea or lake. The bed load or bank deposit of a river contains boulders, shingles, gravel,
and sand and the river deposits produce alluvial soils, all of which are of great importance in
engineering constructions.
7.4.2 Sediment Load of Indian Rivers
From the earlier discussion, it is apparent that a river degrades or erodes some stretches of
the bed and aggrades or builds other parts, thus keeping a concave profi le. Even after these
activities, it has enough velocity to carry the load so that just above the sea level it forms a
peneplain. An estimate shows that the rivers of the globe discharge about 15–16 × 1016 tonnes
of sediments per year (Walling and Webb 1983) into the oceans. The erosion and deposition
of an individual river depends largely on its discharge––the product of its volume and velocity.
For example, the discharge of the river Amazon in South America is 180,000 cubic metres per
second, which is ten times more than the discharge of the river Mississippi. The sediment loads
carried by the major Indian rivers are shown in Table 7.1.

For large rivers of India such as the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, the fl ow pattern is affected
to a large extent by the wet and dry seasons. The stream velocity also depends to a large extent
on the particle size. In other words, the stream velocity affects differently sized particles in
different ways. Figure 7.3 shows the sediment load and the suspended particles of the Ganges
in different places of fl ow.

7.4.3 Different Ways of Transporting Load by a River
The transportation of the load is executed by a river in two contrasting ways, that is, within the
current and along the base of the current. In fact, transportation takes place by four different
ways—traction,saltation, suspension, andsolution.
The rolling of the coarse particles along the river bed is called traction. In the process of
saltation, a particle may rise as much as 30 cm above the fl oor and travel down some distance and

then be pulled back by gravity, which is in fact a jumping motion. Suspension is the process of
carrying fi ne sediments such as silt and clay with water fl ow. The materials that are dissolved by
water come from rocks such as limestone and some salts of potash and other compounds present
in the soil. These dissolved materials in the sediments are carried by fl owing water as solution.
7.5 WORK-ACTIVITIES OF A RIVER IN DIFFERENT STAGES
William Morris David (1850–1934) fi rst gave the idea of the erosion cycle, which is known as
David erosion cycle. It includes three stages of river activity beginning from its origin in a hilly
region until its fl ow into a sea, in many cases forming a delta (Figs 7.4 and 7.5). These three
stages are as follows:
(i) Youth stage
(ii) Mature stage
(iii) Old stage
In the youth stage of the cycle, the river erodes headward actively and the valley is deep and
V-shaped due to downcutting, see Fig. 7.6(a). The stage of maturity is activated when the valley
is cut into uplifted blocks, new network of tributaries are formed, and all valleys show fl attened
V-shaped profi les and large deposition Fig. 7.6(b). In the old stage, the river has low relief across
which it fl ows with huge deposits of fi ne sediments, see Fig. 7.6(c).

7.5.1 Work-activities of a Young Stage River
At the initial or young stage, the river valley starts to form from high up on hill slopes where
springs erupt or rain water causes splash and then rill erosions. In its upper course, a river
may be a small, fast-fl owing torrent cutting down into its bed and forms rapids and waterfalls.
Floods accelerate the process, transforming rocks that create rock pool. Several features are
commonly seen in the young stage when the river moves through the hills and mountains. Of
these features, the most prominent is the headwater erosion when undercutting, rain wash, and
soil creep help to slice the hillside and lengthens the river. At places, circular holes (potholes)
are formed in stream bed by whirling water with pebbles and
Spur rock fragments.
River During the zigzag movement of the river in the outside of bends,
the current fl ow is vigorous. This develops a deep and steep cross
section with downward erosion through interlocking spurs and
ridges projecting from the sides of the valley (Fig. 7.7). During its
forward movement, the young river erodes the spurs and widens
the valley fl oor. A young stage river fl ows through the uneven hilly
track of its origin carrying little water but the volume of water
increases with rains. At this stage, the gradient being steep, stream
fl ow is very fast and results in high erosion of rock. The young

terrain
The force of the fl owing river water easily
erodes the soft and soluble rocks, but if the rocks
on its fl ow path are hard alternated with soft beds, a
waterfall may be formed by differential erosion by
the running water as clearly illustrated in Fig. 7.9.
As seen in this fi gure, the soft rocks are eroded by
undercutting and the overhanging hard rock ledge
is broken and taken away by the fl ush of water
forming a plunge pool. In case the rock is weak due
to joints, fractures, and faults, they may be easily
dislodged forming very deep waterfalls (Fig. 7.10).
As a result of this widespread erosion of the
river, the valley becomes wider. The eroded
materials of the youth stage river are full of rock
fragments, cobbles, pebbles, and coarse particles
such as gravel and sand, which are carried as bed
load. This heavy load of the eroded materials
is mostly deposited in course of its downward
movement in an irregular fashion on the two

7.5.2 Middle or Mature Stage Work and Meandering Flow
During the course of its fl ow down from the hilly terrains, the gradient of the river fl attens and
the volume of water further increases with rains and the water of the tributary streams (Fig. 7.6b).
This is the middle or mature stage of the river. The length of the river at this stage is increased

by head erosion and widened by bank erosion and
backward cutting. It changes course frequently and
fl ows in a meandering pattern causing deposition
of sediments along and inside of the curve. In fact,

whereas the heavier particles including pebbles

and cobbles are bounced or dragged at the river
bottom and partly taken to the sides.
With more downward fl ow at this mature stage,
the river is further enriched by the groundwater
drainage from other rainwater catchments. As the
river fl ows down to its middle section, it shows
more mature features than the upper course. The
gradient of the river becomes gentler but the
current fl ow is suffi cient to transport the load of
sediments from its upper course to the downward
path. The downcutting at this stage is minimal
and the river cuts more to the sides taking the
load downward. In the process, the valley fl oor
broadens. The eroded materials from downcutting
and bank erosion still include pebbles and rock
fragments but are mostly gravels, sand, and silt,
which fi ll the wide valley (Fig. 7.13). The river
at this stage during rains inundates the areas on

River terrace
At the mature stage, a river may start vigorous
cutting of its sides boosted by heavy rainfall. This
causes formation of a bench or step that extends
along the sides of a valley and represents a former
level of the valley fl oor. The step generally has a
fl at top made up of sedimentary deposits and a
steep fore edge. These step-like features called
river terrace (Fig. 7.14) may result from a change in
ocean level or by tectonic uplift of sediments carried
by the river. Normally, these are the remnants of

The changes in elevation may be due to the

7.5.3 Old Stage Work and Formation of Deltas
Fig. 7.12 Meandering river forming an ox-bow
lake In course of further downstream movement towards
its fi nal destination to a lake or sea, the river fl ow is
relatively slow and its gradient becomes almost fl at (the peneplain stage) and the load is mainly
composed of sand and fi ner particles such as clay and silt (Fig. 7.15). Vast quantities of these
sediments built the fl oodplains. When its river fl oor attains the level of the sea or the lake into
which it fi nally fl ows, the river reaches its base level of erosion and then the erosion of bottom
part or downcutting is stopped. At this old stage, huge piles of sediments consisting mainly of
silt and clay-size particles are deposited in the sea
or lake. At the confl uence of a river with the sea,
the reduction in fl ow rate causes large deposition
of the sediments into the river, thereby raising
the level of the deposit close to its water surface.
At the old stage, as the river proceeds to meet the
sea, its fl ow cuts through the deposited materials
in different branches forming swamps and deltas
(named so as they look like the Greek word delta
Δ) roughly of triangular shape (Fig. 7.16). Deltas
are formed when a river fl ows into a body of
standing water, such as a sea or lake, and deposits
large quantities of sediment. The deposition rate is

made by a stream at the place of entrance into
a permanent body of water (Twenhofel 1950).
The major portion of the deltaic sediments is
deposited subaqueously in the permanent body
of water where waves and currents aid in the
transportation and deposition. A delta is formed
primarily by the deposition of river sediments in
both the subaerial and submerged bodies of water
(ocean or lake). The deposition of sediments at
deltaic regions result in characteristic structures
such as topset deposits, foreset deposits, and

7.6 CHARACTERISTIC DEPOSITION OF DELTAIC ENVIRONMENT
The product of the sediments carried by rivers and deposited in lake water is the lacustrine soil
composed mostly of fi ne sand, silt, and clay. Since the lake water is still, graded bedding with
well-sorted grains is formed in lacustrine deposits. The lacustrine
soils are frequently found to contain large quantities of organic
matters. In shallow lakes, the deposition of vegetable matters even
forms peat from the assemblage of vegetable decay, and as such
this organic soil is avoided in engineering constructions.
The rivers while being geological agents of erosion and
transportation also act as environments of sediments deposits. The
deposit of sediments by rivers is known as alluvium. When a river
leaves a bedrock valley in a highland and enters open lowland
where it can change directions, it deposits fans. There are low, fan-
shaped cones of alluvial sand and rock fragments ranging from a
few metres to several kilometres in extent.

154 ● Engineering Geology
Braided channels (Fig. 7.17) that are formed near a delta are typically broad and shallow.
They are formed where the river has variable discharge and easily erodible banks. The building
of braided channel is interspersed with bars and islands. The Ganges is a good example of a
river having braided channels close to the deltaic region.
7.7 RIVER DRAINAGE PATTERNS AND RIVER CAPTURE
The land drained by a river is eroded to form a drainage basin of different patterns depending
on the nature of the bedrock, the rock structure, and the erosional effects of the river. If a river
drains through a sequence of sedimentary rocks, these will be worn away rapidly compared to
other rocks due to their softness. In a soluble rock such as limestone, the river may create cavities
by solution action and may drain through the cavities. If the rocks possess faults and fi ssures,
the river will easily widen the fi ssures or faulted rocks. Thus, the type of the rock and the rock
structures will decide the drainage pattern to a great extent. Of the various drainage patterns
generally seen, the common ones are dendritic, radial, trellis, and rectangular (Fig. 7.18).
The dendritic pattern appears like a tree with branches provided by the tributaries. The pattern
is formed when the bedrock is fairly uniform in nature. A geological structure such as a fault may
cause certain changes as seen in the northern part of Fig. 7.18(b).
The radial drainage develops over central headlands such as an uplift, anticline fold, or dome.
The trellis pattern is produced by the fl ow of the consequent stream along the land’s original
slope and later by the fl ow of subsequent streams at right angles to the former.
The rectangular pattern is formed when the rocks through which the river fl ows possess
joints intersecting at right angles or soft bedrock.
River capture This involves a river eroding headward until it acquires another river’s
headwaters at a so-called elbow of capture. It cuts back its valley into that of the weaker river,
thus enlarging its drainage basin at the expense of the other. The river whose headstream has

been captured often dries up or fl ows as a misfi t river in a valley that is too large to have been
eroded by the present capacity of the river.
In Fig. 7.19(a), river A, having a good discharge, captures the headwater of another river B
fl owing at a distance by elbow near C. This results in the downward portion of the captured

An instance of river capture is an ancient river of India. ‘It transpires that the Aryans explored
the river Ganges and its tributaries thoroughly during the Vedic period. The river that Saraswati
fl owed during the Vedic time was later lost in the Bikanir desert due to the river-capture by the
Yamuna which now fl ows through north India and meets with the Ganges. The river Saraswati,
now completely dried up, was the holiest of all the rivers of India during the Vedic time and its
name has been mentioned in many of the slokas of Rig Veda. The river Saraswati, a victim of
river-capture, is specially signifi cance in Indian history as it nourished a glorious civilisation of
India along it large valley area nearly 5000 years ago’ (Gangopadhyay, 2002a).
7.8 ENGINEERING USES OF RIVER DEPOSITS/ALLUVIAL SOIL
Rivers in different stages of their activities create different kinds of deposits depending on
the nature and size of the materials. The materials of these deposits have manifold uses. The
homogeneous types of riverine deposits containing mostly gravel or coarse-grained sand are
widely used as construction materials for concrete aggregates. Since the fi ner river deposits
(alluvial soil) are mostly porous and permeable in nature, construction of earthen structures
on this soil requires an impervious core in addition to drainage arrangements. Alluvial deposit
with suffi cient clay is used for earthen dams. The clayey and silty type of alluvial soil with good
plasticity is used for the impervious core of embankments and rock-fi ll dams.
Alluvial soil is widely used for making bricks and in pottery industry. Many of the large cities
and towns of India are located on alluvial soil where numerous tall buildings are constructed on
pile foundation because of the low shear strength of the materials. Many highways and railways are
also constructed on the alluvial soil after proper compaction and adequate drainage arrangements.
Expansive soils or organic matters also sometimes occur in alluvial soil along road
alignments when these require replacement by non-expansive and non-organic soil followed
by compaction. The piers of the bridges located on alluvial soil require founding on hard strata
at suffi cient depth or on thick deposit of sandy clay of adequate bearing capacity to prevent
settlements (see Section 18.7).

landforms
8.1 INTRODUCTION
Geological works of oceans are responsible in many ways for changing the earth’s
landform, especially the coastal areas. The chief agents of an ocean that take part in
the changing processes are waves, tides, and currents. The action of waves depends
on the strength of the winds. Tides are caused by the gravitational pull of the moon
and the sun. Waves produce currents that cause undercutting of the cliff rocks,
resulting in the fragmentation of rocks. The seaward movement of the fragments of
rocks causes further disintegration and deposition along the coastal land, forming
beaches full of sand, gravel, and shingles.
Widespread erosion takes place along the coastal areas especially by littoral
current, which may destroy beaches. The erosional effect including subsidence of
coastal landform hinders navigation of ships to and from the coastal harbours and
causes distress to the inhabitants of the coastal areas. This chapter describes with
illustrations the processes responsible for the erosion of wide areas along the coast
and the coastal management required to protect the coastal landform.
8.2 OCEAN FEATURES AND DIVISIONS OF OCEAN FLOOR
The oceans of our planet span across several kilometres and they cover 70 per cent
of the earth’s surface area. However, they are not only large water bodies but they
also shape the inland surfaces of the earth including their fl oors to a great extent.
The study of the ocean requires knowledge of different z ones of oceans and ocean
fl oor features. The zone where the ocean meets the land is the intertidal zone. This
zone is divided into high-tide and low-tide zones depending on the depths at which
these tides occur. Above the tidal zone is the beach. The area termed neritic zone is
Chapter_08.indd 158 10/18/2012 9:40:05 PM

next to the tidal zone. It is rather a narrow shallow region along the continental shelf. This zone
always remains under water as it stretches from the low tide line to the edge of the continental
shelf. Below the neritic zone is the oceanic zone (Fig. 8.1).

Fig. 8.1 Major features of ocean, continental fl oor, and coastal area
The ocean fl oor down to a depth of about 200 m is termed the continental shelf. The fl oor
steepens further down along the continental slope to several kilometres until it meets the deepest
part of the ocean called abyssal zone. This is separated from the continental slope by an abrupt
marginal slope at the end of which there are sediment deposits mainly of clay and silts. The
abyssal zone of the ocean fl oor varies in depth from 2.2 km to 5.5 km and this zone lies between
the continental rise and the mid-ocean ridges. The abyssal plains are very fl at because of the
deposition of piles of fi ne sediments at the ocean fl oor.
The sediments of the abyssal depth are mainly transported by turbidity current. Transporting
of the sediments off the edges of the continental shelf and onto the ocean fl oor including
the abyssal plains form turbidity current and the thick deposits of sediments brought by this
current are termed turbidites. A submarine landslide stirs up lots of sediments into suspension.
This mixture is considerably dense than the surrounding ocean fl oor and the turbidity mass of
sediments of the entrained water which comes down the slope.
The ocean fl oor also contains several ridges and volcanic peaks, predominantly in the Pacifi c
Ocean. Most of these volcanic peaks that have released lava in the ocean fl oor have now risen
above the sea as in the case of the Hawaiian Islands. Several large trenches are also present in
the ocean near the Hawaiian Islands. The mid-Atlantic ridges are a ridge system present at the
middle of the ocean. In general, these ridges are associated with the plate divergence and the
production of new crustal material (see Section 20.4).
8.3 AGENTS OF OCEAN ACTIVITY
The most active as well as obvious work of the oceans is the sculpturing of the coasts, the
zones where the land meets the ocean water. Coastal lands include cliffs and shores, which are
areas between low water and highest storm water waves, and also beaches, the place of shore
deposits. When ocean water is in violent motion, it scours coasts around the world. The eroded
materials are deposited on the lands at the fringe of the ocean water, that is, the coasts. Along
rocky shores, the water laden with rock fragments batters the land away. However, fragments

160 ● Engineering Geology
torn from the cliff-fringed coasts are deposited gently on shores to raise beaches with sand,
gravel, and shingles. Hence, most coasts advance or retreat. The chief agents in the process of
ocean activities are the waves and currents, but tides also contribute to a great extent.
8.3.1 Waves—Characteristics and Activities
Ocean waves play an active part in the erosion of coastlines and can create many types of land
features within the ocean or close to the coastal land. Hence, knowledge of the characteristics
of waves is essential. The height of a wave is the maximum distance between its crest and
trough. The distance between consecutive crests or troughs of a is its wavelength. Waves are
undulations set in motion mainly by the wind. Wave energy increases with wind energy. The
waves that are far away from the shore in the open water are the oscillatory waves (Fig. 8.2).
In these waves, the movement is up and down and vertical in nature. The velocity of a wave is
dependent on its height as well as the length and the depth of water and the orbital motion of
the wave particles. In the open ocean, waves pass through the water without moving it forward.

Wave crest Wavelength Wave crest

Wave trough
Fig. 8.2 Wave parameters and oscillatory movement of
water at each point of wave surface
When waves approach towards the coastline, their bases drag on the ocean fl oor, whereas the
crests continue to move towards the land. Eventually, the waves topple over themselves. During
storms, waves behave in two distinct ways as an agent of erosion:
First, the high waves dashing against the rocky shore with suffi cient force loosen the materials
from the rock body and cause its fragmentation. If the area contains loose sandy materials, the
erosion will be of serious nature. The wave acts at an angle on the shore and not normal to the
shoreline. This creates a net fl ow of water called longshore currents fl owing along the coastline.
Second, as the waves loosen the materials and carry them towards the offshore, the longshore
currents transport them over a distance of several kilometres. Thus, a beach of sand may lose
most of its materials and eventually a good beach may lose its existence. Coastal management
aims to check such situations and save the beach.
8.3.2 Current—Types and Behaviour
The two common types of current are undertow or underwater current and the longshore
or littoral current. When ocean waves hit the shoreline, there will be currents that move
back towards the ocean. Such retreating current below the oncoming waves is known as the
underwater current. When a wave attacks a cliff in the shore, it will batter the rock and causes its
fragmentation which will move forward and backward. In the process, the size of the fragments
will be reduced and they are transferred to the shallower to deeper parts. Density currents are
suspension currents that transport sediments by suspension. These currents may carry particles
over a distance of several kilometres from the mouth of large rivers fl owing into the ocean. Such
kinds of current can be seen even in the reservoir water of dam projects.

8.3.3 Tides—Patterns and Effects
Tides are the rhythmic rise and fall of ocean water caused by the gravitational pull of the moon
and the sun, noticeable along the coastline. Coinciding with storm waves, the highest tides
affect the highest level of the ocean shore. The difference between high tide and low tide is the
tidal range. Since the moon is nearly 400 times nearer to the earth than the sun, it is the main
celestial body that produces tides. A tidal bulge is produced on two sides of the earth, the side
facing the moon and the one opposite to the moon. This results in two high tides and two low
tides every day as the earth rotates through the bulges.
Tidal heights vary throughout the month due
to the changes in the positions of the sun, moon,
and the earth. The two extreme conditions are the

spring tides and neap tides. Spring tides occur
To sun when the earth, the moon, and the sun are all in
alignment, that is, under the greatest gravitational
Earth pull during the full moon and the new moon phases
(Fig. 8.3). Tidal ranges are at a maximum and the
Fig. 8.3 Spring tide (maximum tidal range) tides at their highest. Neap tides occur when the
sun, moon, and earth are at right angles (Fig. 8.4).
The tidal range is minimal at neap tide since the
gravitational stresses are not aligned. In a diurnal
First quater (moon) or daily tidal pattern, there will be one high tide and
one low tide each day. The semidiurnal or semi-

tides within a 24-hour period having approximately
Earth equal heights each tidal day, whereas in the mixed
type there are two high tides and two low tides each
day with markedly different heights. So, in contrast
Third quater (moon) to the semidiurnal type, the heights of the high and
low tides of a mixed tidal pattern vary signifi cantly.
Fig. 8.4 Neap tide (minimum tidal range)
8.4 LANDFORMS CREATED BY OCEAN
EROSION
In shallow water, the forward movement of waves
causes undercutting of landscape and formation
of cliff until its unsupported top collapses. If
the cliff rock is hard, the cliff slope formed is
generally steep except splitting of jointed rocks
(Fig. 8.5). If the beds or bands in the cliff rock
slope towards the ocean, overhanging cliffs may
be formed, but if the beds are landwards, the
slope will be gentle in nature (Fig. 8.6).
Where the cliff contains soft rocks dipping
landward, the cliff is liable to be undermined by
Fig. 8.5 Hard rock creating steep slopes of cliff
rocks with a sand beach in front, the bed slope being ocean water. In such circumstances, it is common
landwards to see caves at the cliff foot. Geological structures

162 ● Engineering Geology
such as faults, shear zones, or joints often control
the erosion to form headlands and bays. Figure 8.7
shows how geological structures control the
formation of headlands and bays. Ocean water
easily erodes the crushed rocks from the fault
zones keeping the resistant rocks intact, thereby
producing the bay and headland. The block
diagram in Fig. 8.8 gives a clear view of mainland
and well-developed headland and bay, which is
utilized for different purposes such as human
settlement, sea port, and lighthouse (Fig. 8.9).
There may be long cliffs in areas near the
Fig. 8.6 Cliff rock with gentle seaward slope
coast facing the ocean water (Fig. 8.10), which
by erosion will form different features. The ocean waves scour parts of the rocky coastline,
leaving a vertical face above the water and a platform below the ocean water. It does this fi rst
by cutting a notch out of the rocky land near the bottom of the cliff, which leads to instability
above the notch. Then, the portion above the notch is eroded by the process of mass wasting,
while the portion below the notch is left intact as rocky cliff as explained by Fig. 8.11.
Further battering of the coastline by the waves creates caves. The waves throw particles of
rock at the land, which causes abrasion, the process by which the land is slowly rubbed away by
friction between the coastline sediment and the headline rock. At weak points in the cliffs along

a coastline, the abrasion rounds out a bowl-
shaped feature at the bottom of the cliff called
an ocean cave. The ocean arches are the next
step and are formed when the caves continue to
be eroded by the waves.
An arch is formed when two caves on each
side of a headland join in the middle, creating a
mini-tunnel through the cliffs, which on further
erosion takes on the shape of an arch. Over a

8.5 SOME TYPICAL OCEANIC LANDFORMS
If ocean level rises or coastal land subsides, ocean water may enter the low-lying coastal areas
to form different features as observed in different parts of the world. Some of these oceanic
features such as fjords, fjards, dalmatian coastlines, and estuaries are described in this section.
Chapter_08.indd 163 10/18/2012 9:40:06 PM
164 ● Engineering Geology
Fjords are lowland ocean inlets along the coast with high sides and U-shaped cross profi le
(Fig. 8.13). These are deepened by glaciers that deposit the end moraines. Such coastal
features are found in Norway, Alaska, New Zealand, Greenland, and some other parts of the
world.
Fjards are also lowland ocean inlets deepened by glaciers, but are V-shaped in surface
confi guration. They are similar to fjords but are often with small islands at the ocean end
(Fig. 8.14). These are found mostly in the southern part of Sweden and also in Nova Scotia.

coastlines occurring parallel to ocean (Fig. 8.15). Flooding along the coastal land has also
formed valleys and small isolated ridges as narrow offshore islands. The name has been taken
from croatia’s dalmatian coast where these features are very prominently present.
Estuaries are parts of the lowland tidal river mouth fl anked by mudfl ats (Fig. 8.16). Many
of the estuaries occur as submerged river valleys owing their existence to the post-glacial rise
in sea level and hence they usually contain lots of deposited sediments. Some estuaries show
intricate patterns of channels, largely the results of erosion by both incoming and outgoing
tidal rivers. These characteristic features are seen in many river mouths such as the Thames, St
Lawrence, and the Ganges.

8.6 COASTAL LANDFORMS OF VARIED PATTERNS AND DEPOSITS
Oceans may give rise to different types of landforms along the coasts by the deposition of
eroded materials. Waves especially during storms act as the main architect of sculpturing
the coast by means of deposition of eroded materials. In fact, storm waves deposit a large
quantity of pebbles, sand, silt, and clay in the coastal bed to give rise to landforms of different
patterns.

Geological Works of Oceans and Coastal Management ● 165
As explained in Section 8.8, littoral current produced by the action of waves moving at an
angle to the coast carry huge loads of sand, silt, and pebbles. Extensive beaches are formed
when the coast land slopes gently towards the ocean. However, when the current is drifted back
towards the ocean, materials are also carried away from the coast as offshore deposits even on
steeply sloping coastal fl oor. The following are a few illustrative examples of beaches of varied
materials and characteristic deposition:
Crescent-shaped beaches These are formed at the bay lying between two rocky lands. The
beach area is small in extension and is made mainly of sand (Fig. 8.17).
Fig. 8.17 A distant view of several small beaches between two
rocky areas (see Fig. 8.5 for a closer view of a part)
Longshore beaches These are present in a narrow belt extending for a long distance in coastal
areas. Such beaches are covered mainly by thick deposits of sand (Fig. 8.18).

Lowland beach This is formed in the upper shore region occupying broad areas consisting
mainly of sand with a fringe of pebbles and rock fragments in the upper parts of the shore. This
is often backed by sand dunes blown inland by the onshore winds (Fig. 8.19).

Mudfl ats and salt marshes Deposition of silt and clay by tides that are drowned at high tide
forms mudfl ats and salt marshes in estuaries and bay areas. In the Bay of Bengal of eastern
India, swamps of mangrove trees grow in plenty in such mudfl ats and marshy lands.

inclusive of a small part of water. Foreshore is
the portion extended towards the sea and the
backward part is the backshore (Fig. 8.20).
Fig. 8.20 Different parts of coastal land The foreshore is affected by the waves and
currents of ocean water, whereas the backshore
having several berms is affected by erosion and subsidence, mostly by high tides and swelling
water. However, tsunamis have a devastating impact on both the foreshore and the backshore.
8.7.1 Basic Aspects
Coastal erosion causes long-term losses of rocks and sediments from the areas near the sea. It
may also cause redistribution of coastal sediments. The erosion may be caused by hydraulic
action, abrasion, impact, and corrosion. The waves generated by the wind move forward
with oscillatory movements of high amplitudes. During the wave movement, the sands also
move to and fro. The rocks forming the coastal landforms are also subjected to erosion. The
eroded materials are taken away with the water when the rocks chip and the denser particles
Chapter_08.indd 166 10/18/2012 9:40:07 PM
Geological Works of Oceans and Coastal Management ● 167
are taken back and deposited again at the edge. This forward and backward movement of the
particles is a continuous process.
Two types of currents fl ow along the coast, namely undertow and longshore or littoral
currents. The undertow current is formed below the wave and usually fl ows away from the
shore. The longshore current is of great signifi cance to engineers as this plays an important
role in the erosional activity of the seashore. Another important agent of sea erosion is the
tide, which has the maximum impact when the sun, moon, and earth are in a line. Sometimes,
tidal rivers fl ow into the sea and infl uenced by the tidal effect cause deep erosion of the
confl uence area.
Sands of varying thicknesses in the coastal areas may form a large beach but the seashore
remains submerged under water. Beaches may be of varying types according to their shape.
A foreshore beach may be almost fl at (slope 1:120), gentle (slope 1:30), or steep (slope
1:15). The sand particles of a beach are fi ner towards the steeper slope and coarser towards
the gentler slope. In other words, the increase in coarseness of sand depends on the increase
in steepness of the beach. The morphology of a foreshore varies to a great extent having
troughs at some places and terraces in some areas. The littoral zone together with some
berms and the gentle slope of the sea extending down to about 200 m is the continental
shelf beyond which is the neritic zone followed by the oceanic zone and the abyssal plain
(Fig. 8.1).
8.7.2 Harmful Effects of Coastal Erosion
Coastal erosion is one of the most signifi cant hazards associated with coasts. It is responsible
for the loss of subaerial landmass to sea due to natural processes such as waves, currents,
and tides. The force of the waves and currents tends to move the sand from the shore and
thus the landform slowly gets eroded bringing about a change in both the size and the shape
of the coast. However, the erosional effect does not cause instantaneous destruction like a
tsunami. Tsunami is associated with earthquake occurring in the seabed creating a massive
release of energy and materials and causing a storm-like effect, whereas coastal erosion is
a slow process of wave, current, and tide actions that extend over several months and even
years. Other causes of coastal erosion include the change in sea level and the morphology of
the shore.
8.7.3 Erosion of Beaches and Dunes
Large-scale erosion of beaches may be induced by storms. This phenomenon is associated with
the natural evolutionary process of the sediments in sloping beaches. A storm increases the
wave energy, which can easily remove the sediments from the berms and dunes. The removed
sediments are then deposited as near-shore bars. Sand dunes can also act as stores of sediments
used to carry out the coastal processes. This bulk removal of sand from the beaches and dunes
is signifi cant from hazard perspective.
Human interference is also responsible to some extent for the erosional processes.
Construction of building and other engineering structures, dredging of sea shore, mining of
beach sand, and even the construction of a dam across a river with its tailwater fl owing into
the sea add to seashore erosion. The presence of humans and their developmental activities
in the coastal areas without considering or rather neglecting the coastal environment has had
harmful effects.

168 ● Engineering Geology
8.7.4 Erosion of Rocky Coast or Cliff Areas
Though coastal erosion is more prominent along the plain landform, the rocky cliff areas present at
the coast are also affected to a great extent by erosion. These areas are exposed to storms. Hence,
the waves act as a very powerful erosive agent on the coastline and cut the coastline back into a
cliff. The erosion is strongest near the level where the waves break and as such it does not cut down
much below the intertidal level. A platform created as a result of cutting by the waves may be seen
during low tide, extending towards the ocean water for 100 m or more from the foot of the cliff.
Coastal hill slopes covered by soil mass are subjected to easy erosion and slides after
saturation with rainwater, which hastens the process of erosion. If the soil mass or rock of the
cliff face is porous, it can absorb more water and the cliff face undergoes slope failure, causing
extensive loss of coastal land after the slid materials are taken to the foreshore sea. The rate at
which the cliff fall debris is removed from the foreshore depends on the power of the waves
moving towards the coast.
The erodibility of the ocean-facing rocks is controlled by the strength and presence of fi ssures
and beds of non-cohesion materials such as sand and silt. Rocky coastal areas having layers of
fractured rocks produce varying amounts of resistance to erosion. Fractured rocks are eroded
fast and change the coastal landform forming pillars, columns, tunnels or bridge-like structures
in the rocky cliff. The rocky cliff of the shore comprising hard rocks may avoid erosion to some
extent, but in course of time—over hundreds and thousands of years—the process of erosion
by high tidal water may eventually result in isolated upright pinnacles of rock ledge in place of
massive rocks as may be seen in Fig. 8.21.

8.8 LITTORAL DRIFTS
Longshore drift or littoral drift can be defi ned in
terms of the systems within the surf zone (Fig. 8.22).
The direction of the littoral drift generally becomes
obvious on observation. Fluorescent die or radioactive
tracer may also be used to fi nd the direction and
quantifi cation of drift material. The deposition of
the drift materials is infl uenced by the processes
occurring in the surf zone that also largely control
the erosion of the sediments. The longshore currents
generate waves oblique to shore-break waves, which

drift.
Figure 8.22 shows that sediments transported along the shore and surf zone are infl uenced
by the swash in the direction of the prevailing wind, which moves the shingles up the beach
at an angle of wind direction, and also the backwash, which moves the shingles back down
the beach. Longshore drift commonly transports sediments of sizes varying from shingles
to gravel. Sand is affected by the oscillatory forces of breaking waves, and hence shingle
beaches are generally much steeper than sandy beaches.
Creation of ports and harbours throughout the world can have a serious impact on the natural
course of littoral drift. The major impact is the alteration of the sedimentation pattern, which
may lead to erosion of a beach or coastal system. Waves usually surge onto a beach at an
oblique angle and their swash takes sediments up and along the beach. The backwash usually
drains back down the beach at an angle to the coast. The movement of the sediments depends
upon the wind direction in the area close to the surf area of the littoral zone.
8.9 COASTAL MANAGEMENT
Coastal management includes both restoration and protection of the shore. In general, people
living close to the seashore have a profound interest in maintaining their beach area. In fact,
certain protective measures are taken to prevent the erosion of the beach and the coastal
land. Such measures include the construction of groynes, concrete or masonry walls, and
dunes and involve certain restoration works for the beaches as explained in the following
subsections.
8.9.1 Groynes, Gabions, Concrete Walls, and Sand Dunes
Groynes One method of maintaining the shore involves the construction of groynes
(Fig. 8.23), which can be made of wood, cement, or rock. A groyne is a littoral barrier placed
generally at right angles to the shore. It involves building a wall of height generally 1 m to 2 m
above the high-tide line, extending nearly 50 m from the beach. In fact, the length of the groyne
should be 50 per cent longer than that of the beach. The purpose is to capture the sand, which
will otherwise be taken away by the longshore current. The sands that are carried away from
the beach area by the longshore current are stopped on the up-current side. Groynes are very
cost-effective for beach protection as they do not need any maintenance. However, they are
considered detrimental to the aesthetics of the coastline. Moreover, they do not protect the
beach against the storm-driven waves.

Gabion These are boulders and rocks wired into mesh cages. These are usually placed in
front of areas vulnerable to heavy erosion such as cliff edges. Gabions are placed at right
angles to the beach similar to a large groyne of rocks. When the ocean water breaks on the
gabion, the water drains through it leaving the sediments. The rocks and boulders also absorb
a moderate amount of wave energy. Gabions need to be tied properly to prevent abrasion
of wire by rocks or detachment by stretching. Hexagonal mesh wires are better than the
rectangular mesh type.
Breakwater structures Enormous concrete blocks and natural boulders are sunk offshore
to alter wave direction and to fi lter the energy of waves and tides. The waves break further
offshore and therefore reduce their erosive power. This leads to wider beaches, which absorb
the reduced wave energy, protecting the cliff and the settlement behind. The use of enormous
concrete blocks has of late been replaced by several alternative structures that are also resistant
to wave action and require less concrete to produce a superior result.
Building of concrete walls Massive walls of concrete or masonry structures are built in
the shore area to prevent erosion of cliff rocks and sand transportation from the beach and
at places prevent fl ooding of the human settlement from tide during storms. Erection of the
ocean wall normally prevents the destructive action of tidal water and separates the beach
from property and population. However, it may also bring about destruction of the beach. If
a series of storm waves with greater height and more aggressive force than that of normal
waves crashes on the beach, the high walls may be broken down to smaller size. This requires
a new approach for coastal management. Creation of sand dunes and beach restoration are
two new approaches.
Sand dunes These are a natural and effective way of creating a barrier to protect the lives
and property along the shorelines. However, in recent years, coastal communities plant new
dunes hoping to preserve their beaches. There are two prominent ways by which dunes
Chapter_08.indd 170 10/18/2012 9:40:07 PM
Geological Works of Oceans and Coastal Management ● 171
protect the beaches. First, as the waves batter shores and roll up beaches, the dunes provide a
sloping surface for dissipating the wave energy thereby halting the erosion to a great extent.
Second, the dune grass by means of their spread-up roots holds the sand particles together and
prevents erosion. Overall, dunes are relatively inexpensive and are effective in preserving a
beach.
Beach replenishment One of the most popular soft engineering techniques of coastal
management is beach replenishment or nourishment. This involves importing sand off the
beach and piling it on top of the existing sands. The imported sand must be of a similar
quality to the existing beach material so that it can integrate with the natural processes
occurring there, without causing any adverse effects. Beach nourishment can be used
alongside the groyne structures. However, this is a slow and expensive process as sand is
dredged from a near-shore location, transported to the beach to be restored, and pumped
into the beach.
8.9.2 Considerations for Effective Measures of Coastal Protection
As a means of coastal management, after consideration of the different ways of protecting
the coast, it is argued that the following measures will be effective not only in controlling
coastal erosion, but also in reducing the distress of the people living close to coastal
landform:
• Coastal areas in many places are populated by human settlement very close to the shore.
Such human settlements need to be prevented. Planting of trees close to the human habita-
tion in coastal areas protects from degradation of the sandy soil and contains erosion. It is
necessary to grow saline-resistant plants along the coastlines.
• An engineer is to consider the extent of damage that may be caused by littoral drift to de-
sign for remedial measures. There is suffi cient scope for using the natural beach materials
obtained from the littoral drifts for continuous coastal protection along the long extent of
the coastline.
• Use of natural heaps of sand and shingles to make walls is an economical means of absorb-
ing the energy of breaking waves and thus protecting an erodible coastline (Wood and Muir
1969). Hence, this is a useful option to be considered for the protection of coastal areas. Eas-
ily available materials such as clay, sand, and shingles are also worth considering for use as
construction materials for walls. However, concrete is the most constructive material for use
in the retaining walls for coastal protection.
• Growing of mangroves and building concrete sea walls or walls of dense and durable rock
blocks are other methods of saving the coastal landform from the effects of erosion. The sea
walls should be designed based on the maximum probable wave height.
• Construction of walls of rocks or wave breakers not only saves the coast but also serves as
a means of protection frowwm the impacts of tsunami. Depending upon the morphology of
the coast, rock walls can be built as close to the seashore as practicable.
• The modern practice of preventing coastal erosion by the use of groynes should be followed.
They are to be built transverse to the breaking crest of storm waves and anchored at the base
of a suitable bedrock. The beach can be protected by arresting the littoral drift with the use
of groynes or by artifi cially changing the beach. Groynes require anchoring with bedrock for
placing at the required angle to the coastline.
Chapter_08.indd 171 10/18/2012 9:40:08 PM
172 ● Engineering Geology
• Although coastal protection can be achieved by placing groynes to arrest longshore drifts
and retention of shingles at the cliff toe, the most important measure of protection is provid-
ing concrete walls.
• Construction of houses or human habitation by encroachment of the shore should be pre-
vented in the areas vulnerable to inundation or areas affected by tidal action, if required, by
law enforcement.
• In recent times, coastal erosion is prevented by use of geotextile tubes (Stabiplage unit) as
is being done effectively in France for the last two decades (UNESCO 2002). If located
along the coastline, these are very useful in protecting the coast from the impacts of
tsunami.
8.10 CASE STUDY—COASTAL EROSION AT UPPADA ALONG KAKINADA COAST,
ANDHRA PRADESH (PAL AND RAO 2009)
Large-scale coastal erosion is prevalent over the 30-km long coast between Kakinada and
Antarvedi. The impact of the sea erosion at Uppada is so intense that the sea walls and groynes
erected south of it have proved ineffective in protecting the beach road, which is considerably
damaged at several places. More than half of the village, predominantly a fi shermen’s colony,
has gone into the sea. Evidence shows loss of more than 600 acres of coastal land in less than
two months.
Major geomorphic units found in the area include beach ridge, younger beach–dune complex,
older beach ridge, tidal mud fl at, and tidal creek. The most vulnerable geomorphic units are
the long and extensive beach ridge and the younger beach–dune complex because of their
proximity to shore and weak geological formation. The longshore current has caused maximum
erosion to the stable beach bridge and at the same time has widened the mouth of small rivers
draining them in the Bay of Bengal, north of Uppada.
The following are the major causes of coastal hazards.
• Natural causes: Combined action of waves, winds, and tides near shore currents, storms,
slope process, and sea-level rise
• Anthropogenic causes: Dredging of tidal entrance, construction of harbours near shore, con-
struction of groynes, sea walls, and jetties, and destruction of mangroves and other natural
buffers such as beach barrier dunes
The following two preventive and mitigation measures have been proposed.
(a) Structural measures: Construction of sea walls and groynes
(b) Non-structural measures: Vegetation cover and dune stabilization
It was concluded that comprehensive multi-hazard and risk assessment studies with the
participation of local communities and scientists need to be initiated. Sea erosion causing rapid
migration of shoreline towards land and inundation of low-lying fl ats need greater attention in
view of the potential rise of sea level and its impact on communities.

9.1 INTRODUCTION
This chapter deals with the various aspects of subsurface water in relation to their
engineering signifi cance. It discusses the processes involved in hydrological cycle
to maintain the balance of the earth’s water. It describes with illustration the water
table confi guration and its relation to topography and the materials through which
underground water fl ows. The chapter further explains the utility of groundwater and
the method of its withdrawal by pumping water from dug wells in urban and rural
areas in relation to its yield and highlights the hazards of its excessive withdrawal.
The groundwater investigation in alluvial terrain and hard rock areas includes
preparation of groundwater maps and measurement of yields, which are very helpful
in deciphering the groundwater resource of an area for its exploitation. The chapter
also elaborates the harmful effects caused by the presence of underground water in
engineering structures such as dams, tunnels, and underground power houses.
9.2 HYDROLOGICAL CYCLE
Water covers nearly 75 per cent of the earth’s surface. The radiation from the sun
changes the surface water of rivers, lakes, and oceans from liquid to vapour state.
The water vapour rises in the atmosphere and forms clouds and then falls back
on the earth as precipitation in the form of rains, hails, or snow. In this way, the
earth’s water is under continuous circulation between land, atmosphere, and ocean.
This process of movement, exchange, and storage of earth’s water is known as the
hydrological cycle (Fig. 9.1). When the precipitation falls on the land surface, a part

slowly through the subsurface and ultimately
escapes into streams, lakes, and oceans
Fig. 9.1 Hydrological cycle of earth’s water
where evaporation from these water bodies
completes the hydrological cycle. Continuous exchange takes place between the groundwater
and atmosphere during the downward movement of the precipitated water. Transpiration of
plants and respiration of animals also contribute to this process. Plant roots in the soil adsorb a
portion of the water that again enters into the atmosphere by a process called evapotranspiration.
Diagenesis of sediments also has a distinct role to play in the hydrological cycle.
9.3 MODES OF OCCURENCE AND SOURCE OF UNDERGROUND WATER
Water that fl ows along the land surface remains manifested in rivers, lakes, and marshes as
surface water. The water that percolates down and occurs beneath the ground surface occupying
the pores of soil and open fractures of rocks is known as subsurface water or underground water.
The meteoric water, such as rains and that derived from melting of ice or snow, is the main source
from which underground water originates and gets replenished. Water from streams, canals,
lakes, reservoirs, and dams also seeps into the ground and contributes to underground water.
9.3.1 Groundwater and Vadose Water
Surface water percolating down through the top unsaturated zone fi lls the pore spaces of soil
and openings of fractured rocks of the underground region. Thus, a zone of saturation is created
below the ground surface where all pores and voids are completely fi lled with water. The water
that remains in the zone of saturation is termed groundwater. The top surface of the zone of
saturation is called the water table. Above the zone of saturation is the unsaturated zone or
vadose zone. The part of water that remains in the unsaturated zone is called vadose water
(Fig. 9.2).

9.3.2 Juvenile Water and Connate Water
The underground water that originates from molten magma is called juvenile water. The water
that coexists with igneous and sedimentary rocks, since its origin is the connate water. Both
these types of water have their source wholly in deep subterranean region. As such, if the water
table is very deep where the hydrostatic pressure is high, the meteoric water may mix with
juvenile or connate water expelled during compaction. In the hydrological cycle, the sea that
receives water from surface and rains loses part of it not only by evaporation to atmosphere,
but also as connate water to the lithosphere. Finally, the expulsion of the connate water by
diagenesis of sediments completes the hydrological cycle. The gain in the water in the lower
crust as juvenile water is balanced to some extent by loss through the migration of water to a
deeper level in the subduction zone (see Section 20.4).
9.4 FACTORS DECIDING THE CONFIGURATION OF WATER TABLE
The water table is not a fl at surface. It roughly takes the confi guration of the surface relief
(Fig. 9.3). The depth to water table depends upon the nature of the constituent materials,
land slope pattern, and density of precipitation. In general, there is an even water table in
homogeneous, porous, and permeable materials, but it shifts its position as well as level
depending upon the conditions of infi ltration from source water. The confi guration of the water
table can be arrived at by measuring and plotting the water levels in several wells or boreholes
of an area. It will be observed that the highest point in the water level occurs below the peak of
a hill. The lowermost point is generally found to be intersecting the surface near a stream or at
a marshy land. The difference in level between the highest point below a peak and the lowest
point near the stream valley is the hydraulic head.

9.4.1 Fluctuation of Water Table
The water table fl uctuates with the change of seasons. During the rainy season, the water table
of high rainfall areas shows an upward shift due to high infi ltration of surface water. During
dry periods such as summer months, the water table tends to move downward; however, in hilly
terrains where a large quantity of water enters into the ground during summer months from
melting of ice and snow, there is a consequent rise in the water table. In winter months too,
the water table goes down because of less infl ow of water. In plains, however, during drought,
the water table falls appreciably due to discharge of groundwater through springs, wells, and
rivers.
The position of the water table can be measured by taking the level of the standing water
level of a well or a borehole that penetrates down to the zone of saturation. The down-gradient

direction of the water table nearly follows the ground slope, being high beneath the topographic
high and low towards the stream valley. Under the available head, water commonly fl ows at a
slow rate but the rate of fl ow becomes faster near the area of escape to a stream.
The nature of subsurface material or rock strata controls the position of the water table.
In cavernous limestone terrain called karst area, the water table is commonly an irregular
surface. The piezometric head having equal water pressure is measured while investigating the
groundwater behaviour of karstic terrain to plot the position of the water table including the
fl ow pattern of subterranean water. The pattern of the piezometric surface (generally undulating
in nature) in a karst country can be obtained from the measurement of water levels in a number
of boreholes covering a large area. This surface shows an overall down-gradient direction of
underground water fl ow but it does not necessarily follow the topographic slope.
9.4.2 Perched Water Table
In general, in an area, there is only one water table under the ground; however, in some places,
a portion of the meteoric water while moving through the unsaturated zone may remain trapped
as a local body of water above the water table, being surrounded by impervious layers. Such
body of water in an isolated zone of saturation within the unsaturated zone is called the perched
water (Fig. 9.2). The formation of a perched water body depends on the geological conditions
favourable for it. A clay or shale bed is porous but impermeable to water. As such, a pervious
deposit such as sandy soil or sandstone confi ned within shale or clay beds may create a perched
water table. This means there will be one more water table besides the main one. In fact, the
nature of the rock with respect to its permeable property is the main factor in forming the water
table. Thus, several perched water tables may be formed in a thick soil deposit having alternate
layers of impervious and pervious materials obstructing continuous downward movement of
water. A well dug into the zone of perched water may not yield water for a continuous period
as the well can be drained of its water in a short time.
9.5 SOIL WATER
In an area with a thick soil cover, the water that remains inside the voids of the soil is called
the soil water (Fig. 9.4). There are two types of soil water, namely free water and held water.
In the zone of saturation where soil water moves freely under the infl uence of gravity, it is
known as free water. A part of the water while moving through the
unsaturated zone is held in soil pores by attractive forces existing

within the pores. This water called held water occurs in soil pores
in three distinct ways as stated in the following subsections.

tightly bound water by force of adhesion is known as adsorbed waterror hygroscopic water. The
attractive forces within the soil infl uence the behaviour of the adsorbed water but pore water is
free of strong attractive forces. The quantity of adsorbed or hygroscopic water in soil depends
on the nature of the soil particles, topographic confi guration, temperature, and humidity. The
hygroscopic capacity of a soil for a given temperature is expressed by the ratio of adsorbed
moisture from saturated atmosphere to the weight of the oven-dried sample. The coarser the
particles, the lower is the hygroscopic capacity, which is found to be about 1 per cent in sand,
7 per cent in silt, and 17 per cent in clays. Soil possessing adsorbed water has only a limited effect
on engineering structures. The adsorbed water may get accumulated even under pavements and
it may also spread as ice (as fi ne grains) into soil formed by freezing of moist air in frost and
permafrost zones.
9.5.3 Capillary Water
The attractive force of the soil in the unsaturated zone close to the water table causes the
upward movement of water. The pores or interstices of soil act as minute capillary tubes through
which moisture (in the form of water) rises above the water table and fi lls the pore spaces due
to capillary force. This moisture held thus in the soil is called the capillary waterr and the
phenomenon is known as capillary action. The zone directly above the water table in which
water is held by capillary action is the capillary fringe.
The capillary forces that create the zone of capillary water depend on factors such as the
surface tension of water, pressure in water in relation to atmospheric pressure, and size of the
soil pores. In soil mostly with coarse sand, the capillary water rises only a few centimetres
above the water table, but in fi ne-grained (clayey) soil, the rise may be as high as 10 m. The rise
is rapid in coarse-grained soil compared to fi ne-grained soil, where it may take several months
or more than a year to attain maximum rise of capillary water. The capillary water can fully
saturate the ground immediately above the water table, but further up, the soil may be partially
fi lled with vadose water. However, if the water table is shallow and the soil is fi ne grained
facilitating maximum rise of water, the zone above the groundwater table may be completely
fi lled with capillary water.
9.6 CONFINED AND UNCONFINED AQUIFERS
Layers of sediment or rock below the surface that have high porosity and permeability are
called aquifers. Layers of clay or bedrock that are highly impermeable to groundwater are
commonly referred to as aquicludes.
There are mainly two types of aquifers—confi ned and unconfi ned aquifers. In a confi ned
aquifer the saturated zone is capped by a confi ning layer, whereas in the unconfi ned aquifer
there is no confi ning layer on top of the saturated zone. The confi nement or un-confi nement of
the aquifer is based on porosity and permeability—examples being gravel, coarse-to-fi ne sand,
fractured shale, silty and clayey soils. Some good aquicludes are unfractured shales, granite,
and marble.
9.6.1 Aquifer and Aquiclude
Anaquiferr is a water-bearing body formed in the underground by infi ltration of surface water. It
may be found in overburden material or in bedrock that can hold and transmit large quantities of
groundwater. In overburden aquifer, water fi lls the voids of the grains through which it moves.
Chapter_09.indd 179 10/19/2012 12:22:48 PM
180 ● Engineering Geology
In bedrock aquifer, water fi lls and fl ows through the interconnected open spaces due to joints,
faults, fi ssures, and solution cavities in rocks (Fig. 9.3). An overburden aquifer constituted
of gravel and sand can yield a large quantity of water, as the void spaces are large enough to
allow fl ow of large volumes of water. However, when silty and clayey types of soils occur
in the overburden aquifer, the yield of water is poor due to low permeability of the soils. In
general, good water-bearing aquifer occurs in the interface of overburden aquifer and bedrock
aquifer.
The yield of water in a bedrock aquifer depends on the availability of the interconnected
open spaces for movement of underground water. If the bedrock is open jointed, porous,
and permeable, appreciable quantity of water is expected from the aquifer. Sandstones
having voids among the grains and also fracture openings are good aquifers as these hold
and transmit a large volume of water. If an aquifer has its upper limit as the top of the
saturated zone, it is known as an unconfi ned aquifer. In some geological set-ups, an aquifer
may be overlain by clayey material or rocks such as shale through which water cannot
move easily. Such a deposit or layer of rock through which water cannot move easily is
called aquiclude and the underlying aquifer is a confi ned aquifer. A thick clay layer or a
shale bed that is impervious that occurs overlying a porous sandstone aquifer will form an
aquiclude.
9.6.2 Hydrogeological Criteria to Identify Aquifers
Groundwater aquifers occur in both soil (overburden) and rock. In general, overburden
aquifers are the main source of groundwater and they provide a better yield than the
bedrock aquifers. The aquifer sites are identifi ed from the measurements of water table and
the recharge of water in wells in both soils and rocks. The main hydrogeological indicators
of the presence or absence of an aquifer of a place is the nature of the soil and rock
types.
An alluvial country is the best producer of groundwater. Alluvium consists of loosely
compacted sand grains with high porosity and permeability. These sand beds produce the
maximum yield. At places, the sand and silt layers may occur with impervious clay. The
sand layers confi ned within clay layers at places produce perched water bodies that also
supply suffi cient quantity of water. If a well is extended down to the perched water body, the
supply may be for a short period only as the recharge takes time once the trapped water is
exhausted.
Among the rock types, the clastic sedimentary rocks consisting of permeable strata such
as sandstone and conglomerate are good sources of groundwater. Soluble sedimentary rocks
such as limestone, if cavernous, provide a high yield of water. Igneous and metamorphic rocks
are, in general, poor aquifers as the rocks are not capable of storing water, but if the rocks
are intensely joined with interconnected open spaces, they may serve as good aquifers. The
presence of springs, soil moisture, dense vegetation, wetlands, and streams acts as a surface
indicator of the presence of groundwater at a shallow depth. The indirect evidence of the
presence or absence of groundwater in the overburden is provided by the grain size of the
soil, the degree of sorting or gradation, and the percentage of fi nes, whereas the nature of
rock, fracture density, intensity of weathering, and the degree of solubility of rocks decide
the availability of groundwater in rocks. Field measurement of permeability and water
level through wells provide direct evidence about the quantum of yield of groundwater
aquifers.

9.6.3 Artesian Flow and Natural Fountain
Water in a confi ned aquifer is under pressure. The high pressure head is caused by the restricted
movement of water and also due to the weight of the overlying deposits. If a well is dug, water
rises up to a point above the top of the aquifer called the piezometric surface. The water comes
out of the well at the ground surface under pressure. This type of groundwater fl ow is known as
artesian fl ow and the well dug is the artesian well (Fig. 9.5).
The water pressure (piezometric head) of a confi ned aquifer where artesian condition has
developed can be known by measuring the water level using a borehole acting as a piezometer.
The pressure on the surface may be higher than that on the ground surface. This will cause the

water to fl ow out making a natural fountain. The following conditions are necessary for the
existence of an artesian well:
• A confi ned aquifer (say, in sandstone bed) in a dipping or synclinal disposition should be
present.
• The sandstone must receive discharge of water from precipitation in the exposed part that
may be a place far away from the well site.
• The water must move down through the dipping aquifer and accumulate at the bottom so that
hydrostatic pressure is produced as a result of being confi ned between two aquicludes such
as shale beds.
For an aquifer to continuously produce suffi cient quantity of water, it must be replenished
after withdrawal. If the water table occurs at a shallow depth, the unconfi ned aquifer is
recharged from local precipitation. However, in case of confi ned aquifer having artesian
condition, the aquifer is charged with water if there is rainfall in the area where the strata meet
with the surface. The rate of fl ow of underground water is generally slow—only a metre or
so in a day. In case of movement through limestone cavities, the fl ow may take place rapidly
like a surface channel. The duration of water residing underground (resident time) at a place
may be a few days to several months and even hundreds of years. In an unconfi ned aquifer,
where groundwater is available at a shallow depth close to ground surface, a dug well will
supply water, but in confi ned aquifer the well may need to penetrate very deep to withdraw
water.
9.6.4 Springs and Their Origin
Underground water naturally emerging at the surface with some force is called a spring. Springs
appear when the water table intersects the surface with development of swamps or lakes.

(b) along a fault (F-F) separating saturated and unsaturated zones
The course and fl ow rate of a spring depend on the permeability and structure of the materials
through which water moves. Springs are commonly formed from groundwater issuing out from
the interface of saturated and unsaturated zones meeting the ground slope. The captive water in
sandstone is generally found to fl ow down to surface as spring where it is capped by impermeable
rocks such as shale, see Fig. 9.6(a). Such a condition may also develop along a fault cutting
a bedrock aquifer where groundwater will fl ow
out as spring from contact between the saturated
bedrock and the fault zone with impermeable
clay gouge, Fig. 9.6(b). Water moving down from
a perched water table towards a valley slope may
also form springs. Springs are most common in
sandstone, karstic limestone, vesicular lava, and
highly fi ssured or fragmented rocks (Fig. 9.7).
When the temperature of the water of a spring
is more than the yearly average temperature of
the given place, the spring is called a thermal
spring or hot spring. The actual temperature of a

9.7 WATER RETAINING AND TRANSMITTING CAPACITY OF SOIL AND ROCK
Whether a rock mass or soil mass can retain as well as transmit water through it is dependent
on its properties such as porosity and permeability. These two properties of soil and rocks
discussed in the following subsections are important in the study of groundwater resources of
an area.
9.7.1 Porosity of Soil
Porosity is a measure of the capacity of a rock or soil mass to store fl uid in it. It is expressed
as the percentage of the total volume of voids contained in the gross volume of a specimen
of soil or rock. Groundwater saturates porous unconsolidated deposit and fractured bedrock.
River sand and gravel possess high porosity, but when mixed with silt and clay, the porosity
is reduced as these fi ll the spaces between the coarser particles. Graded sands with coarse
and rounded grains are more porous than the poorly sorted sediments with angular grains, see
Fig. 9.8(a) and Fig. 9.8(b).
Chapter_09.indd 182 10/19/2012 12:22:48 PM
Underground Water in Relation to Engineering Works ● 183
Voids of varying dimensions are present in scoriaceous lavas formed from escape of gases,
Fig. 9.8(c) and also in soluble rocks such as limestone by formation of caverns, Fig. 9.8(d).
In some igneous and metamorphic rocks free from weathering and fractures, porosity is almost
nil because of the tightly woven minerals. In sedimentary rocks, the pore spaces are dependent
on compaction or packing during formation of the strata and also on cementing materials and
grain size. Clastic sedimentary rocks such as conglomerate and coarse-grained sandstone may
have very high porosity due to large intergranular voids. Most signifi cant open spaces are
associated with rock structures such as folds, faults, and joints. A weathered product of rock,
called regolith, possesses high porosity.

Fig. 9.8 Porosity in different types of soils and rocks: (a) high porosity in well-sorted sand;
(b) poor porosity in poorly sorted sand; (c) porosity due to voids in scoriaceous lava; and
(d) porosity in cavernous limestone
The average values of porosity and permeability of unconsolidated materials are shown in
Table 9.1.

Coarse sand 30–50 10-1–10-3
Fine sand and silt 40–50 10-3–10-5
Clay and silty clay 35–55 10-5–10-9
9.7.2 Permeability and Its Relation to Porosity
Permeability is the transmitting capacity of the water. The rate of groundwater movement and
quantity of water that can be pumped out from underground through wells are known from
the determination of permeability of soil or rock through which water fl ows. Permeability of
unconsolidated gravels and sand deposits is very high. Clay, though has high porosity, is low
in permeability. In bauxite (a rock used as aluminium ore), there are numerous void spaces, but
they are not interconnected and as such the rock is impermeable. Rocks subjected to faulting
and intense jointing provide suffi cient open spaces for water to fl ow and as such these rocks
are permeable to a great extent. A non-porous and less-fractured rock has low porosity and
low permeability. Limestone without solution effect and crystalline (igneous) rocks are of this
category. However, soluble limestone with interconnected cavities exhibits high permeability
and allows fl ow of large quantities of water. Coarse-grained sandstone, pebble stone, and
Chapter_09.indd 183 10/19/2012 12:22:48 PM
184 ● Engineering Geology
conglomerate generally exhibit high permeability, but if the pore spaces are fi lled with mineral
matter, the permeability is reduced. Pumping tests are conducted through boreholes to measure
the rate of groundwater fl ow through subsoil and subsurface rock mass (see Section 11.8).
9.8 GROUNDWATER MOVEMENT
Groundwater fl ows from higher elevation to lower elevation due to potential energy derived
from the gravity. During its downward fl ow, groundwater roughly follows the slope of the
water table. If the water table of a region is represented by a contour map, the movement of
groundwater will be from higher to lower contour direction until its escape to a lower valley. The
water fi nally fl ows towards the discharge area. A stream valley or a lake is the ideal discharge
area of groundwater. The deeper parts of the water table correspond roughly to the stream level.
Groundwater pressure controls the rate and direction of fl ow in confi ned aquifers (artesian
condition). At higher depth, the hydraulic pressure is high. As such, the meteoric water may
mix with the connate water or juvenile water.
The pattern of the underground fl ow is controlled by the geological structures. The orientation
of joints, fractures, faults, and folds with porous and non-porous rock layers are important
structures that guide the fl ow pattern. Groundwater can move only through interconnected open
spaces. The permeability of a sedimentary rock may be affected if interrupted by other non-
porous and impermeable rocks. In accordance with Darcy’s law, the rate of fl ow of water in an
aquifer depends on both the hydraulic head and the capacity of the aquifer to transmit by any
mechanism. The rate of groundwater fl ow (hydraulic conductivity) is very high through the
interconnected open spaces of the fractured and highly porous rocks such as sandstone and the
voids in gravel and sand deposits. Conversely, rocks such as shale and clay deposits have very
poor water-transmitting capacity.
Tracers or dyes of various types are used to measure the direction and gradient of groundwater
fl ow. From the middle of the last century, tritium in groundwater derived from rain water is being
used as a tracer. Nuclear devices (e.g., Hiroshima bombing) in the middle of the last century
increased the tritium content in water. Tritium concentrates have been used to investigate the
rate of recharge of aquifer, where recharge is due to the entry of rain water from adjacent strata.
Tracer study using environmental tritium was carried out in karstic limestone of Kopili project
in Meghalaya (see Section 22.5).
9.9 SYSTEMATIC GROUNDWATER INVESTIGATION
Geological Survey of India fi rst started the systematic groundwater investigation covering large
parts of the country. Currently, Central Ground Water Board conducts systematic survey of
groundwater throughout India. Such activities are oriented towards a comprehensive study
of the groundwater regimes in different geohydrological zones controlled by geomorphic,
geological, and tectonic environments.
9.9.1 Basin-wise Study
The main objectives of groundwater study include the following:
• Identifi cation of aquifers and preparation of water table maps for the various seasons,
assessment of the groundwater recharge, and determination of the chemical characteristics
of the groundwater
• Study of the relation between surface water and groundwater
Chapter_09.indd 184 10/19/2012 12:22:48 PM
Underground Water in Relation to Engineering Works ● 185
• Determination of the hydraulic characteristics of aquifers
• Study of the problem of saline water invasion into aquifers in the coastal areas
The investigation of the groundwater resources was initially taken up in alluvial areas such as
all the major river basins and sub-basins, but now the study has been extended covering the entire
country including the hard rock regions. A drilling unit is attached to help exploratory work and
several regional chemical laboratories take up analysis of water samples. Several hydrograph
stations are set up to measure the seasonal water level fl uctuations throughout the country.
9.9.2 Groundwater in Hard Rock Areas
A large part of India is covered by hard rocks in which the occurrence of groundwater is
controlled by factors different from those of the alluvial and unconsolidated sediments. In hard
rocks, groundwater occurs mainly in the top mantle of weathered rocks and also in the open
spaces of interconnected joints, fractures, and solution cavities. All igneous and metamorphic
rocks and compacted sedimentary formations are included in hard rock terrains. Based on the
lithology and structure, hard rocks can be divided into the following four categories in which
occurrence of groundwater is controlled by distinctive features:
(i) Crystalline and intrusive rocks such as granite, gneiss, schist, and quartzite
(ii) Effusive lava fl ows (the trap rocks)
(iii) Compact sedimentary formations such as the Cuddapah and Vindhyan rocks and compact
sedimentaries of the Himalayas
(iv) Carbonate rocks (e.g., limestone) that often undergo solution to form cavities
In all the four types, groundwater is present in different quantities in the zones of weathering
and fracturing. However, the effusive rocks with ‘red boles’ and inter-trappean beds (under
category (ii)) and the carbonate rocks such as limestone and dolomite with solution channels
(under category (iv)) have the largest groundwater resources among hard rocks. Groundwater
studies for the hard rock terrains include the understanding of the tectonic framework of the
region, the inherent physical features of the rocks controlling weathering, depth and lateral
extension of weathering, and geochemical characteristics of groundwater available from the
zones of weathering and fracturing.
9.9.3 Groundwater Maps
Groundwater maps are prepared showing many features such as depth to water table, yield,
and quality of water in aquifers. In systematic groundwater survey, the depth to water table of a
site with respect to surface (parapet level) is measured from dug wells or boreholes. If several
such wells or boreholes are available covering a large area, the measurement of water levels
throughout the year will show the fl uctuation in the groundwater level. In boreholes, the water
table is measured by inserting piezometric tubes when the nature of water bearing strata and
the existence of artesian condition are also recorded. The water table is generally found to be
at a shallow depth during rainy season and at a comparatively deeper level in the summer and
winter months.
The data collected by measuring the water table from wells or boreholes helps to prepare
the water table contour maps of the terrain showing seasonal variations. The contours plotted
for water levels will represent a curved surface and may be similar to the overlying ground
confi guration. Water fl ows from the higher contour level towards down-gradient direction until
it escapes to a stream, lake, or swamp. As the water table fl uctuates with seasonal changes in
Chapter_09.indd 185 10/19/2012 12:22:48 PM
186 ● Engineering Geology
precipitation, such maps are prepared for the dry period as well as for the period of maximum
rainfall. The measurement of groundwater is, therefore, continued round the year. Such maps
and yield measurements are of immense help in the planning and management of groundwater
for the purpose of drinking and irrigation. These maps also help in deciphering problems at
construction sites and adopting remedial measures.
9.10 UTILITY, YIELD, WITHDRAWAL, AND ARTIFICIAL RECHARGE OF GROUNDWATER
Man cannot live without water. Groundwater is stated to be the gift of nature to man. Over
90 per cent of world’s fresh water is available from groundwater that occurs in most areas in
overburden or bedrock aquifers. Groundwater is used for many purposes such as drinking and
other domestic purposes and irrigation of agricultural lands, as well as in the industrial units. As
the water moves through the soil, it gets fi ltered and purifi ed. Surface water available in streams
and lakes may be easily contaminated and requires treatment and long transportation before
being used for drinking purposes.
Groundwater is not easily contaminated and can be used safely in most places as drinking
water just by tapping through wells. The quality of the groundwater is, however, dependent
on the nature of material or bedrock through which it fl ows in the underground region and
also on the pH value (hydrogen ion content) and Eh (oxidation–reduction) condition. During
its passage through bedrocks or overburden aquifers, groundwater is enriched with minerals
such as calcium, magnesium, and iron by solution from aquifer materials. When groundwater
comes from a deeper part, sometimes by infl ux of juvenile water, the water contains more of the
dissolved minerals good for health.
9.10.1 Uses in Urban and Rural Areas
Groundwater is used in both urban and rural areas. The most common method of groundwater
development in India is the dug well and to a lesser extent dug-cum-bored well. Many cities and
small towns meet their need of water supply from underground water combined with surface
water. Groundwater is withdrawn by pumping through deep wells. Withdrawal and supply of
groundwater do not need costly treatment as in surface water. In plain areas, groundwater is
used for irrigation purpose as it is easy to withdraw from ground by simply pumping from the
area of irrigation without involving any transportation cost. Groundwater is also used in some
industrial units for cooling purposes of machinery and industrial processes. Groundwater is a
better choice for industrial use as it maintains a uniform temperature and uniform quality when
obtained from an area. Though all variants of groundwater contain mineral matters dissolved
from soil or rock through which it fl ows, its quality and temperature, which remain constant at
a given source, make it more desirable for industrial development.
Groundwater resources are of enormous value to the people of India where large sections
of the population live in villages in the plains. They get their supply of drinking water from
dug wells or tube wells. These water wells are simply tubes or shafts dug to a depth below the
water table. The dug wells may range from about a metre to as much as 10 m in diameter. In
general, shallow wells restricted to 5–30 m in depth obtain groundwater, but in some dry areas
the wells may have to penetrate deeper to meet the water table. These water wells are infl uenced
by gravity fl ow in which the discharge comes from groundwater zone surrounding the well.
Even after withdrawing water, the wells tend to maintain the level with the surrounding areas.
All gravity wells, however, show seasonal fl uctuations in water level and may dry up during
summer.

9.10.2 Yield in Different Parts of India
In rocky areas, wells in weathered and jointed rocks may yield from about 22,500 litres to as
much as 450,000 litres per day. In general, the yield is restricted to 100,000–150,000 litres
per day. These wells may irrigate from a hectare to ten hectares of land. Many towns in hard
rock areas also receive water supply from dug wells or dug-cum-bored wells of rocky terrains.
Alluvial terrains are, however, the largest suppliers of groundwater. In the Ganges basin of West
Bengal, aquifers at a depth of 150 m from surface yield groundwater to an extent of 100,000–
200,000 litres per hour. Aquifers occurring even at a depth around 300 m may supply a large
quantity of groundwater. Tube wells tapping artesian aquifers recorded in parts of Kashmir
valley may yield around 22,500 litres per hour. In Punjab within the Sindh basin, the yield from
100 m deep tube wells is up to about 180,000 litres per hour (Niyogi and Seth. 1972).
9.10.3 Cone of Depression
A cone of depression is formed as a result of withdrawal of water by pumping from an aquifer
through a well (Fig. 9.9). The pumping rate and the permeability of the aquifer material
decide the shape of the cone. Continuous drawing of water by pumping from the well causes
progressive drawdown and increase in the cone of depression. The difference in height between
the normal water table and the water surface is the measure of the drawdown. If the withdrawal
is reduced, the drawdown decreases when the water surface moves up with recharge. However,
after a critical limit of drawdown due to excessive withdrawal, the water level remains standing
without further rise in level. Heavy pumping of underground water may result in such a
condition, and as such pumping from wells should be limited so that recharge does not suffer.

While using underground water from a well for drinking purpose, care should be taken that
the water is not polluted. Shallow dug wells may get polluted from surface pollutants trickling in
during rains. Waste products dumped in the areas surrounding wells are also potential source of
danger of polluting the water. The most prolifi c effect of chemical pollution due to the presence
of arsenic in water has been recorded from various parts of West Bengal including the capital city
of Kolkata and its neighbouring regions. Serious skin diseases have been reported from the use of
groundwater where arsenic is present even in traces beyond the threshold value. It is not easy to
remove this chemical from the water, and as such arsenic-contaminated water should not be used
for drinking or domestic purposes. Of late, water treatment plants have been installed in some
selected places to remove arsenic from water and make it suitable for drinking purposes.

9.10.4 Environmental Degradation
Excessive withdrawal of groundwater by pumping through wells may create problems of land
subsidence and other environmental degradation. Several instances of this problem can be
found in different parts of India. In Farrukhabad district of Uttar Pradesh, excessive withdrawal
of groundwater from shallow aquifers of the Gangetic alluvium has led to the development
of piezometric pressure and reduction in volume of subsoil causing ground subsidence and
cracking of ground and even minor damage of the dwellings (Pande 1999).
Over the years, expansion of cities with construction of multi-storeyed building complexes has
generated a greater demand of water that is being met through overdrawing of groundwater by
digging deep wells. This has caused serious drawdown of the water table endangering the stability
of buildings. Sandy and silty soil, wherever it becomes unsaturated by the drawdown, is likely to
get compressed under the load of overlying buildings causing their deformation. Kolkata, located
on the Gangetic alluvium, has faced such problems of deformation and tilting of some buildings
from excessive use of groundwater by sinking deep tube wells. This is, however, not a groundwater
problem but a man-made problem that can be solved by a balanced use of groundwater.
9.10.5 Artifi cial Recharge
Artifi cial recharge is the planned effort of augmenting the depleting groundwater resources
through works designed to increase natural replenishment or ensure percolation of surface
water into the groundwater aquifers. The benefi cial purposes include rainwater harvesting and
conservation or disposal of fl oodwater, control of saltwater intrusion, storage of water to reduce
pumping cost, and improvement of water quality by removing suspended solids by the process of
fi ltration through the ground. The method of artifi cial recharge also has application in wastewater
treatment, prevention of land subsidence, storage of fresh water, and crop development. The
method applied in artifi cial recharge may be grouped into the following four categories:
(i) Direct surface recharge
(ii) Direct subsurface recharge
(iii) Combination of surface and subsurface method
(iv) Indirect artifi cial recharge
In the direct surface method, water is allowed to move to the groundwater aquifer directly
from land surface by percolation through the soil. In the direct subsurface recharge method,
water enters directly into an aquifer. Recharged water passes into the aquifer without the
fi ltration or oxidation that occurs when water percolates through the unsaturated zone. Recharge
wells are generally used to replenish groundwater when aquifers are deep and separated from
land surface by materials of low permeability. Recharge wells are used to dispose of industrial
wastewater and to add freshwater to coastal aquifers.
In the combination of surface and subsurface method, the two methods are applied in
conjunction with each other to meet specifi c needs of recharge. In the indirect method of
artifi cial recharge, infi ltration gallery pumping stations are installed near the water bodies
such as streams or lakes. The process involves lowering of groundwater level and allowing
infi ltration into the drainage basin to enhance groundwater reserve. Groundwater barriers or
dams are also built within river beds in many places to obstruct and detain groundwater fl ows
so as to sustain the storage capacity of the aquifer and to meet the water demand when needed.
This method, however, has less control on the quantity and quality of the water than the
direct method. If an aquifer contains poor quality water, this can be cleansed by means of
artifi cial recharge. This is done by increasing the oxygen and reducing the carbon dioxide

content. The quality of water in the groundwater aquifer can also be improved by allowing
infi ltration of accumulating rainwater after heavy downpour or fl ood water into the aquifer.
Groundwater aquifer is also cleansed by means of transferring surface water through natural
sand infi ltration to re-originate the water. In India, the method of artifi cial recharge, irrespective
of the quality, provides reliable irrigation facility for cultivators in rural areas.
9.10.6 Saltwater Intrusion in Groundwater
Sea water moving inland is called saltwater intrusion. Alternatively, mineral-bearing beds
containing salt may leach into groundwater to create salinity of fresh underground water. In fact,
mixing of freshwater and saline water may take place in different ways. In areas close to sea, salt
water may intrude on fresh water causing contamination. It may also happen that part of salt water
in certain parts of subsurface regions is enriched by fresh water, which overrides and displaces the
salt water. In coastal areas, it is also observed that a water body is in equilibrium with fresh water
that fl oats over the salt water. This feature is known as Ghyben–Herzberg balance (Krynine and
Judd, 1957). The equilibrium condition is lost due to pumping while drawing groundwater from
this part resulting in contamination of groundwater by intermixing of fresh and salt water.
9.11 GROUNDWATER PROVINCE AND HAZARDS OF USING ITS WATER
A groundwater province or basin is the underground water reservoir or aquifer extending over
large areas having distinct hydrological and geological boundaries. It is generally diffi cult to
determine where the exact boundary of a groundwater province lies. In certain cases, however,
there is a defi nite geological boundary such as a deposit of sedimentary formation, which
gives a clear understanding of the aquifer with its ends. A groundwater province may be very
large like the alluvium of the Ganges or it may occur as long but narrow underground channel
or buried channel having suffi cient fl ow of water. In a groundwater basin, water may fl ow
like a surface stream. The slope of such fl ow can be known from measuring the water table
at different places of the basin through boreholes and dug wells and then preparing a contour
map of water table (see Section 9.13) such as a structure contour map covering the entire basin
area. The direction of surface of higher contour to lower contour indicates the direction of
groundwater movement.
The aquifer systems that have formed large and distinct groundwater provinces of India
include extensive alluvium, alluvium and sandstone combined, limestone with solution cavities,
crystalline rocks having joints and fractures, and trap basalts. According to Taylor (1959), India
has eight groundwater provinces on hydrological evidence as follows:
(i) Precambrian crystalline province
(ii) Precambrian sedimentary province
(iii) Gondwana sedimentary province
(iv) Deccan trap province
(v) Cenezoic sedimentary province
(vi) Cenezoic fault province
(vii) Ganges–Brahmaputra–Indus alluvial province
(viii) Himalayan highland province
India’s main groundwater provinces cover the Ganges–Brahmaputra and Himalayan region,
each constituting a single province. The rocks of the Himalayan high mountain region are,
however, not conducive to creating good groundwater aquifers. The Babars and Trais of the
Himalayas act as a potential groundwater recharge zone for the aquifer systems downhill.
Chapter_09.indd 189 10/19/2012 12:22:49 PM
190 ● Engineering Geology
The deeper confi ned aquifers in these formations show fl owing artesian conditions. The Indo-
Gangetic alluvium occurring in the Himalayan fore-deep forms the most productive and
extensive multi-aquifer system of India. The sedimentary formations of Gondwana and tertiary
sedimentary deposits are also productive groundwater aquifers. The porosity and permeability
characteristics provided by open joints and fi ssures in the Deccan basalt and Precambrian
crystalline rocks have created groundwater aquifer systems in these hard rocks.
There are chances of contamination of water in a groundwater province. While investigating
an aquifer for groundwater, it will be known whether the water is contaminated or it is safe
to use the water. Contaminated surface water may infi ltrate into groundwater and pollute it.
Industrial waste products (even nuclear waste) may percolate and contaminate groundwater.
Pollutants released from the ground can go down into the groundwater thus adding the harmful
pollutants into the aquifer.
In many cases, the hazard is dependent of the geology of the basin. Stratigraphy of an
area plays an important part in transporting pollutants. Cracks are developed in the ground
due to earthquakes that create avenues for the entrance of surface water with pollutants and
contamination with groundwater. Careful consideration is necessary before supplying water to
people for drinking, agriculture, and irrigation purposes. In case the water is contaminated, it
is necessary to process the water for purifi cation. However, in some cases, the water may go
beyond the usable limit when alternative water supply is needed for the people.
If there is substantial bacteria content in the surface material (e.g., where a sewage disposal
problem exists), the percolated water from the surface will lead to change in the components of
groundwater. Microbial dissolution of iron oxide from the mineral constituent of groundwater
basin rock may cause release of arsenic from the strata, which remains dissolved in water
and causes arsenic pollution of water. Humans may develop serious skin and other diseases if
such water is used for drinking or other purposes. Such arsenic contamination in groundwater
aquifers and people suffering from its use are very widespread in rural areas of West Bengal
and parts of Bangladesh.
Overutilization of water from aquifers of groundwater basins beyond the capacity of recharge
is another concern. People consume more quantity of water than the aquifer can recharge,
and as a result a water shortage may develop. As such, in the investigation of a project for
groundwater aquifer, it is necessary to fi nd how much water is available and how much can be
safely used from the aquifer and suggest the project authority accordingly.
9.12 INFLUENCE OF UNDERGROUND WATER IN ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTIONS
Problems created by groundwater in areas of dams, reservoirs, and other engineering structures
are numerous. The problems become acute if the rocks are fractured and soluble in nature. The
following subsections give a picture of groundwater effect in the sites of major engineering
structures.
9.12.1 Dams and Reservoirs
In the case of an earth embankment, capillary rise in water may saturate the soil below the earthen
structure, thus reducing its bearing strength. In addition, seepage pressure of groundwater fl ow
may take place below an earthen structure. The combined effect may even cause failure of the
structure. As a remedy, the earthen structure may have to be placed below the zone of capillary
action. The soil below the structure is required to be compressed to an extent as though an
equivalent external load is placed on the surface of the soil mass.
Chapter_09.indd 190 10/19/2012 12:22:49 PM
Underground Water in Relation to Engineering Works ● 191
Fractured rocks, faults, and shear zones and folded strata with tension joints are the structural
features in rocks that provide path to movement of groundwater, which emerges as seepage
through areas near dams and reservoirs. The confi guration of the water table changes with the
gradual fi lling of a reservoir. Under full reservoir condition, the water table rises to the upper
surfaces where the material may be highly porous and permeable or bedrock may be faulted.
The new condition may result in an excessive seepage or leakage of impounded water. Rise in
groundwater level exerts more pressure on the pores or spaces within an already saturated rock,
and this may create a new situation wherein leakage may take place. The sides of the reservoir
under the new condition become vulnerable to slide.
If porous sandstones alternating with shales occur by the side of a reservoir, it may cause
a problem of slide under the new condition when bedrock becomes saturated. Seepage takes
place through the interface of sandstone and shale. The condition becomes more prolifi c if an
unsaturated material exists along the side overlying a crystalline rock. The percolating water
reduces the strength of the shale beds that become unstable. Such unstable beds create a danger
of sliding. The hydraulic gradient of the reservoir changes and poses leakage problem of stored
water to adjoining valleys.
Underground water circulating in soluble rocks creates solution cavities of different
dimensions. When such a feature of cavity formation in limestone is very prolifi c, it results in
karst condition in underground limestone through which a large volume of water may escape
from a reservoir after it is fi lled with water. The cavities previously fi lled with soil or other
materials are washed away making paths for the fl ow of water through the solution cavities.
In some places, the fl ow of water through the underground cavities is like a channel when
the entire reservoir may become dry. Such leakage may also take place below a dam or its
abutments if fi ssures and solution cavities occur. Occurrence of widespread solution cavities
may create a problem of leakage in storage dams in a limestone terrain and its remedy lies in the
proper identifi cation of the cavities and then resorting to commensurate treatment.
9.12.2 Road Pavements and Soil Slopes
Movement of water through the soil mass may
cause a pavement’s failure. Water may be drawn
in a pavement by capillary action or infi ltrated
through cracks into the subgrade soil beneath a
road pavement or runway. The accumulated water
reduces the bearing capacity of the soil. As a result,
the pavement may subside or get deformed due to
wheel movement (Fig. 9.10). One simple solution
is to remove the material prone to capillary action
and backfi ll the portion with granular material.
Another approach is to provide a layer of soil to
the pavement structure unaffected by capillary
action. Seepage of water through soil mass or
fractured rock of a land slope or open-cut may
cause erosion or its failure. To control the effect,

the design of the pavement requires provision of
seepage water beneath the road pavement and later
adequate drainage of the subsoil so that seepage

Bengal pressure does not build up.

192 ● Engineering Geology
Retaining structures with drainage by weep holes are provided to protect the slope from
groundwater hazards. Highways or runways constructed in areas with water table close to the
ground surface face problems from capillary water or seepage of water that reduces the strength
of the structure. The control measure lies in lowering the water table by excavating side trenches.
The problem is also tackled by building the road or runway on a shallow fi ll (sand blanket)
about a metre above the ground surface that prevents capillary action (see Section 19.2.2).
9.12.3 Problems in Tunnelling
Groundwater brings about acute problems in tunnelling. A dry tunnel is relatively safe, but
when the tunnel passes through zones saturated with water the condition aggravates. Folds,
faults, and joints are common structural problems. The problem is intensifi ed many times when
the divisional planes are fi lled with water, as saturation with water weakens the shear strength
of the rock. Such water-bearing zones in structurally weak rocks, if present in a tunnel, may
cause collapse of the tunnel.
The presence of underground water can be known by measuring the depth of water table
along the tunnel alignment through boreholes keeping piezometers at least for a year during the
investigation stage. The groundwater study helps to decipher the nature of probable water fl ow
into the tunnel under the tunnelling condition. It is not only the water but also the loose materials
that may rush into the tunnel that are of concern. In Barapani tunnel in Meghalaya, the infl ow of
groundwater along with sand rush had completely choked the tunnel. As a result, tunnelling work
remained suspended for several months until the dry season when the sandy material was removed
and the tunnel was thickly lined before resuming the work (Gangopadhyay 1971). It was necessary
to use high-power pump for dewatering during tunnelling. The fractured rocks through which water
fl ows were required to be grouted and lining provided to stop tunnel collapse. Grouting reduced
the infl ow even though initially it could not be stopped completely, increasing further workability.
9.12.4 Water Retaining Structures
The confi guration of the water table and its relationship to the ground surface are very signifi cant
aspects in the construction of water retaining structures. The surface water (e.g., rains) percolates
through the unsaturated zones and reaches the zone of groundwater, but at places it comes out
as seepage water or gush out as spring if it gets an avenue through the ground. The interface of
the ground and the spring marks the position (level) of the water table. With the construction
of a reservoir, there will be a tendency of the stored water to seep out if the bedrock material
of the reservoir is porous and permeable. In such a case, the land where seepage takes place
becomes generally swampy. In rainy season, the swampy land becomes fi lled with water, but
in dry periods, when the water table goes down, these swamps get dried up.
9.13 CASE STUDY ON GROUNDWATER PROBLEMS AND THEIR SOLUTION
The knowledge of groundwater and water table maps are helpful in solving engineering and
mining problems. During the construction of Bansagar dam in Madhya Pradesh, it was observed
that the proposed reservoir in karstic terrain was likely to create fl ooding of the open-cast mine
of steel grade limestone used in the Bhilai Plant. The Central Ground Water Board carried out
a detailed investigation of the groundwater condition in limestone of the area; this included
the preparation of a hydrogeological map of the limestone terrain to decide the suitability of
locating the reservoir. Groundwater levels were measured through several dug wells and drill
holes using them as piezometers.

may be seen in the map, the study indicated two distinct groundwater systems in the limestone
(Kajrahat limestone) occurring in the right bank of the dam. System A exhibited deep karstifi cation
and copious fl ow of groundwater. System B showed the presence of massive limestone with
general absence of solution cavities down to 80 m with meagre discharge, Fig. 9.11(b).

After consideration of the limestone condition of the reservoir area, it was planned to take
up corrective measures. Accordingly, along the dividing ground of this zone, a 6 m-deep and
1.5 km-long grout curtain was provided as a precautionary measure against submergence
by underground fl ow. In addition, a contour bund was raised around the mining area. Thus,
knowledge of the groundwater condition helped in taking protective measures to save the mine
from submergence from reservoir water (Romani 1999).

10.1 INTRODUCTION
This chapter deals with the methods of quantitative evaluation of rock properties and
the elastic and plastic behaviour of rocks under stress. It explains with illustration the
various types of instruments used for determining the strength properties of intact
rocks and rock mass. The chapter elucidates different approaches for estimating the
rock quality designation. It also explains the rock mass classifi cation according to the
Norwegian Geotechnical Institute (NGI), as well as the geomechanics classifi cation
giving examples of their uses to identify the support requirement of underground
engineering structures. It further describes the method of calculation of geological
strength index (GSI) of tectonically disturbed rocks such as the Himalayan terrain
using the two tables provided.
10.2 RELEVANCE OF ROCK MECHANICS IN EVALUATING ROCK AND
ROCK MASS PROPERTIES
The study of the physical characteristics and mechanical behaviour of rocks
in response to the forces imposed on them comes under the purview of rock
mechanics. Application of the principles of rock mechanics is necessary in
engineering geological works related to civil engineering structures, for example,
concrete and masonry dams, tunnels, and underground powerhouses that are built
in or of rocks.
Chapter_10.indd 196 10/27/2012 2:00:45 PM
Applications of Rock Mechanics in Engineering Geology ● 197
‘The engineering geologist must recognize that for his work to be of maximum benefi t to
the design engineer, it will be necessary for the engineering geologist to quantify his fi ndings.
That is, engineering geologic results must not only be presented in a descriptive form that
is understandable by the engineer, but the engineer now is requesting numerically defi ned
limits for engineering geologic description’, was the message of Judd (1969) in the inaugural
ceremony of the symposium on the role of rock mechanics in engineering geology held in India
in 1968. In fact, knowledge of rock mechanics is necessary in engineering geological works
to understand the behaviour of rocks under force fi eld and to estimate the rock properties in
quantitative terms for engineering design.
The science of rock mechanics is based on the engineering principles used in the analysis of
rock and rock mass for engineering purposes. Rocks are used for engineering purposes mainly
in two ways—one as construction material involving only intact rocks and, two, as foundation
to engineering structures on rock mass. Road metals, railway ballasts, concrete aggregates,
cut-stones, masonry works, support columns, and beams are only few of many instances of
engineering use of varied sizes of intact rocks as construction materials.
Construction of heavy structures such as high-rise buildings and concrete dams needs
a foundation of fi rm in-situ rocks. The quantitative values of rock properties derived by
conducting various tests on intact rocks and measurement of relevant features in rock mass
fi nd importance in the engineering analysis of foundation condition, design of slopes, and
underground excavation in rocks.
In case the rocks are used as construction
materials, intact rock specimens are taken from
the fi eld site and tested for determination of
rock properties in a laboratory set-up. Several
instruments are also available to measure the
strength properties of intact rocks in the fi eld
itself (Fig. 10.1). However, it is the rock mass
properties that are important to engineers and
involve the determination of the bulk strength
properties for foundation of engineering
structures and excavation purposes.
The rock mass properties are in a way
controlled by planes of discontinuities and weak
structural features of rocks including faults,
fractures, joints, bedding planes, foliation
planes, and clay seam. Field measurements
of the geological parameters related to these
planes of discontinues and other weak features
are the main considerations along with the
analytical data of laboratory tests on rock
specimens in estimating rock mass properties.
Wherever needed for design purposes, rock
mass properties such as bearing strength of
foundation rock and stress condition of rocks
at depths are measured by in-situ instrumental

198 ● Engineering Geology
This chapter deals with the basic aspects of rock mechanics such as quantitative evaluation
of the properties of intact rocks as well as in-situ rocks or rock mass having relevance in the
construction of surface and subsurface engineering structures with which engineering geological
works are closely associated. Brief descriptions of such instruments including their functions
are also provided in this chapter.
10.3 DETERMINATION OF COMMON PROPERTIES OF ROCKS
The common rock properties such as specifi c gravity, porosity, void ratio, and absorption can be
determined in a laboratory set-up with an oven, an accurate balance, and some glassware. Brief
descriptions of the testing procedures for determining these rock properties in intact specimens
are given in the following subsections.
10.3.1 Specifi c Gravity
Specifi c gravity of a rock specimen is defi ned as the ratio of the weight of the specimen at
a given temperature to the weight of an equal volume of water (that weighs1gm/cm3). The
procedure to determine the specifi c gravity in the laboratory is as follows:
The specimen is oven-dried for 24 hours and cooled, and its weight (W ) is taken. It is then
0
soaked in distilled water for 24 hours and its weight (W ) is noted. Finally, the specimen is
w
immersed in water and its weight (W) is taken under suspended condition.
s
The specifi c gravity (G) of the rock specimen is then given by
WWW
G = 0 (10.1)
WWW WWW
w s
The specifi c gravity thus obtained is the apparent specifi c gravity of the rock. In igneous and
metamorphic rocks—in which the pore spaces are negligible—the apparent specifi c gravity is
almost the same as the true specifi c gravity. However, in a porous sedimentary rock, the apparent
specifi c gravity will vary to a certain extent depending upon the volume of pore spaces. The
true specifi c gravity of a rock specimen can be obtained by powdering the specimen and then
following the method described under ‘specifi c gravity’ for soil (see Section 6.3).
10.3.2 Density
Density is defi ned as the mass per unit volume. The density ( r) of a rock specimen is derived
by dividing the weight of the specimen by its volume. Density is determined in the same way
as specifi c gravity, that is, by measuring the dry weight (W ), water-saturated weight (W ), and
0 w
water-suspended weight (W). However, unlike the specifi c gravity, which is a dimensionless

number, density has a unit and can be expressed as follows:
WWW
r = 0 gm/cm2 (10.2)
WWW −WWW
w s
Thus, the density of a material is the same as the specifi c gravity when expressed in metric
units. The specifi c gravity of granite is 2.68, its density is 2.68 gm/cm3 = 2680 kg/m3 =
2.68 tonnes/m3.
Density may be of the following different types:
• Dry density, r is the weight of dry specimen with pores free of water/unit volume.
d
• Saturated density, r is the weight of the specimen soaked in water/unit volume.
s

• Grain density, r is the weight of the powdered sample/unit volume.
g
• Bulk density, r is the weight of the specimen with pores partially fi lled/unit volume.
b
In a porous sedimentary rock, saturated density varies to a great extent from dry density
due to pore spaces. The strength of a rock also reduces when its density is reduced due to the
presence of void spaces.
10.3.3 Unit Weight
In civil engineering works, it is desirable to use the term ‘unit weight’, which is the same as
density when expressed in the unit of metric system. Thus, unit weight of basalt (G = 2.65 or
r = 2.65 gm/cm3) is 2.65 gm/cm3 or 2650 kg/m3.
In English system of measurement as used in the US, unit weight is expressed as pound
(lb) per cubic feet (ft3). The unit weight of a rock sample is derived by multiplying the specifi c
gravity of the sample by the density of water, that is, 62.4lb/ft3. Thus, the unit weight of basalt
(G = 2.65) in English system of measurement will be (2.65 × 62.4lb/ft3) = 165 lb/ft3.
10.3.4 Porosity
Porosity (h) of a rock specimen is the volume of voids contained in it and is expressed as the
percentage of the gross volume (V ) of the specimen. In the determination of porosity, if a rock
specimen of regular shape is used, the volume (V ) can be directly measured. A rock cube or a
rock core with parallel cutting of two ends is generally used to facilitate direct measurement of
volume. The specimen is fi rst oven-dried for 24 hours at a temperature of 105°C and then its
weight (W ) is taken. It is then kept immersed in distilled water for 24 hours and the weight (W )
0 w
is noted. Porosity is given by the following equation:
WWW −WWW
h = w 0 ×100 (10.3)
V
A rock with low porosity has high density and possesses high strength. For example, granite,
dolerite, charnockite, gneiss, and massive quartzite that have negligible porosity are dense
rocks possessing high strength.
10.3.5 Absorption
Absorption is the ratio of the weight of water fi lling the pores in a rock specimen to the weight
of the dry specimen expressed as percentage weight. To measure the absorption of a rock
specimen, it is oven-dried for 24 hours and its weight W is taken. The specimen is then kept
0
immersed in water for a period of 72 hours and the weight W is noted. The absorption of the
1
specimen is estimated by the following expression:
WWW WWW
1 0 ×100 (10.4)
WWW
0
A rock specimen kept immersed in water for suffi cient time may not absorb water to fi ll all
the pore spaces of the rock due to air in the pores. Some clay present in the pore spaces may
swell when the specimen is immersed in water and hinder entry of water into the pores. Thus,
absorption is not essentially dependant on the total volume of pore spaces in a rock specimen
but depends on its capacity to absorb water. Rocks with high absorption values are generally
low in strength (see the tables given in Section 10.4.6).

10.4 MEASUREMENT OF STRENGTH OF INTACT ROCK
Rock strength is the most important parameter in the design of a structure. The stability of a
structure depends upon the strength of the foundation rock and its behaviour under stress. The
strength of a rock can be assessed by subjecting it to any of the three stresses, namely compressive
stress, shear stress, and tensile stress and studying the resistivity of the rock as follows:
Compressive strength Compressive stresses comprising two opposite forces applied on a
rock specimen act to decrease the volume of the rock specimen. Compressive strength is the
maximum stress that is necessary to break a loaded specimen of rock. It is measured as the total
load applied per unit area in kg/cm2.
Shear strength Shearing action is caused by two forces acting in opposite directions along a
plane of weakness (e.g., fracture, fault, bedding plane) inclined at an angle to the forces. It tends
to move one part separated from the other part with respect to each other.
Tensile strength When a rock specimen is placed under tensile stress, its volume decreases
due to the forces directed outwards, opposite in action. The stresses tend to produce cracks in
the rock. Tensile strength is lower than compressive strength.
The laboratory measurement of the strength of a rock is taken in intact specimen in the form
of a cube, cylinder (generally in rock core), or disc. The laboratory equipped with rock cutting
and rock drilling machines facilitates preparation of the specimen for the test. A laboratory
type drilling machine can drill cylindrical specimens generally of diameters 25 mm, 38 mm,
and 63 mm. The rock cutting machine has an arrangement to cut the two opposite sides of the
cylindrical rock specimens perfectly parallel by means of its diamond saw. The instruments
used and the methods followed in the determination of strength properties of intact rocks in the
laboratory are described in the following subsections.
10.4.1 Rebound Hammer Test
Rebound hammer is a handy instrument consisting of a spring-loaded steel hammer (Fig. 10.2).
It is used to measure the approximate value of compressive strength of rock in hand specimen
and also to assess the uniformity characteristics of rock strength in outcrops. When the plunger
housing with the hammer is fi rmly compressed against a rock surface, the spring-loaded
hammer gets released automatically and rebounds after giving an impact of energy, the exact
amount can be read out from the scale given in
the graph card of the rebound hammer. Usually,
an energy impact of 0.075 m-kg is satisfactory.
Scale for measuring
rebound distance The rebound of the hammer is related to the
Plunger ultimate compressive strength and modulus of
elasticity of rock and is indicated in a scale as
rebound number. The rebound distance of the
hammer with respect to the plunger is measured
from the scale attached to the frame of the
hammer. The ultimate compressive strength

of the rock is thus obtained within 75 per cent

confi dence limit. For example, rebound numbers
49, 61, and 65 in the standard model of Schmidt
Fig. 10.2 Standard rebound hammer hammer are indicative of compressive strengths

Applications of Rock Mechanics in Engineering Geology ● 201
633 kg/cm2 857 kg/cm2, and 935 kg/cm2, respectively. The digital model of rebound hammer
automatically calculates the rebound numbers and the compressive strength.
10.4.2 Point Load Test
Point load testing machine, shown in Fig. 10.3(a), is a portable instrument used to measure
the strength of rock specimens in the laboratory as well as in the fi eld. The instrument consists
of a rigid frame, two point load platens that are conical in shape, a hydraulically activated
ram with pressure gauges, and a device to facilitate measurement of the distance between the
loading points. The pressure gauges of different ranges are given and the one to be fi tted with
the machine during testing should be of the type that can record the failure pressure. Several
sophisticated instruments with digital device for measuring pressure are also available. The
rock specimens tested by point load method fail under tension, developing cracks parallel to
the loading direction. The point load provides data as point index that can be converted into
compressive strength with reasonable accuracy by applying the empirical formula depending
upon the nature of the samples. The advantage of this instrument is that it can be used to test
irregular samples in the fi eld in addition to testing core and block specimens in the laboratory.
Ideally, the samples should be 50 mm in thickness.
In general, point load tests are conducted on the following four possible sample types shown
in Fig. 10.3(b):
• Type 1: Core samples for diametrical test
• Type 2: Core samples for axial test
• Type 3: Irregular lump sample
• Type 4: Block sample
Point load index (Is) can be calculated using the following relation:
P
Is= kg/cm2 (10.5)
D2
where P is the failure load and D is the distance between the two platens.

202 ● Engineering Geology
The point load test involves placing the rock sample tightly fi xed between the two conical
platens and compressing until failure occurs. In selecting samples for testing of blocks and
irregular samples, it is to be seen that the value of D remains at 50 mm or very close to it.
Otherwise, a correction is needed. The correction is done by using the size correction chart
given with the machine. For computation of uniaxial compressive strength parameters (Ic) from
the point load index (Is), the following relation is used:
Ic = (14 + 0.175D) × Is (10.6)
where D is the diameter or distance in millimetres. It has been proved that uniaxial compressive
strength calculated from point load index gives reasonably reliable values.
10.4.3 Test for Uniaxial Compressive Strength
Uniaxial unconfi ned compressive strength is the common test conducted in rock specimens
in the shape of a cylinder or cube. In general, NX-size (54 mm in diameter) cores obtained
from drilling are used for testing. The length of the core specimen is kept at 2 to 2.5 times the
diameter by cutting and grinding the two end faces parallel to each other. In its simple form,
the uniaxial compressive strength testing machine consists of a hydraulic jack for applying
pressure with increasing order. The machine is kept on a solid base and is fi tted with pressure
gauges to measure the applied pressure (Fig. 10.4). The specimen is placed between two platens

and pressure is applied slowly until the specimen crumbles. The crumbling may be in the form
of two intersecting cracks at acute angles or a set of parallel to semi-parallel cracks. The applied
pressure (P in kg) is noted from the pressure gauge and the compressive strength (s ) expressed
as applied pressure per unit area (A cm) is calculated as follows:
P

10.4.4 Tests for Triaxial Compressive Strength
There are several types of triaxial testing instruments. Figure 10.5 illustrates a simple type of
triaxial cell in which it is easy to conduct several tests without draining between tests (Hoek
2007). It consists of a steel cylinder with two platens for placing the rock specimen kept in a

rubber jacket, and the space of the cylinder surrounding the specimen is fi lled with oil that acts
as lateral pressure. The height of the cylindrical rock (generally NX size rock core) specimen
that is to be tested should be 2 to 2.5 times its diameter. Hoek’s cells of other sizes such as
AX and BX are also available. The oil that surrounds the rock specimen acts as the confi ning
pressure. Thus, in triaxial test, unlike uniaxial test, the rock specimen is subjected to lateral
pressure in addition to vertical (axial) stress. The axial pressure
is exerted through the top platen. The axial and confi ning loads
can be increased simultaneously, and then keeping the confi ning
stress constant, the axial stress is increased until the failure of
PPlaten the specimen occurs.
For rock specimens having high moisture content (75 per cent
Core
or more), it is necessary to measure the pore pressure. The strain
speccimen
gauge fi tted with the load cell measures the ultimate strength (the
PPlaten ability of rock without yielding to break). This strength of the rock
depends upon various factors such as the nature of rock including
its composition, grain size, and angularity and is also related to the
increased loading and fl uid content in rock pores. Using the test
results on various axial loads and lateral pressures until failure,
Mohr’s diagram and failure envelop for the tested rock specimen
are plotted to obtain the values of cohesion c and internal friction
angle f as done in triaxial soil tests (see Section 6.12,Fig. 6.20).
Fig. 10.6 Instrument (HEICO) for 10.4.5 Brazilian Test for Tensile Strength
Brazilian test for tensile strength
Brazilian test for tensile strength is conducted by applying
showing core specimen of diameter D
and length L (L /D < 1) fi xed between diametrical compression to induce tensile stress in a thin disc of
two platens rock core (Fig. 10.6). The ratio between the length (L) and diameter
Chapter_10.indd 203 10/27/2012 2:00:49 PM
204 ● Engineering Geology
(D) of the rock core test specimen should be less than one
(thus L /D < 1). The applied load creates a uniform tensile
stress across the disc diameter accompanied by a vertical
compressive stress as in the Brazilian test (Fig. 10.7). Special
precautions must be taken at the contact between the rock and
the loading platens to avoid crushing. If the failure is a true
splitting failure, that is, a tension crack running between the
loading points, the tensile strength is calculated as follows:
(a) (b) sss = 2P (10.8)
Fig. 10.7 Brazilian test: (a) applied load 1 pDL
on specimen diameter; and (b) tension
where s is the Brazilian tensile strength (MPa), P is the load
cracks 1
at failure, and D is the diameter (mm).
Tensile strength of a rock is lower than its compressive strength. A rock under tension will fail
earlier to compression. Hence, in the construction of an engineering structure on rocks, it is important
to know the stress regime of the rock, especially whether tension will be the primary force.
10.4.6 Test Results on Engineering Properties of Various Types of Rocks
The common engineering properties such as density, absorption, and uniaxial compressive
strength of major rock types are presented in Tables 10.1–10.3. The results are based on
large numbers of specimens of each rock type that were collected in different times from
various project sites and tested in the geotechnical laboratories of Geological Survey of India
(Gangopadhyay 1990). It may be seen that, in general, igneous and metamorphic rocks are
denser and possess higher strengths compared to the sedimentary rocks, except the Vindhyan
sandstone and limestone (Table 10.2).

10.5 ELASTIC PROPERTIES OF ROCKS
In case of deformation under continuously increasing stress on a rock body, it may be found that
at a certain stage, the body returns to its original shape if the stress is removed. In this stage,
the body is said to have elasticity and the strain is proportional to stress. In addition, a strained
elastic material stores the energy used to deform it, and the energy is recoverable. The body is
said to have reached its elastic limit at the stage when the magnitude of strain begins to exceed
the magnitude of stress permanently. When the strain goes beyond the elastic limit of the rock,
plastic fl ow takes place. If the rock is constituted of brittle materials, the plastic fl ow will be
small in extent, but in case of the rock that is ductile in nature, the plastic fl ow will be large.
This elastic behaviour of a rock is related to stress (s ) and strain (e). Stress is measured by
the relation s = P/A, where P is the force exerted in intact rock in an area A. Strain is given by
the expression e = ΔL /L, where L is the length and (ΔL) is the change in length of rock specimen.
Chapter_10.indd 205 10/27/2012 2:00:50 PM
206 ● Engineering Geology
The ratio between stress and strain is known as the modulus of elasticity or Young’s modulus
(E) and is expressed as
s P A
= =E (10.9)
e ΔLLL L
If the lateral stress in a rock is given by B, the ratio between strain of a material in lateral
extension (lateral strain) to the strain under vertical extension (axial strain) designated as
Poisson’s ratio is given by the following relation:
Lateralstrain ΔBBB B
= = m(Poisson’s ratio) (10.10)
Axialstraim ΔLLL L
Poisson’s ratio ( m) in a rock varies between 0.1 and 0.5. During earthquake, the waves move
through the rock guided by the elastic properties of the rock. The velocity of wave propagation
depends on Poisson’s ratio, which is variable in different rocks. Thus, depending upon the
nature of rock, the wave velocity generated by earthquake will change. In the same rock too, the
property may vary depending upon the interlocking nature of the mineral grains. Rocks with rigid
interlocking grains will have high modulus of elasticity, but with a large content of moisture as
in the case of an immersed body of rock, the modulus of elasticity will be reduced. This aspect
of elastic behaviour is signifi cant in the design of engineering structure to be founded on rock.
Modulus of elasticity or Young’s modulus is a measure of the rock property that resists
deformation. When a cylindrical specimen of rock is subjected to stress parallel to its long axis, it
will lengthen and the diameter will be under tension. Poisson’s ratio, that is, the ratio of lateral strain
to axial stress is measured when a cylindrical rock specimen is subjected to compression parallel
to the axis of the rock specimen; the rock shortens along its axis while its diameter increases.
10.6 MEASUREMENT OF STRESS IN UNDERGROUND ROCKS
The stability of an underground opening depends on the rock mass strength and the stress that
existed in the rock before the excavation. Tectonic events during geological time are responsible
for inducing this in-situ stress in rock. The magnitude of this pre-existing stress varies widely
depending upon the nature of geological history of the rock formation in which the in-situ
stress exists. The measurement of this in-situ stress in underground rocks is necessary before
excavation is taken up for constructing an underground structure.
The test results are utilized in the design of the underground structures and fi nding
remedial measures against any deformation of strata that may be caused by the release of
stress under the new condition. In fact, excavation design of all large underground openings
such as tunnels, railways, powerhouses, and storages for oil or nuclear waste disposal requires
measurement of the in-situ stress in rock mass. The methods of measuring in-situ stresses
are varied but two signifi cant methods include the fl at jack test and the borehole deformation
over-coring method.
10.6.1 Flat Jack Test (Direct Stress Measurement)
Flat jack test is the most convenient method for measuring in-situ stress in rocks of underground
openings. The fl at jack is a thin envelop-like bladder made of stainless steel with inlet and outlet
portals that can be pressurized with hydraulic oil. It measures the pressure required to restore
the set of measuring pins fi xed in rock wall on either side of a slot. Flat jacks are manufactured
in different confi gurations such as square, rectangular, or with curved edges and their sizes also

Fig. 10.8 Flat jack with inlet and outlet portals:
(a) rectangular; and (b) curved edged
vary to a great extent, generally between 30 cm × 30 cm and 60 cm × 60 cm, but may even be
a square metre depending on the application and slot preparation.
Flat jacks may be of different shapes (Fig. 10.8) such as square or rectangular but a curved
fl at jack is generally used to fi t a slot cut by a circular saw. The test is based on the principles
of stress release phenomenon and elimination of local stresses followed by controlled stress
compensation. The test is conducted in three phases (Fig. 10.9) as follows:
(i) A small portion of the wall is selected for the test where the rock is not affected by any
joint or facture and is also free from any external effects such as cracks due to blasting.
(ii) Two sets of stainless steel pins (reference pins) are then fi xed in the wall rock keeping a
space between them for inserting the fl at jack. After setting the pins and measuring the
distance (say, s), a slot is cut by means of a diamond saw so that the pins on either side
tend to move their positions due to stress relief phenomenon. The process relieves the rock
surface of the stress that originally existed across it. This is measured between the slots by
means of the pins fi xed prior to cutting. If the distance between the pins is s , then s < s,
1 1
where s is the distance in the undamaged state.
(iii) The fl at jack is then inserted into the slot and infl ated by applying hydraulic pressure
(p) to restore the original position of reference pins when s = s and p (original) = p
f 1 f
(cancelling pressure). Assuming that the rock mass is elastic within the range of working
stress, the measured cancellation pressure (p) is very nearly equal to the virgin stress that
f
existed in the rock normal to the plane of slot before the cutting of the slot. The virgin
stress is thus estimated by means of the fl at jack test.

The complete set of equipment necessary to conduct this test is shown in Fig. 10.10. For
conducting the fl at jack test in underground openings, it is necessary that an exploration adit
or pilot tunnel is driven up to the exact position or place of the proposed structural cavern.
The test is then taken up in a limited area of the excavated rock wall. The virgin stress remains
unaffected even after excavation, but if the wall rock is extremely fractured, either by tectonic
deformation or by blasting effect, the test cannot be effectively done.

10.6.2 Borehole Deformation Over-coring
Method of In-situ Stress
Measurement
In-situ stress in rock proposed for construction of an
underground structure can be measured as follows:
A small borehole is drilled to the desired depth. Then,
the instrument containing strain gauges is inserted
through the borehole and the initial reading is taken.
Then, another large hole is drilled outside the small
borehole to relieve the stress around this drilled
part and the strain gauge reading is taken again.
Fig. 10.10 A set of fl at jack testing equipment
The difference in readings provides the measure of
including a fl at jack, a hydraulic pump (used for
the borehole deformation. The techniques used are
infl ating fl at jack) with pressure gauge, hose
pipe, and guide frame for positioning of reference explained with illustrations (Figs 10.11–10.13) in the
pins and slot (HEICO) following steps:
(i) To start with, a large diameter (NX size) diamond drill hole is drilled to the depth zone at
which stress measurement is desired. After recovery of the drill cores, the bottom of the hole is
fl attened by a special drill bit as shown in Figs 10.11(a) and (b). A smaller diameter (EX size)
borehole is then drilled further down from the end of the large diameter hole, see Fig. 10.11(c).

(ii) The measuring cell containing a number of strain gauges is then inserted with a special
installing tool having an oriented device and a cable to read out unit. Compressed air is
used to expand the cell in the hole and the strain gauges are cemented to the wall rock of
the small borehole as shown in Fig. 10.12(a). The measuring cell now is fi xed to the hole
and initial reading (0 reading) is taken, see Fig. 10.12(b).

thin-walled diamond bit, thus relieving the stress at the core. The corresponding strains are

recorded by the strain gauge rosettes, see Fig. 10.13(a). The core is then recovered with a
special core catcher, see Fig.10.13(b), and immediately after removal, the second reading
is taken. From the recorded strain, the stress is computed from laboratory determination
of the elastic moduli of rock cores (see Section 10.5).
(a) (b)
Fig. 10.13 Borehole over-coring method: Stress measurement
This method may not be suitable if the boreholes are very deep as it is diffi cult to handle
the instrument at great depths. In boreholes deeper than 50 m, the hydraulic pressure technique
is generally followed for estimating in-situ stress in rocks. The principle of this method is to
determine the magnitude of the in-situ stress by the fracture pressure and the sealing pressure.
The fracture pressure is needed to produce cracks in the borehole walls and the sealing
pressures are needed to maintain the cracks when the pump is stopped. In this method, at the
required depth, a section of the borehole is sealed by two rubber packers. Hydraulic pressure
is applied to the internal walls between the two packers. When the breakdown pressure is
reached, the rock surrounding the borehole fails in tension and develops cracks. This fracture is
extended away from the boreholes by continuous pumping. When the pumps are shut off with
the hydraulic circuit kept closed, a shutdown pressure is recorded. This pressure is necessary to
keep the cracks open. The breakdown and shutdown pressures are related to the virgin stress in
the site. A borehole camera can be used to measure the direction of the cracks. Thus, both the
magnitude and the direction of the principal stress can be estimated.
10.6.3 Borehole Extensometer Test for Measuring Rock Movement
The rocks in an excavated underground cavern tend to move towards the centre of the opening
caused by induced stress exceeding the uniaxial compressive strength of the surrounding
rocks. The rate of such movement of an underground structure can be measured by a simple
instrument named borehole extensometer (Fig. 10.14). The instrument consists of a single rod
or wire called single position extensometer that extends between the anchor and the reference
head. Extensometer with more than one or two rods (up to a maximum of eight) is known as the
multiple position (or multipoint) extensometer (Fig. 10.15).

Both wire type and rod type extensometers may work on mechanical or electrical devices.
In practice, the instrument is grouted into the borehole keeping the reference head on the rock
wall of the excavated opening. Periodic readings are taken by the sensor on all the points in the
reference head. The difference between the initial and the fi nal reading indictes the movement
of rock mass during the period. The location, orientation, and length of a borehole extensometer
depend on the geotechnical features of the project site and the construction method for
determining the depth, direction, and amount of anticipated rock movement.
10.7 ESTIMATION OF ROCK MASS PROPERTIES
In the laboratory, only a small portion of the volume of rock mass is considered for testing
the rock properties. Hence, it is not representative of the rock mass or in-situ rocks where
an engineering structure will be built. Excavation of an underground cavity also involves a
large volume of rock mass, and test data on intact rock specimens cannot provide necessary
information for design purposes. It is, therefore, necessary to fi nd some procedures to estimate
the rock mass properties for design of engineering structures, excavation, and other purposes.
Several rock mass classifi cations are now available, which have been developed by several
authors to solve the practical problems related to rock mass properties that satisfy the needs of
engineering design. The various geological properties have been considered in devising these
classifi cations.
10.7.1 Rock Mass Classifi cations
It is to be remembered that rock mass classifi cation is essential at the early stage of project
planning. As such, engineering geological works are aimed at collecting the fi eld data related
to rock properties by measurement on in-situ rocks. This data accompanied by the laboratory
test data is fed into the classifi cation system for obtaining the quantitative values for the design.
The engineering requirement and the engineering geological information pertain to evaluation
of the in-situ characteristics of rocks especially for rock deformation and support purposes and
other follow-up measures for the design. Information on water condition and in-situ stress are
also necessary.
In general, the main purpose of the classifi cations is the safe design of tunnel and underground
structures and support system, but they are also applicable for other underground excavations
including mining. Several classifi cations were devised by a number of authors that include Deere
et al. (1967), Proctor (1971), Barton, Lien, and Lunde (1974 and 1975) Barton et al. (1980),
and Bieniawski (1974, 1975, 1979, and 1989). Earlier to that, Terzaghi (1946) developed a rock
mass classifi cation for the purpose of design of tunnel support in which loads are estimated on
the basis of descriptive geology.
10.7.2 Rock Mass Classifi cation of Terzaghi
The rock mass classifi cation of Terzaghi (1946) is based on the rock condition in the tunnel. It
bears good engineering geological information pertaining to rock quality meant for engineering
design of tunnel support (Section 16.10, Table 16.2). Tunnel rocks have been grouped under
different categories from hard rock to swelling rock giving the weak features as follows:
Intact rock It contains neither joints nor hair cracks and it breaks across sound rock. Blasting
in rock may cause spalling of rock from roof. Hard intact rock may face popping conditions of
sudden violent outbursts.
Chapter_10.indd 210 10/27/2012 2:00:53 PM
Applications of Rock Mechanics in Engineering Geology ● 211
Stratifi ed rock It consists of individual stratum with little or no resistance to separation along
boundaries of strata. Transverse joints may or may not weaken the strata and spalling condition
may be common in this rock.
Moderately jointed rock It contains joints and hair cracks but blocks created by joints will
not require support. Both spalling and popping conditions may be encountered.
Blocky and seamy rock It consists of rock fragments nearly or entirely separated from each
other and as such vertical wall may need lateral support.
Crushed but chemically intact rock In this type of rock, the fragments are like sand grains.
When crushed rock occurs below water table, it will behave as water-bearing sand.
Squeezing rock It advances slowly into the tunnel without any perceptible change in volume.
Small micaceous materials or clay minerals of low swelling capacity remain in the rock.
Swelling rock It advances into the tunnel because of expansion caused by clay minerals such
as montmorillonite having high swelling capacity.
10.7.3 Rock Quality Designation Index
The rock quality designation (RQD) index developed by Deere (Deere et al. 1967; D.U. Deere
and D.W. Deere 1988) is extremely useful in engineering geological description with quantitative
estimate of rock cores obtained from subsurface drilling. In fact, most of the authors have used
RQD as one of the important geological parameters in their rock mass classifi cations.
RQD is a measure of lengths of core pieces separated due to joints with respect to total
length of rock cores. It is the percentage of core recovery obtained in core pieces of 10 cm or
more in length out of the total length of the drill hole run in rock. Thus,
(Total length of cores of 10 cm or more)
RQD(%)= ×100
Total lengttttttthhh of core run in cm
Consider that in a site, rock mass has been drilled
TTTotal length of rock core run
for a length of 300 cm in fi ve runs. Rock cores obtained
300 cm
from the fi ve runs are of lengths 28 cm, 43 cm, 34 cm,
0 cm, and 48 cm (Fig. 10.16). Thus, the total length of
cores obtained is 153 cm.
Therefore,

212 ● Engineering Geology
Since RQD represents rock mass quality, the pieces of rock cores measured for RQD must
be representative of the in-situ condition. The orientation of the drill hole with respect to rock
attitudes may cause some splitting of cores and affect the value of RQD. Faulty drilling operation
may also result in more fragmentation of rock cores. It is therefore necessary that utmost care
is taken to obtain core pieces that resulted from geological causes such as joints and not by
artifi cial reasons. The drill hole should be made to obtain NX size cores using double tube core
barrel and diamond bits ensuring that fracturing of cores does not take place by drilling process.
When drill hole core is not available, RQD can be computed from the measurement of
number of joints in one cubic metre of rock in tunnel or drift by applying the following relation:
RQD = 115 − 3.3J
V
where J is the sum of the number of joints per unit length for all joint sets. This is known as
V
volumetric joint count.
10.8 NGI ROCK MASS CLASSIFICATION TO ESTIMATE TUNNELLING QUALITY INDEX
The rock mass classifi cation (Table 10.5) developed by Barton, Lien, and Lunde (1974) of NGI
is a widely used classifi cation in engineering geological works for measuring the rock quality
of tunnel and other underground excavations in rocks. The NGI classifi cation estimates the
tunnelling quality index (Q) from various geological parameters of tunnel rocks that can be
used for the design of support systems.
10.8.1 Empirical Equation Used in NGI Classifi cation
The empirical equation adopted in NGI classifi cation to derive rock tunnelling quality index
Q the numerical value of which varies from 0.001 to 1000 in a logarithmic scale is as follows:
RQQD Jr Jw
Q= × × (10.11)
Jn Ja SRF
where RQD is the rock quality designation,
Jn is the joint set number,
Jr is the joint roughness number,
Ja is the joint alteration number,
Jw is the joint water reduction factor, and
SRF is the stress reduction factor.
The rock tunnelling quality Q is considered to be a function of the following three measures:
(i) Block shear RQD/Jn
(ii) Inter-block shear strength Jr/Ja
(iii) Active stress Jw/SRF
Explaining these three quotients, the authors (Barton, Lien, and Lunde 1974) offered the
following comments:
‘The fi rst quotient (RQD/Jn), representing the structure of the rock mass, is a crude measure
of the block or particle size, with the two extreme values (100/0.5 and 10/20) differing by a
factor of 400. If the quotient is interpreted in units of centimetres, the extreme ‘particle sizes’
of 200 to 0.5 cm are seen to be crude but fairly realistic approximations. Probably the largest
Chapter_10.indd 212 10/27/2012 2:00:54 PM
Applications of Rock Mechanics in Engineering Geology ● 213
blocks should be several times this size and the smallest fragments less than half the size. (Clay
particles are of course excluded.)
‘The second quotient (Jr/Ja) represents the roughness and frictional characteristics of the
joint walls or fi lling materials. This quotient is weighted in favour of rough, unaltered joints in
direct contact. It is to be expected that such surfaces will be close to peak strength, that they
will dilate strongly when sheared, and they will therefore be especially favourable to tunnel
stability. When rock joints have thin clay mineral coatings and fi llings, the strength is reduced
signifi cantly. Nevertheless, rock wall contact after small shear displacements have occurred
may be a very important factor for preserving the excavation from ultimate failure. Where
no rock wall contact exists, the conditions are extremely unfavourable to tunnel stability. The
‘friction angles’ (given in Table 10.5) are a little below the residual strength values for most
clays, and are possibly down-graded by the fact that these clay bands or fi llings may tend
to consolidate during shear, at least if normal consolidation or if softening and swelling has
occurred. The swelling pressure of montmorillonite may also be a factor here.
‘The third quotient (Jw/SRF) consists of two stress parameters. SRF is a measure of
(i) loosening load in the case of an excavation through shear zones and clay bearing rock,
(ii) rock stress in competent rock, and (iii) squeezing loads in plastic incompetent rocks. It can
be regarded as a total stress parameter. The parameter Jw is a measure of water pressure, which
has an adverse effect on the shear strength of joints due to a reduction in effective normal stress.
Water may, in addition, cause softening and possible outwash in the case of clay-fi lled joints.
It has proved impossible to combine these two parameters in terms of inter-block effective
stress, because paradoxically a high value of effective normal stress may sometimes signify less
stable conditions than a low value, despite the higher shear strength. The quotient (Jw/SRF) is
a complicated empirical factor describing the ‘active stress.’ (Hoek 2007)

When making estimates of the rock mass quality (Q), the following guidelines should be
followed in addition to the notes listed in Table 10.5:
• When borehole core is unavailable, RQD can be estimated from the number of joints per unit
volume, in which the number of joints per metre for each joint set is added. A simple rela-
tionship can be used to convert this number to RQD for the case of clay-free rock masses:
RQD = 115 − 3.3Jv (approx.), where Jv is the total number of joints per cubic metre (0 <
RQD < 100 for 35 > Jv > 4.5).
• The parameter Jn representing the number of joint sets will often be affected by foliation,
schistosity, and slaty cleavage or bedding. If strongly developed, these parallel ‘joints’ should
obviously be counted as a complete joint set. However, if there are few joints visible, or if
only occasional breaks in the core are due to these features, then it will be more appropriate
to count them as ‘random’ joints when evaluating Jn.
• The parameters Jr and Ja (representing shear strength) should be relevant to the weakest
signifi cant joint set or clay-fi lled discontinuity in the given zone. However, if the joint set or
discontinuity with the minimum value of Jr/Ja is favourably oriented for stability, then a sec-
ond less-favourably oriented joint set or discontinuity may sometimes be more signifi cant,
and its higher value of Jr/Ja should be used when evaluating Q. The value of Jr/Ja should in
fact relate to the surface most likely to allow initiation of failure.
• When a rock mass contains clay, the SRF factor appropriate to loosening loads should be
evaluated. In such cases, the strength of the intact rock is of little interest. However, when
Chapter_10.indd 216 10/27/2012 2:00:55 PM
Applications of Rock Mechanics in Engineering Geology ● 217
jointing is minimal and clay is completely absent, the strength of the intact rock may become
the weakest link, and the stability will then depend on the ratio of rock stress to rock strength.
A strongly anisotropic stress fi eld is unfavourable for stability and is roughly accounted for
as in Note 2 in the table for stress reduction factor evaluation.
• The compressive and tensile strengths of the intact rock should be evaluated in the saturated
condition if this is appropriate to the present and future in-situ conditions. A very conserva-
tive estimate of the strength should be made for those rocks that deteriorate when exposed to
moist or saturated conditions.
10.8.2 Practical Example of Using Tunnelling Quality Index Q
The evaluation of the value of Q with the ultimate aim of estimating the support requirement
consulting Table 10.5 may appear to be a complex job, but it is easy to use in practice. The
following is an example of its use in North Koel tunnel in Bihar in granite gneiss (Gangopadhyay
and Mishra 1991). The values of the various parameters are as follows:
Table 10.6 Estimating support requirement using tunnelling quality index Q
Rock quality Good to excellent RQD = 90
Joint sets Two sets Jn = 4–6 (average 5)
Joint roughness Rough, undulating Jr = 3
Joint alteration Tight and hard Ja = 0.75
Joint water Dry, minor fl ow Jw = 1.0
Stress reduction Competent, single shear SRF = 2.5
Thus, substituting the values of RQD, Jn, Jr, Jw, and SRF in Eq. (10.11), we have Q = (90/5) ×
(3/0.75) × (1.0/2.5) = 28.
10.9 GEOMECHANICS CLASSIFICATION BASED ON ROCK MASS RATING
The rock mass classifi cation called geomechanics classifi cation (Table 10.7) developed by
Bieniawski (1974) is based on rock mass ratings (RMR) fi xed for the different characteristics
of tunnel rocks. In addition, rating adjustment is needed with respect to orientation of tunnel
drive with attitudes of strike and dip of joints.
10.9.1 Parameters Used in Rock Mass Ratings with Tables
The six parameters used for the geomechanics classifi cation are as follows:
(i) Strength of rock
(ii) RQD
(iii) Spacing of joints/discontinuities
(iv) Conditions of joints
(v) Groundwater condition
(vi) Strike and dip orientations of joints
Both point load and uniaxial compressive strength of rocks in megapascal units (1 MPa =
10 kg/sq) obtained from laboratory tests are considered for the parameter ‘strength of rock’.
Other parameters are determined from the study of the drill cores and rocks in the drift. The
equivalent ratings for each of these six parameters can be estimated from Table 10.7. The
summation of the equivalent ratings for the six parameters gives the fi nal RMR. From the value
Chapter_10.indd 217 10/27/2012 2:00:55 PM
218 ● Engineering Geology
of RMR, the rock mass class with respect to its quality can be known (as in Table 10.7C). It may
be noted that Bieniawski from time to time (1974, 1975, and 1979) refi ned his original rock
mass classifi cation and the one reproduced here (Table 10.7) is from the publication in 1989.

Ratings for the parameters can be obtained from Table 10.7A. The rating adjustment value
Chapter_10.indd 219 10/27/2012 2:00:55 PM

for joint orientation is taken from Table 10.7B through Table 10.7E. The result of study for
equivalent rating for each parameter and the total RMR thus obtained is as follows:
Table 10.8 Application of rock mass rating in North Koel tunnel project
Parameters Value/description Rating
Strength (compressive) 60–90 MPa 7
RQD 90% 20
Spacing of joints 0.3–0.8m 20
Condition of joints Rough surface, separation < 1 mm, hard joint wall rock 20
Groundwater None 10
Rating adjustment Very favourable 0
Total RMR (after adjustment) = 77
The RMR value of 77 falls under category II in the geomechanics classifi cation of rock
mass quality, which is graded as ‘good rock’ (Table 10.7C). As stated before, the estimation of
Q values for the same tunnel rock following the NGI rock mass classifi cation comes as 28,
which also falls in the category ‘good rock’.
Comparing the two systems of rock mass classifi cations, Hoek and Brown—Emperical
Strength Criteria (1980) has concluded that the Q values of the NGI system bears the following
relation with the RMR system:
RMR = 9 log Q + 44 (10.12)
e
Substituting the value of Q (28) of tunnel rocks estimated for the rocks of North Koel project
in Eq. (10.12), we have
RMR = 9 log 28 + 44 = 9 × 3.332 + 44 = 74, which is very close to the measured RMR value
e
of 77, indicating that both the classifi cations are equally effective in estimating the rock mass
quality. In fact, the design of tunnel and the support system made on the basis of the values of
both Q and RMR are found to be very useful in safe tunnelling (Section 16.10).
10.10 GEOLOGICAL STRENGTH INDEX FOR BLOCKY AND HETEROGENEOUS ROCK MASS
[Note: The Hoek method of rock mass strength determination briefl y discussed in this section
(along with tables) will be especially required for professionals working in underground
projects comprising tectonically disturbed rock formation, such as the Himalayan terrain where
the rock formations are affected by several faults and thrust. The related publications of Hoek
(reference given in this section) may be studied thoroughly for the application of the method
in project works.]
In a tectonically disturbed terrain such as Himalayan areas, the rock mass may be very
blocky containing discrete blocks interlocked by matrix. The strength of such blocky rock mass
depends upon the nature of small blocks, interlocking grains, and also their angularity and
roughness. These blocks may also be altered to various extents and the interfaces between the
blocks may have slickenside or may be fi lled by clay.
In such highly disturbed rocks, the rock quality cannot be evaluated from the NGI and
geomechanics methods. The strength of such in-situ rock mass must be evaluated from
geological observations and from the test results on individual rock pieces or rock surfaces that

have been removed from rock mass. This problem has been extensively discussed by Hoek and
Brown—Empirical Strength Criteria (1980).
To estimate the strength characteristics of such highly disturbed rock mass, later Hoek and
Brown (1997) proposed the geological strength index (GSI), which was further refi ned by
Marinos and Hoek (2001) who published two charts for estimating the GSI— one for blocky
rock mass and the other for heterogeneous rock mass. These have been reproduced here in
Tables 10.9 and 10.10, respectively.

The character of rocks, whether blocky or very blocky, seamy, disintegrated, sheared, or of
heterogeneous nature is to be decided fi rst for the application of the GSI system. In addition, the
following properties of the rock pieces are required for use in the Hoek–Brown criterion with
the ultimate purpose of application in design of underground excavation and support system for
highly disturbed as well as heterogeneous types of rock mass.

Wherever possible, the values of these constants are to be determined by laboratory analysis of
the results of a set of carefully conducted triaxial tests on core samples.
In case the desired tests cannot be done, the assumed values as given by Hoek (2007) for
the section ‘Rock properties’ can be consulted. The latest version of Hoek–Brown criterion
has been published by Hoek, Carranza–Torres, and Corkum (2002). This article together with
the computer programme known as RockLab can be downloaded for free from the Internet at
www.rocscience.com for use in implementing the criteria.
The method of GSI system and the Hoek–Brown criterion have been successfully used
in many underground projects in the world, giving reasonable estimates of a wide variety of
tectonically disturbed rocks. In India, the Hoek’s method was successfully utilized in the design
and support selection for the underground powerhouse of Nathpa Jhakri hydroelectric projects
in the Himalayan terrain of Himachal Pradesh.

LEARNING OBJECT IVES
After studying this chapter, the reader will be familiar with the following:
• Different stages of investigation of • Rock drilling and subsoil exploration by
engineering project sites pitting, trenching, and drilling
• Study of landform and geology from • Logging of drill cores and their
aerial photography and remote sensing recording and schematic presentation
• Different methods of geophysical • Water pumping test for permeability of

11.1 INTRODUCTION
This chapter discusses the various aspects of engineering geological investigation
in project sites. The investigation, which is conducted in different stages, starts
with in-house study of the site by aerial photography and remote sensing methods
followed by fi eld visits to obtain details of the site condition and record the geological
features by plane table mapping. Subsurface condition of the site is then evaluated
from geophysical and drilling explorations. Geophysical survey in engineering
projects is mostly done by seismic and resistivity methods but wherever required
gravity, magnetic, and radioactive methods are also applied. Rock cores collected
from drilling are tested in the laboratory for their engineering properties. Pumping
test is undertaken to fi nd the permeability characteristics of jointed rocks. After
each stage of investigation, a report is submitted with all the fi eld information and
the site geological map for design and safe construction of the project.
11.2 DIFFERENT STAGES OF SITE INVESTIGATION
Site investigation of an engineering project is the primary concern of an engineering
geologist. The geological information provided to the construction engineers from
surface and subsurface investigations is the basic requirement for economic design
and safe construction of engineering structures. The investigation begins after
fi nding the suitability of the site selected by the engineers with due consideration
of geological aspects. The site investigation also includes subsurface exploration by
geophysical methods and by rock core drilling. In all major projects,
Chapter_11.indd 226 10/26/2012 7:52:14 PM
Site Investigation ● 227
engineering geological investigation is carried out in three stages of project development
coinciding with the three main phases of engineering works as follows:
(i) Initial/preliminary stage (planning phase)
(ii) Feasibility/pre-construction stage (design phase)
(iii) Construction stage (excavation and construction phase)
Post-construction stage investigation is also carried out in some projects.
11.2.1 Initial Stage (Planning Phase)
The initial stage investigation of an engineering project takes account of the regional and
local geology including the rock types and structural setting of the project area. This may be
done from available maps and publications and reports of earlier studies. It is also essential
to visit the site to get fi rst-hand knowledge of the broad geological features of the project
area. In the preliminary engineering geological investigations, it is very important that an
assessment is made of the potential geological hazards or the weakness of the site and their
remedial measures. Of course, these assessed geological defects have to be substantiated by
further detailed investigation including exploratory works at a later stage so that the engineers
may incorporate appropriate corrective measures in the design of the structure including a cost
estimate. The important work involved in this stage includes preparation of a geological map
with standard geologic and structural symbols.

a bed or any planar surface of rock are the most important geological features. Dip is the maximum
slope or inclination of a bed or rock facewith respect to horizontal plane. The strike direction is
at a right angle to dip direction. Dip is expressed by both amount and direction but strike by only
direction. Thus, if a bed dips, say, 40° towards south (S), the strike will be east–west (E–W). A

Dip and strike measurements are made with a
simple instrument called clinometer or Brunton
compass (Fig. 11.3), which measures the strike
and dip direction (i.e., the direction of maximum
inclination of a rock face). The fl at surface of the
instrument is placed on the sloping rock face when
an indicator measures the inclination swinging
between 0° (horizontal) and 90° (vertical). It is
to be remembered that any angle other than the
maximum slope angle is not the dip but is called
apparent dip. So, an apparent dip will be always
less than the true dip and its direction is other
than the true dip direction. It may be noted that

11.2.2 Feasibility Stage (Design Phase)
Feasibility stage includes a detailed investigation to select the best possible site for an engineering
project. For example, a number of dam sites or tunnel alignments may be initially marked on
the map. Out of these, the most favourable site is to be selected from engineering geological
consideration. Feasibility stage investigation involves ground survey for the preparation of a
detailed geological map of the selected site. At this stage, mapping is carried out to a scale
varying between 1:10,000 and 1: 500. The adverse aspects of the foundation or other geological
problems of the project site are thoroughly studied in this stage and plotted on a large-scale
map, say, 1:1,000. The following two types of maps are of use in this stage:
Special purpose engineering geological maps The various features plotted in the geological
map prepared in an engineering site during the design phase include rock exposures and extent

of overburden materials in covered zone, rock types and their attitudes such as strike and dip,
and major structural features such as thrust, fault and shear zones, folds, and joints. The symbols
used in the map are shown in Fig. 11.2.
Depending upon the land formation and the type of the project, additional features are
documented in the map. Aspecial-purpose engineering mapis prepared in accordance with the
need of the engineering construction. For example, in the feasibility stage investigation for a
building project in a landslide-prone area, the map should indicate the land slope characteristics
including gullies and bad land topography, if present, active and old slides, area of subsidence,
drainage pattern, springs, if any, local water table condition, and so on (Fig. 11.5).
In addition to ground survey by surface mapping, feasibility stage study is also implemented by
remote sensing and photography interpretationfollowing thetechniques described in Section11.3.
Exploratory works such as pitting, trenching, and drilling are taken up after the geological mapping
of the site. Exploratory drifts are also necessary in large projects to get the details of subsurface
rocks and facilitate in-situ measurement of stress condition. If needed, geophysical studies are
carried out to understand the subsurface condition of the rocks including geological structures.
Geophysical survey is conducted through seismic, gravity, magnetic, electric, electromagnetic,
and radiometric techniques. Seismic method is generally utilized in many projects to evaluate
subsurface structures such as fault and other weak zones and also the thickness of different
rock formations. The earthquake intensity of the area is also studied from available records
and accordingly reported to the project authority for their inclusion in the design. Selection of
quarry sites of required quality and quantity of construction materials for the project is a very
important aspect of feasibility stage investigation.
Subsurface maps In addition to surface mapping, subsurface mapping is also carried out
in the feasibility stage. There are several ways to express subsurface geology and structural
conditions. Geological sections prepared from the attitudes of rock types are given in a map to
show the subsurface condition. Drilling data presented as drill hole logs (see Section 11.7.7)
are another way of presenting subsurface information, which helps design of an engineering
strata. Data on measurement of lithological contacts of rock formations inside tunnels and
study of rock structure are presented in the form of a tunnel log, which portrays subsurface
features of a tunnel (see Section 16.6.3). In fact, preparation of a subsurface map depends on the
requirement of engineering design. All these details of geological information are necessary for
the preparation of project report by the engineers along with design of the structures and cost
estimate.
11.2.3 Construction Stage
In many large projects, an engineering geologist’s presence is routinely required. The geologist
guides the exploratory work required for the site before beginning construction and prepares
detailed geological maps of the sites on scales varying between 1: 500 and 1: 50 when the
foundation is exposed after excavation prior to starting the construction. At this stage, plane table
survey with an alidade (Fig. 11.6) facilitates the plotting of topographic as well as geological
features at the site itself. While surveying, the geologist should be especially vigilant to detect
the geological weaknesses of the sites, plot these weak features in the map, and later report to
the project engineer suggesting suitable remedial methods for the weaknesses. For example, the
foundation rock may be highly fractured requiring treatment. If grouting is suggested to
strengthen the foundation rock, a plan for grout holes is to be prepared on the geological map
showing the location of the grout holes including their orientation and slope.

232 ● Engineering Geology
The engineering geologist gives prior or
immediate advice on the spot about the remedial
treatment for the safety of the engineering
structure. For example, a dam may experience
seepage of water through the foundation under
full reservoir condition. In such a case, the
engineering geologist will study the foundation
geology to locate the exact zone or path of
such seepage and suggest corrective measures.
Similarly, tunnel excavation through rock may face
hazardous geology in certain sections. Geological
mapping (3D tunnel logging) inside the tunnel
(Section 16.6) is undertaken to detect adverse
geological features, if any, and remedial measures
for the weak zones of tunnel rocks are suggested.
In fact, many of the hazards faced during or
immediately after construction of an engineering
structure are geological in nature or created by
Fig. 11.6 Plane table mapping of a project site
natural calamities such as fl oods, landslides, or
earthquakes. Engineering geologists investigate such geological hazards of the construction site
and report to the engineers suggesting corrective measures.
11.2.4 Post-construction Stage
Engineering geological investigation in a project may not end with the completion of the project.
In some projects, post-construction investigation may also be needed to study the behaviour of
a completed structure or detect any defect that endangers the stability of the same. For example,
a dam may experience distress, a stretch of a tunnel may collapse, a pier of a bridge may
develop cracks, or a reservoir may start leaking immediately or some time after its construction.
Such post-construction problems involve immediate investigation by an engineering geologist
to fi nd a rational solution to the problems. In the post-construction stage, the causes of distress
of the engineering structures are thoroughly investigated and remedial measures for immediate
follow-up action are recommended to save the structure from failure or further deteriorating
effect.
11.3 AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHY INTERPRETATION AND SATELLITE REMOTE SENSING
In engineering geological studies, aerial photography and satellite remote sensing have manifold
uses such as selection of suitable sites for dams, reservoirs, bridges, tunnel alignments, railway
tracks, highway routes, and pipeline alignments. They aid in the preparation of maps for terrain
evaluation from various perspective angles. Information obtained from the study of aerial
photographs and satellite imagery is immensely helpful not only in the planning stage, but also
during the execution and operation of engineering projects.
Studies of aerial photographs and satellite imagery give valuable information regarding
geomorphology, geology, groundwater condition, and surface water distribution. They also
help in the evaluation of vegetation cover and ground stability and in the preparation of maps
delineating the slide-prone areas showing old slides and recent slope failures. The study also
Chapter_11.indd 232 10/26/2012 7:52:15 PM
Site Investigation ● 233
assists in locating construction material and estimating the quantity of gravel deposit or sand
in a valley by photogrammetric methods. Fluvial landforms such as fl ood plains, point bar,
channel bar line, and back swamp are other features that can be deciphered from the study. The
various aspects of aerial photographic study and its interpretations are described in the following
subsections.
11.3.1 Aerial Photography
Indian Air Force is the repository of aerial photographs of the country. Sophisticated cameras
fi tted in aircraft fl ying at lower heights take aerial photographs of the earth’s surface. The
photographs taken are usually vertical, but may also be oblique which are used for special
purposes. Vertical photographs are used for the best interpretation of geological details. The
photographs taken are mainly of the following types:
Panchromatic photography This provides black and white photographs and is maximum
used.
Infrared photography This is sensitive to colour and brings out distinctive signatures for
water bodies, marshy land, and vegetation.
Colour photography This is specially prepared for identifi cation of mineral zones with
coloured beds.
Spectra zonal photography This is sensitive
to selective rays of the spectrum and is used for
special purposes.
An aerial photograph (Fig. 11.7) generally
varies in scale from 1:5000 to 1:60,000. For
engineering geological purpose, large-scale aerial
photographs on scales of 1:5000, 1:15,000, or
1:25,000 are preferred. The photographs can be
procured only from Survey of India. An index map
(scale 1:250,000) showing latitudes and longitudes
helps in precise identifi cation of the required
photographs of a desired area. The plan also
contains details such as the scale of photographs,
Fig. 11.7 An aerial photograph of an urban locality aerial camera used and its focal length, the date of
with roads and buildings in Gujarat photography, and other related aspects.
11.3.2 Applications of Stereoscope
A pair of aerial photographs taken from two camera stations covering some common area
(overlap) constitutes a stereo-pair. Stereo-pair photographs with 55 per cent to 65 per cent
overlap are used for stereoscopic study. Overlapping photographs, when superimposed by a
stereoscope, provide 3D view of the ground surface. The two types of stereoscopes used for 3D
views are as follows:
Pocket stereoscope for fi eld use This consists of convex lenses having focal length of
100 mm and magnifi cation of 2.5 and facilitates viewing only a small portion at a time.
Chapter_11.indd 233 10/26/2012 7:52:16 PM
234 ● Engineering Geology
Mirror stereoscope for offi ce use This has two fi xed mirrors aligned at an angle of 45°,
each refl ecting the image to a pair of 45° prisms. The refl ected image can be seen through the
eyepiece of a binocular. The magnifi cation obtained in this type of stereoscope can be enhanced
to 4× and 8×.
Parallax bar is an important tool used in the study of aerial photos with stereoscopes.
Parallax is the apparent displacement of position of a body with respect to a reference point,
and parallax bar is the instrument that measures the difference in absolute stereoscopic
parallaxes of two points imaged on a pair of aerial photographs. It is made up of two glasses
connected by a microscopic screw. The glasses are engraved with measuring marks known
as ‘fl oating marks’. This is an important method of a preliminary photogrammetric survey of
ground details.
11.3.3 Photographic Elements—Tone, Shape, and Texture
Photogeological interpretation of physical features and geology of a terrain is based on the
study of tone, shape, texture, and pattern, which are the signifi cant photographic elements of
aerial photographs. Tone is a measure of the quantity of light refl ected by an object and recorded
on a black and white fi lm photograph. Tones may have a wide variation usually in shades of
white, grey, and black. Shape or forms are the certain distinctive landform features seen in
aerial photographs that help in their identifi cation. For example, the shape of a depression
resembling a kettle hole indicates a glacial landform. Structures such as folds, domes, and
volcanic cones and landform features such as sand dunes, eskers, and river terraces can be
recognized from their typical shapes or forms. Texture is an indication of the roughness of a
surface and represents a combination of several fundamental characteristics of the photographs
such as tone shape and pattern. Texture may be fi ne, medium, or coarse. Very close spacing of
a stream results in fi ne texture of drainage, whereas wide spacing of the stream causes a coarse
texture of drainage.
11.3.4 Ground Pattern
Geological structures, landform features, and vegetation characteristics of a terrain exhibit
distinct ground patterns that help in their identifi cation from a study of aerial photographs.
For example, structures such as joints, faults, beddings, and dykes are recognized from their
characteristic linear patterns. Glacial deposits such as moraines, fl uvioglacial deposits such
as eskers and kames, alluvial deposits such as a fan, windborne deposits in arid region such
as sand dunes, and lacustrine outwash deposits are recognized from their pattern in the 3D
view. Ground slope variations are the other features easily distinguishable from the study of
the pattern. Plains, plateaus, escarpments, river terraces, and so forth have signifi cant patterns
provided by the relief features.
The drainage pattern plays a signifi cant role in the recognition of geological structures such
as folds, faults, and joint system. The drainage of an area may be of different types such as
dendritic, radial, parallel, annular, rectangular, and trellis (see Fig. 7.18). For example, a radial
drainage signifi es the presence of a dome or basin. Joints and faults are responsible for the
formation of rectangular drainage pattern. Dendritic pattern is indicative of the homogeneity
of bedrock having no structural control. Parallel drainage signifi es uniform unconsolidated
material. Trellis pattern results from lack of preferred orientation of structures or homogeneity
of rock types. The drainage pattern is sometimes indicative of the erosion of the rocks. Rapids
Chapter_11.indd 234 10/26/2012 7:52:16 PM
Site Investigation ● 235
and waterfalls created by erosion help to identify rocks with alternating soft and hard bands and
provide an idea of erosional effect. The distribution of vegetation has a distinct relation with the
rocky character of the area including the nature of the soil. For example, a rugged topography is
indicative of a hard rock area, a gentle topography is formed by soft rock, and a cultivated area
in a fl at land suggests fl oodplain deposits.
11.3.5 Identifi cation of Common Rocks
Experience in inductive evaluation of the photographic elements such as tone, texture, and
ground pattern supplemented by the ability to recognize the condition of the terrain help in the
identifi cation of the main rock types and broad structural features. The guidelines proposed to
identify common rocks are as follows:
Acid igneous rocks such as granite are characterized by light tones and basic igneous rocks
such as dolerite by dark tones. Both these igneous rock types are recognized by granular texture,
massive and homogeneous character, resistance to erosion, widely radial drainage, and rounded
and hummocky forms. Extrusive rocks such as rhyolite are generally of light tone and andesite
is of grey tone. Volcanic rocks such as basalt can be identifi ed by the presence of volcanic
cones, fl ow structures, columnar joints, and poor vegetation cover. Basalts exhibit dark tone,
fi ne texture, drainage, and occasional fl ow structure.
Metamorphic rocks, especially the high-grade types, show banding, prominent jointing,
subdued topography, medium tone, and parallel-to-sub-parallel drainage. Gneiss is recognized
by high drainage density, light tone, prominent topography, and absence of bedding; it sometimes
appears in the form of sharp ridges with an angular or dendritic drainage. Quartzites are of light
grey tone, medium texture, widely spaced drainage, and sharply crested ridges. Phyllite, schist,
and slate are characterized by grey-to-dark tone, sometimes with mottled appearance, and
dendritic drainage pattern with smooth rounded landform. Slate is recognized by its rectangular
drainage pattern and usually dark tone.
Sedimentary rocks can be identifi ed from characteristic tone, texture, and topographic
expressions. Sandstone is of light grey tone, medium texture, pitted appearance, and indistinct
bedding. Limestone can be recognized from karst topography, fi ne texture, light tone, internal
drainage, and occasional presence of sinkholes. Shale, silt, and clay are identifi ed from grey
to dark tone, fi ne texture, and closely spaced dendritic drainage. These rocks have intense
erosional features including badland topography, gentle gradient of bed, and subdued landform.
Conglomerate exhibits light tone, medium-to-coarse texture, pitted appearance, and indistinct
bedding.
11.3.6 Identifi cation of Large Rock Bodies and Major Rock Structures
A large igneous body has diagnostic pattern of landform and drainage. An intrusive body of
dolerite dyke has a distinct relationship with country rock that is known from the study of form
or shape. A dyke forms a straight ridge but the rock it has intruded generally forms the lower
ground. Metamorphic rocks have a characteristic lithological make-up that is different from
stratifi ed rocks or intrusive igneous bodies. Sometimes, igneous and metamorphic rock bodies
on a regional scale can be separated from the sedimentary horizons by the zone of tectonic
disturbance.
The Precambrian gneissic complex, for example, is separated from the Gondwana
sedimentaries by a boundary fault that can be identifi ed from the tonal change and pattern. The
regional dip of sedimentary strata is known from the expression of outcrops covering a large
Chapter_11.indd 235 10/26/2012 7:52:16 PM
236 ● Engineering Geology
area. The individual bedding dip often coincides with the ground slope and the dip direction
with the slope direction of the ground. Flat lying or nearly horizontal beds (dip < 5°) are easily
recognizable from the ground pattern. With some experience, an engineering geologist will be
able to estimate the low dip (5°–10°), medium dip (20°–45°), and high dip (> 45°) from the
shape or disposition of the sloping beds.
Structural features such as a fold can be recognized from the varying dip directions of the
strata. Sometimes, the whole of a fold can be viewed in an aerial photo. A plunging fold is
recognized from the drainage pattern of the terrain. The major stream generally curves round
the nose of such a fold, the convex side of the curve being the direction of the plunge of
an anticline. A fault can be identifi ed from features such as abrupt tonal change, repetitive
beds, offsetting of lenses and beddings, low relief compared to the adjacent ground, straight
depression in the ground or a straight channel for a long distance, waterfalls across a stream,
abrupt change in drainage pattern or landform, and rectangular depression. A regional tectonic
lineament created by a fault or a thrust can also be recognized from the study of overlapping
photographs under a stereoscope.
11.3.7 Satellite Remote Sensing
The nodal agency in India with respect to imagery is the National Remote Sensing Agency,
Government of India, Hyderabad. Satellite remote sensing provides data on the broad geological
aspects and ideas about topography, landform, drainage pattern, and vegetation cover. The
different stages of investigation include the interpretation of a set of actual photographs or
satellite imagery to obtain regional level information, detailed photo-interpretation covering
engineering project sites, fi eld check, and preparation of maps based on study results. The
various remote sensing techniques and their applications are described as follows:
Techniques of producing imagery
Remote sensing is a method of acquiring information about the earth’s surface from a distance.
The scanning equipment from a space satellite produces the imagery. A satellite sensor records
signatures corresponding to a wide range of wavelengths of the sun’s rays (or rays from its own
source) refl ected from the earth. The data referring to different spectral bands (i.e., different
wavelengths) can be selected, enhanced, and recombined by computer processing.
At present, in-situ collection of spectral refl ectance data of different rock types and structures
for computer analysis is used for correlation of the spectral bands for lithological and structural
differentiations. The imagery and computer compatible tapes are the data products useful for
visual interpretation of geological features. Multi-spectral images and false colour images
produced by assigning an arbitrary colour to one or more spectral bands that are specially
sensitive to variations in nature are used in ecological, agricultural, and varied geological
purposes including environmental study.
Remote sensing, as applied to geological studies in recent time, is based on the precise
measurement of the electromagnetic radiation, or spectral signature, from objects on the surface
of the earth. The electromagnetic spectrum ranges between very low and very high frequencies,
corresponding to very large and extremely tiny wavelengths. Remote sensing instruments,
or sensors, mounted on board a platform (a spacecraft such as a space shuttle or a satellite)
measure the spectral signature of the objects on the earth, which are later suitably analysed.
However, the signatures corresponding to the zone of visible or infrared rays are most suited
for geological remote sensing.

Site Investigation ● 237
Applications of remote sensing
The imagery obtained by orbiting satellites (Fig. 11.8) provides a good amount of information
regarding topography, vegetation, hydrology, and atmosphere of the earth. A number of satellites
(Landsat, Geosat, etc.) have been used for collecting data on natural resources including
geology. Landsat facilitates digital analysis of remotely sensed data that are useful in studying
surface geological features. The geological application of remote sensing techniques has the
following advantages over ground reconnaissance. The information on topography and geology
can be obtained in a much shorter time compared to ground survey and the regional geological
structures are precisely evaluated.
The area covered by a single image is rather large and is of the order of 100 × 100 km2, but
an aerial photo taken from a height of a few kilometres covers only a few square kilometres.
The scale of the imagery is generally 1:1,000,000 to 1: 250,000. Remote sensing techniques
facilitate comparative assessment of a changing landform of surface features from survey by
fl ights over the same area conducted in different periods. This helps in identifying the effects of
natural calamities such as earthquakes and landslides even on remote localities including those
on engineering structures from the study of the changing images of an area before and after e
natural hazards. In Figs 11.8(a) and (b) a comparative study of the imagery on May 2005, and
that of October 2005, clearly depicts the co-seismic effect of landslide of the earthquake of
October 2005 in a remote area of Jammu and Kashmir.

The remote sensing technique of a specifi c type is used for some specifi c information.
The satellite imagery (in infrared band) provides excellent data on morphological characters,
drainage system, seepage, infi ltration, and water saturation including the extent of fl ooding
for the preliminary and planning stages of investigation of a project. However, these do not
reveal the large scale geological details of an engineering site covering a small area (e.g., a
dam site and power plant site). Such details are generally available from the studies of aerial
photographs under the stereoscope. Interpretation of satellite imagery and aerial photographs
provides a wide range of data useful in engineering geological investigation, and engineering
geologists should involve themselves in this interpretation, especially to reveal the following
aspects:
(i) Regional structures (fault, fold, etc.), tectonic lineaments, and intrusive bodies such as
dykes and the nature of their contact zones with country rock
Chapter_11.indd 237 10/26/2012 7:52:16 PM
238 ● Engineering Geology
(ii) Characteristics of soil and rock types including extent of soil cover, outcrop area, attitudes
of rocks such as strike and dip of strata, and intensity of fractures and weathering
(iii) Identifi cation of zones of slides and subsidence and slide-prone areas
(iv) Terrain evaluation for railway communication and road alignment
(v) Hydrological aspects such as location of a groundwater basin, the distribution of water
saturated areas, and status of infi ltration in and around reservoir areas
(vi) Steepness of river gradient, drainage pattern, and swampy areas
(vii) Location of caverns and overall karstic condition, if any, in limestone terrain
A trained eye is, however, necessary for an accurate interpretation. It may be mentioned that
remote sensing and photo-interpretation are not the substitute of fi eld investigation. They are
tools of quick evaluation of the surface geology and morphology. Ground check-up is absolutely
necessary to fi nd the accuracy of the interpreted data.
Applications of geographic information system
Geographic information system (GIS), also known as geospatial information system, uses
computers and software to explore the fundamental principles of geography. It is a computer-
based tool to enable users to compute, store, analyse, and arrange spatially referenced data.
GIS helps geologists to understand questions and interpret and visualize data in many ways that
reveal relationship, pattern, and trend in the form of maps, reports, and charts. GIS technology
is capable of integrating common database operators such as statistical analysis with the unique
visualization and geographical analysis benefi ts offered by maps.
GIS allows engineering geologists to use existing data in new ways; for example, plotting
data on a map helps ask questions such as where, why, and how, with location information in
mind. Geographical knowledge helps in making better decisions. GIS is used to put together
the vast amount of information available today and provide a meaning to the overall picture. It
can be used to prepare maps coded by values from the database to help illustrate patterns. For
example, using GIS, the directional signs on a highway are managed. Similarly, the maps on the
Internet are made possible with GIS.
GIS can be applied in many fi elds such as agriculture, business, environment, forestry,
military, risk management, hydrology, and geology. In geology, GIS can be used to study
geological features, analyse soils and strata, assess seismic information, or create 3D displays
of geographical features. Further discussion on this computer-based subject is beyond the scope
of this book. Interested readers may study the book by Bruce Davis (2001). This fully updated
edition offers comprehensive introduction to the application of GIS concepts. The unique layout
provides clear, highly intuitive graphics and corresponding concept descriptions. This reference
book is helpful for experienced professionals as well as new readers.
11.4 GEOPHYSICAL EXPLORATION
Geophysical exploration provides information on subsurface rock conditions. The method is used
in the investigations of dam sites, tunnel alignments, power plants, bridge sites, and reservoir
areas to determine the depth to bedrock, overburden thickness, fault zone, and subterranean
cavities. There is some controversy on the authenticity of the data obtained from geophysical
exploration. It is, therefore, necessary to substantiate the accuracy of the geophysical data by
some boreholes before the data is used for project planning or design. The geophysical methods
mainly used in engineering geology are of the following types: seismic, gravity, magnetic,
resistivity, and radiometric.

Site Investigation ● 239
11.4.1 Seismic Survey
The seismic method of survey has wide applications in an engineering project. The seismic
wave has characteristic velocities in unconsolidated deposit and in different rock strata that
can be utilized to measure the thicknesses of overburden and underlying rock formations (e.g.,
sedimentary, igneous, and metamorphic rocks). This also enables us to detect unconformity
between two rock formations and identify geological structures such as faults and folds and
intrusive bodies such as batholith and dyke. To start with, a traverse line with a hole for explosion
(shot hole) is selected at the site of investigation and geophones are installed along the line at
fi xed distances related to the shot hole. A small charge of gelatine is exploded from the shot
hole. The seismic wave thus generated travels through the media or formation in the subsurface
region and is refl ected or refracted at a velocity dependent on the nature of media (Fig. 11.9).
The denser the media, the faster is the speed of the transmitted wave. In seismic surveys, the
fast-moving longitudinal wave is considered rather than the slow-moving shear wave.

The initial shot time and the travel time of the impulse of return journey are recorded in the
photographic traces in geophones. The difference of initial and return times gives the travel
times for the different geophones. The distances of the geophones from the shot hole are known
from the fi eld measurement. The times recorded in various geophones are plotted in the vertical
line and the corresponding distances along the horizontal line. This gives a straight line for
time–distance relation. The average velocity of travel (V) through a rock type, which is mostly
used, is obtained by simply dividing the distance by time (Fig 11.9). From the time–distance
curve, the distance D which is the intersection point of top formation and underlying formation
can be scaled out (Fig. 11.10).

The seismic survey also helps to estimate in-situ Young’s modulus (E ) following the equation:
E = V 2gg{(1+ p)(1 − 2p)}/(1 − p) (11.2)
Velocity V for Eq. (11.2) is known from seismic survey travel time record. The density of
several rock specimens is determined in the laboratory and the average value (g ) is taken. The
Poisson’s ratio (p) of a rock type (core samples) is calculated by determining the compressional
and shear wave velocities (Vp and Vs, respectively) of the samples in the laboratory by means
of ultrasonic material tester, and then substituting the values in the following equation:
Vp/Vs = {(1 − g)/(1/2 − g)}1/2 (11.3)
From the data available from seismic survey in rock formations of various project sites of
India, Bose and Arora (1969) calculated the longitudinal web velocity and the Young’s modulus
of various rock types as shown in Table 11.2.

The seismic depth computation formula is derived with the basic assumption that the
interfaces between geological formations are either horizontal or uniformly low dipping
(<10°). However, this condition may not prevail in the mountainous terrain where seismic
survey result is liable to some error because of very large elevation differences from geophone
to geophone along the seismic profi le; also, the steep depth of the foundation is a source of

error in seismic depth computation. It was found that the values of rock cover and overburden
thickness determined by seismic survey in the Himalayan terrain of Jaldhaka project (Banerjee
and Rao 1971) vary to an extent of ‘nil to +20 per cent’ with respect to the values obtained by
geological observations and drilling data. Due to the ruggedness of a terrain, various corrections
need to be made to get an approximation to the true value.
In engineering geological investigations, seismic survey technique is also applied to identify
the weak rock zone and structural features from contrasting velocities in crushed rock due to
fault and the intact rocks around. This method is signifi cant in detecting the fault and thrusts
in the projects of the Himalayan terrain. Once the fault zone is explored and confi rmed by
drilling, it is necessary to fi nd if the fault is active. This is done by investigating the activity
along the fault by seismometers installed along the fault plane or close to it. The instrument
uses the pulses transmitted from the ground by means of arms pivoted against a stable base,
and the result is recorded in seismograms on a revolving drum. Changes in the magnitude,
spacing, and location of minute tremors compared to the stable background provide data on
the increasing shocks. A seismometer furnishes data on the activity along the fault for small
pulses. In the Thein project of the Himalayan terrain in Punjab, a fault traced close to the dam
site by geological and seismic survey was investigated later by installing seismometers to fi nd
whether it is active.
For shallow depth seismic survey, instead of using explosives, seismic waves are generated
by the thumping of a sledge hammer. The technique is the same as the deep subsurface seismic
exploration. In this method, the shot points and geophones are arranged in close intervals of a
few metres to pick up the return of the wave formed by the striking of the hammer at the shot
points. Hammer seismograph is the instrument used for such shallow depth seismic survey. This
instrument is very handy and provides subsurface information covering a depth of 20–30 m.
11.4.2 Gravity Survey
The aim of a gravity survey is to record the gravity anomaly of a place due to the varying
densities of underlying rocks. The instrument used in the measurement of gravity is known
as the gravimeter. The gravity of an area measured by the instrument is not only the earth’s
gravity, which depends on the latitude, longitude, topography, and elevation of a place, but also
the density of the subsurface rocks. The gravity survey of an area provides data from which
gravity anomalies associated with subsurface rocks can be evaluated after suitable correction
(Bouguer correction) of several variables. The underlying dense rock body shows high or
positive anomaly and a subsurface light body gives low or negative anomaly.
The ground surveys are done at closely spaced intervals to detect the anomalies at a shallow
depth of the site. The data obtained is subjected to air, terrain, and Bouguer corrections to
obtain the correct value of g of a place. The values of g for different places within a large area
are plotted and depicted by contours. The density values of the rocks of a place determined
from the laboratory study of rock core specimens help in the calculation of the fi eld value of
density anomalies (positive or negative anomalies) of a place. The gravity method can be used
for detecting deep-seated cavities. The gravity survey conducted at the Kopili hydroelectric
project site in Assam was able to identify caverns at varying depths of limestone formation.
11.4.3 Magnetic Survey
The fi eld operation of magnetic method of survey is aimed at determining the density of rocks
in the site of survey. The instrument used in magnetic survey is known as the magnetometer,
which, similar to an ordinary compass needle, defl ects when magnetic rocks are present in the
Chapter_11.indd 241 10/26/2012 7:52:17 PM
242 ● Engineering Geology
vicinity. In the place of the compass needle, modern magnetometers consist of a device that
can pick up the presence of even a very small trace of magnetic substance. An iron ore deposit
or other such metalliferous minerals are detected by the magnetometer. Magnetism is imparted
by magnetite (Fe O ), and other magnetic minerals developed in the rocks in the area of survey.
3 4
The magnetometer records the positive and negative anomalies of magnetism in rocks measured
+
in unit of ‘gammas’ that range up to 1000. The data on anomalies is plotted in maps that can
be used for making sections and preparing models. The magnetic survey method of subsurface
investigation has limited use in engineering geology. Igneous bodies such as domes and dykes
covered under overburden in a project site can be detected using this method.
11.4.4 Resistivity Survey
Resistivity survey is also known as the electric or electromagnetic method of survey. It involves
the determination of resistance of rock or overburden material to current fl ow. The method is
based on the principle that any change in specifi c resistance brings about a change in current
fl ow through the media and consequent change in the electric potentials. The porosity of a sand
and soil deposit and the presence of fracture space ( joint openings) are controlling factors in
the resistivity.
To proceed with the resistivity survey in the fi eld, two pairs of electrodes are set on the
ground in a line, the distance from one electrode to the other being the same (Fig. 11.11).
Current is passed into the ground through the two end electrodes and the reduction in voltage
is measured through the central pairs of electrodes. The electrodes are made of porous pots
fi lled with copper sulphate solutions with copper plates immersed in it and passing from the
lids of the pots. The sulphate solution seeping from the porous pots makes electrical contacts
with the earth. Lateral shifting or increasing the spacing of the central pair of electrodes enables
measurement of lateral and vertical variations of voltage by a potentiometer. The following
equation is used to measure resistivity ( r):
r = 2pa (n /t),
Here, a is the spacing between two electrodes; t is the induced current fl ow through the
two end electrodes measured by a milliammeter; and n is the voltage between the electrodes
measured by a potentiometer connected with the inner pair of electrodes. r is expressed in
ohm/m, a in m, and n/t in ohms.

Resistivity survey is mainly used in exploring mineral deposits. In engineering geology,
this method is applied in determining the depth of porous (water being good conductor of
electricity) unconsolidated material and that of rocks at an engineering structural site. It can be
seen that low resistivity is indicative of overburden material or soft rocks, whereas hard rocks
(igneous or metamorphic) show high resistance values. Thus, the depth of the interface between
overburden and hard rock can be known from the resistivity survey.
11.4.5 Radioactivity Logging
Radioactivity logging includes neutron logging and gamma ray logging. Neutron logging
is mostly used for determination of moisture content, porosity, and density of soils and
rocks. In addition, radioactive logging can also be utilized to differentiate subsurface formations
containing sand, coal, anhydrite, and limestone, which are low in radioactivity compared to
bentonite, volcanic ash, and shale, which have higher radioactive values. Nuclear logging
involves nuclear reactions between radium or polonium on one side and beryllium on the other
to free the fast-travelling neutrons from the nuclei of the beryllium atom.
In practice, a stainless steel tube carrying the radioactive material along with a suitable detector
(such as Geiger counter) is placed into the subsurface strata through a bore hole (Fig. 11.12).
The scattered radiation is picked up by the detector (Geiger–Muller tube), amplifi ed, and then
counted in a scale or rate meter. The neutron scatters in all directions in the earth’s mass by
colliding with the earth’s materials. Collision with hydrogen atom results in decrease in kinetic
energy. A change in the count of the slow-moving neutron refl ects primarily a change in the water
content. The moisture content (quantity per unit volume)
can be measured by means of a collision curve. In fact, the
Towards recorder
technique of moisture determination by nuclear method
uses the property of elastic back scattering of neutrons.
Bore hole These neutrons collide with the nuclei of the surrounding
medium and are slowed down to thermal energy level as the
kinetic energy is partially transferred to the target nucleus.

Nath and Dhawale (1971), who conducted nuclear logging in the Malabar tunnel project of
Maharashtra, have given the details of investigation by radioactivity logging method, by both
neutron logging and gamma ray logging, for determining subsoil density and moisture content.
In Malabar tunnel, nuclear logging was conducted by using a caesium-137 gamma source and
utilizing the phenomenon of elastic back scattering of gamma radiation to obtain the density
values of rocks in the borehole. A radium–beryllium neutron source was used for determining
porosity using the property of scattering of neutron. The results are given in Fig. 11.13.

11.5 SUBSOIL EXPLORATION AND SAMPLING OF SOILS
The object of subsoil exploration is to obtain detailed information on the nature of the subsurface
material for safe and economic design of engineering structures. Exploratory boreholes in thick
soil deposit yield data on the layers of changing soil types at depths, the presence of bedrock,
if any, within the drilled depth, and the groundwater level. Boreholes also facilitate sampling
of soil from subsurface regions for conducting tests on their engineering properties in the
laboratory.
11.5.1 Exploration in Sites of Engineering Structures
The depth of exploration of a site made up of unconsolidated materials depends on the type of
the construction and the load of the structure to be imposed on the soil. For example, an earth
dam site is explored by drill holes to fi nd the depth of the bedrock or an impermeable soil zone
suitable for laying the cut-off. It is a general practice to extend the exploratory hole down to the
soil deposit where the imposed load of the engineering structure will not create shear failure or
any adverse effect on the soil. When a soil deposit is loaded with a structure, a pressure bulb is
created in the subsoil region with a gradually diminishing effect from ground surface towards
increasing depths. The borehole should at least go down to a depth where the isobar is one-tenth
of the surface loading. This depth is generally assumed to be one-and-a-half to two times the
width of the loaded structure. The general guidelines for the subsoil exploration of different
structural sites are as follows:
(i) At an earth dam site, the exploration should be continued down to a depth equivalent to
half the base of the dam, or twice the height of the dam. If the bedrock is available prior
to reaching this depth, the exploratory borehole is to be continued for at least 3 m into the
bedrock. The boreholes are spaced at every 15 m intervals along the dam axis and also
along the upstream and downstream parts. Some widely scattered holes are also taken up
depending upon subsoil condition.
(ii) In the case of a retaining wall, spread footings, or pile foundations, the subsurface
exploration is to be extended to one-and-a-half times the base width of the structure.
(iii) In road cuts, the exploration should be 1 m to 2 m in subsoil from the base of the cuts. In
the case of a fi ll, the exploration should be down to a depth equivalent to the height of the
fi ll structure, or at least 2 m from the ground surface.
(iv) Borrow areas for earth are also explored to different depths by pits and boreholes to
ascertain the quality and estimate the quantity.
11.5.2 Sampling from Pit and Using Soil Sampler with Drill Rod
For collecting an undisturbed sample of soil from close to the ground surface, a pit is dug.
A hump is created inside the pit by scooping out soil from all around so that it can exactly fi t
the inside space of a cylindrical container. The container (top and bottom removed) is then
carefully placed over the soil hump and the bottom part is sliced out so as to get an undisturbed
sample in the form of a cylinder. The two ends are sealed with paraffi n so that the moisture
content of the soil remains intact. This type of sampling is possible only in cohesive soil.
Alternatively, a large-diameter sampling tube can be driven manually into the bottom of the pit
to obtain a tube sample of soil. The tube is capped and carried to the laboratory for testing of soil
properties.
Chapter_11.indd 245 10/26/2012 7:52:17 PM
246 ● Engineering Geology
Exploratory drilling is commonly taken
up on soil deposit for collecting soil samples
from different depths using a soil sampler fi tted
with the drilling tube (Fig. 11.14). This helps
in ascertaining the change in soil characters
by laboratory tests of samples collected from
different depths. There are two types of soil
samples—disturbed and undisturbed. In
disturbed soil samples, the original structures
of soil are fully or partially destroyed and
these samples are not suitable for determining
the strength properties of the soil. However,
soil properties such as water content, grain
size, consistency limits, and compaction can
be determined from disturbed samples if they
are representative in nature. The undisturbed
samples are, however, best suited for the
Fig. 11.14 Subsoil exploration by borehole with determination of all the geotechnical properties
sampler tube of soil, and they are specially required for
conducting tests on shear strength, permeability,
and consolidation properties. Several methods of sampling are followed for recovering
undisturbed samples to ensure accurate determination of soil properties by laboratory tests.
The samplers commonly used for sampling from boreholes are divided into thick-wall and
thin-wall types.
The open drive sampler may be of thick-wall or thin-wall type. It is a tube with its lower end
open and sharp that facilitates driving into the soil (Fig. 11.15). The tube may be seamless or
split into two parts. The upper part of the sampler is provided with a valve to allow escape of
water or air when driving into the soil. During the lifting of the sampler, the check valve helps to
retain the sample inside the tube. The split-type tube (also called split spoon sampler) is provided
with a thin-walled liner inside the tube.
The stationary piston sampler consists of a
piston attached to a long piston rod for sampling

from drill holes. The lower end of the sampler
remains closed with the piston during downward
movement preventing any entry of water or soil.

11.6 METHODS OF SUBSOIL EXPLORATION
Soil exploration is aimed towards identifying the subsurface soil condition of engineering
sites. The common methods used in the exploration of subsoil include pitting and trenching,
sounding, standard penetration test, and exploratory drill holes.
11.6.1 Pitting and Trenching
Test pits or trenches are commonly excavated covering the entire area of small structures so
that any major change in the soil type within a depth of 3 m to 6 m can be revealed. One pit
is commonly dug at each end of the structure. For roads, canals, and similar constructions
covering a long distance, one pit or trench is excavated at every 100 m to 500 m intervals
covering the entire length along the central line of the cut or fi ll to fi nd the variation in the
nature of soil in its spatial distribution. Penetration resistance test conducted in each pit provides
data within a short time on the variations in soil characteristics. Exploration by the method of
pitting and trenching serves dual purpose: one, it provides identifi cation with respect to the
variations in soil characteristics in spatial and depthwise distribution, and two, it facilitates
detailed sampling representative of different soil types covering the entire area of exploration.
The samples are tested in the laboratory for their engineering properties as required for design
purposes. Wherever required, in-situ testing of soil is also carried out inside the test pits.
11.6.2 Penetration Resistance
Subsoil exploration by penetration resistance (same as subsurface investigation by ‘sounding’)
is a simple technique of driving a rod or a rod with a cone into the soil and measuring the
resistance offered by the soil. The penetration resistance of soil is determined by standard
penetration test and cone penetration test. In standard penetration test (Indian Standards 2131–
1963), a 3.5 cm-diameter (sampling) tube with a driving tip is used as the ‘driving rod’. The
tube is encased inside a 5 cm-diameter tube. The driving rod with encasing is forced into soil by
blows imparted by a 65 kg drive weight from a 75 cm fall. The rod is allowed to penetrate up to
a depth of 45 cm or it is deepened until 100 blows are applied. The 45 cm steady drive into the
soil is recorded as penetration resistance ‘N’. If the sampler is unable to penetrate even a depth
of 2.5 cm with 50 blows, it is considered a ‘refusal’ of penetration. The equivalent penetration
resistance ‘Ne’ is calculated from the following relation proposed by Terzaghi and Peck (1967):
Ne = 15 + 1/2 (N − 15)
where N is the penetration recorded from observation.
There are standard charts for empirical correlation of the penetration resistance for both
cohesionless and cohesive soils that provide data on saturated density and bearing strength
(unconfi ned compressive strength). The Dutch cone penetration test is very useful to determine
the bearing capacity of the cohesionless soil. The test is done by an instrument having a steel
rod (annular pipe/tube) with a 60° steel cone (base area 10 cm2 ) at the driving end of the rod.
The rod is enclosed in a tube with its outer diameter equal to the base of the cone. The upper
end of the rod is fi tted with a pressure gauge by a proving ring that measures the resistance. The
extent of the steady penetration of the cone under standard blows decides the type of soil with
respect to its density and bearing strength. The rod with cone can be forced into the soil with
or without the enclosed tube. When it is pushed without the encased tube, it is to overcome the
point resistance due to the penetration of cone. The rod with cone alone is pushed down inside
the soil by a jack and the value of resistance for 8 cm penetration is recorded, which gives the
Chapter_11.indd 247 10/26/2012 7:52:18 PM
248 ● Engineering Geology
cone resistance. Then, the rod with cone and the enclosed tube are forced to penetrate further
20 cm to give the value of cone resistance and the frictional resistance along the tube.
11.6.3 Subsoil Exploration by Drill Holes
Drilling for subsoil exploration includes the following:
(i) Auger drilling
(ii) Wash boring
(iii) Percussion drilling (free falling)
(iv) Percussion rotary drilling
Auger drilling
Auger drilling is the simplest method of subsurface exploration and sampling of soil commonly
from shallow depths. Auger drills may be hand operated or power driven. A hand-operated auger
is in general operated by two persons by moving or turning a handle as shown in Fig. 11.16(a).
The auger is pressed into the soil and at the same time a turning motion is applied to the blades to
allow entry of soil inside the auger tip. The size of the hand-operated augers varies from 5 cm to 20
cm in diameter and can drill generally up to a depth of 6 m in cohesive
soil above the water table. A tripod stand and a simple hoist are used
for the operation of the auger drill for deeper holes. Drill holes of
more than 6 m depth can be made by screwing together several of the
1.5-m long extension rods during the progress of drilling. The auger
can be used to collect disturbed samples from shallow depth. The
sampling ends of the auger that collect subsurface soil by rotational
movements may be of various shapes—the most common types being
Iwan type, helical (spiral) surface type, and the closed spiral type as
shown in Fig. 11.16 (b).
A power auger, which may be truck mounted, is very useful in
boring a large area in a short time. Power augers have continuous
(a) (b) (c)
fl ights provided with hard and sharp cutting bits. Continuous fl ight
Fig. 11.16 Hand-operated
auger drilling can make holes up to 35 cm in diameter and penetrate
augers for use in soft soil:
up to 50 m or more. In addition to soil, power augers are used for
(a) with a handle and Iwan-type
boring and sampling in sand, gravel, and clay deposits. These can also
sampling tip; (b) with helical
spiral tip; and (c) with closed be used in soft rocks such as shale and chalk. In general, no casing
spiral tip is provided in the auger holes except where the drill holes are driven
below the water table and through a sandy soil zone. The samples of
soil collected from both hand- and machine-operated auger holes are disturbed but they can be
used for identifi cation of soil types and their variations at depths. Auger drilling is very helpful
in exploring borrow areas for soil of earthen dam and highways but is ineffective in boulder soil.
Wash boring
Wash boring is an inexpensive technique used for getting a general idea of subsurface condition
of the soil. The wash boring equipment consists of a drill rod (2 cm diameter) inside a casing
(5 cm diameter), which can be raised and dropped alternately into the soil (Fig. 11.17). The
lower end of the drilling rod is provided with a sharp chisel or chopping bid to penetrate the soil
or cut soft rocks into small pieces. Water is allowed to enter under pressure through the drill rod,
which affects recovery of cuttings in the form of soil–water slurry to ground surface through the
space between the rod and the casing.

The slurry or cuttings preserved as ‘wash samples’ is not suitable for conducting tests for
soil properties, but they give a fair idea about the nature of soil and the type of bedrock. As the
wash boring progresses, soil formation of different hardness may be encountered showing the
changing soil types at different depths. The presence (and, hence, the depth) of bedrock below the
soil deposit can also be deciphered from the feeling of resistance to drilling and identifi cation of
cuttings obtained during boring. The groundwater level at the site of exploration is estimated from
periodic measurements in wash borings. Undisturbed soil samples can be recovered by inserting
appropriate sampling tools after cleaning the bottom of the pipe.
Percussion drilling
The free falling type percussion drilling consists of a chisel bit suspended by a cable or attached
to a drill rod for boring in soil or soft rock formations by repeated blows against the bottom of the
hole. The materials give an approximate idea about the formations at depth, but are not suitable
for conducting laboratory tests for their properties. In general, percussion drilling is undertaken in
overburden material consisting of sand and clay in varied proportions. To start with, the bit used is
30 cm in diameter which decreases to 7.6 cm at the downward end. If the bedrock is encountered
below a soil deposit, the motion imparted by falling type of percussion drilling crushes the rock
rather than chipping it. The hole gets saturated with water during drilling below water table. A
bailer is used to remove the water–soil slurry or pulverized rocks from time to time from inside
the hole. The slurry is also bailed out to keep the hole clean before sampling of soil from the
bottom of the hole. Separate cables are used for operating the bailer and the bit. A beam moving
up and down by a motor acts as a hammer to drive a sampler for collecting soil from depth.
In percussion rotary drilling, both percussion and rotary movements act together. This method
is rapid in non-coring holes. Percussion rotary drilling is more advanced and gives more progress
than the falling type, and as such, this rotary type is mostly used in exploring project sites. The
crushed rocks produced by the drilling are taken out by fl ashing of water or passing air or both
together through the drill hole. This type of drilling may be effected by jack hammer or wagon-
type drill holes. The percussion rotary drill uses a single-piece drill rod with a tungsten carbide
(TC) bit that can penetrate up to 6 m depth. The chisel-shaped bit or four-parts bit is also used
for uniform penetration. Extension rods can be added for deeper boring. For rock drilling by
percussion rotary type, equipment with extra strong rotation machinery is available, which can
drill 4 cm-diameter holes down to a depth of nearly 20 m. This type of drilling equipment is useful
for non-coring shallow holes for grouting purpose in tunnels and dam foundations.

11.7 EXPLORATORY DRILLING IN ROCKS
Exploratory drilling in rocks has wide application in engineering projects. Almost all
structural sites such as dams, tunnels, bridges, and powerhouses are explored by drilling for
rock cores. The machine used in core drilling is
known as the drill rig. There are several types of
rigs operated by motors. Diesel or compressed
air is generally used in running the motors, as
electricity is seldom available in project sites
located in the hilly or remote areas. Figure 11.18
shows a rock drilling operation in a remote area
by drilling rig operated by a diesel-run motor,
with a badland topography at the back. Where
good roads are available, truck- or jeep-loaded
drill rig can be conveniently used, saving the
operation time.
11.7.1 Importance of Rock Drilling in
Engineering Geology Works
Subsurface exploration by drilling is a standard
practice in engineering geological investigation.
Primarily, diamond core drilling is taken up for
identifying the nature of rocks at depths and
Fig. 11.18 Rock drilling by drill rig
laboratory testing of the core specimens. Though
core drilling is an expensive process, the cost is
small when compared to the total cost of the project. The utilities of such drilling in rock related
to engineering geological investigation are mainly as follows:
(i) In the construction of concrete and masonry dams, the drill holes provide information on
the rock type, the depth of bedrock, and foundation grade rock.

11.7.2 Rotary or Core Drilling
In rotary drilling, single or double tube core barrels provided with commercial diamond-studded
bits, TC bits, or steel bits with shots are used for obtaining cores of rock or hard soil. Diamond
rotary drilling machines for recovery of rock cores are widely deployed in subsurface explorations
related to engineering geological investigations. In diamond core drilling, the bits used are the
cast set commercial diamonds that are permanently fi xed to the cutting end of the rotary tubes.
Since diamond is the hardest of all minerals, the diamond drill machine can penetrate all types
of rocks. The machine can also drill holes at any angle and at rates of more than 3 m per hour.
According to Chugh (1971), ‘the essence of diamond drilling continues to be man’s ability to
interpret from the behaviour of drilling machine as to what is happening in the hole.’
The diamond core drilling (rotary drilling) uses 3 m-long steel tubes (also called rods or
pipes) screwed together as the drilling progresses in cutting rocks in a downward direction. The
motor operates a drill head. The tubes are suspended from the tripod. As the tubes are rotated
by means of a gear, the bit cuts the rock into circular cores by the pressure of a hydraulic jack.
Water is circulated into shallow holes by means of a pump for the purpose of lubricating the
passage. Bentonite clay (sometimes added with barites) mixed with water (called drilling mud)
is pumped into deeper holes to create a bond with the wall rocks for preventing them from
caving in. The double-tube core barrel is used for maximum core recovery and less mechanical
breakage of cores. The diamond drill machines are of different capacities. A machine weighing
75 kg may drill up to 100 m. Light weight mobile drilling machines shown in Fig. 11.19(a) are
also available, which save time in shifting and setting up the machine. Jeep-mounted machines
are useful for drilling in rough terrain. The cutting bits, shown in Fig. 11.19(b), are fi xed to the
outer tube that rotates to cut the rock, while the cores are retained in the inner tube that does
not rotate. A sample catching device, see Fig. 11.19(c), at the lowermost drill rod (inner tube)
collects the rock core samples and carries them to the surface when the rods are lifted up.

11.7.3 Depth and Spacing of Drill Holes
The geological programme of drilling with respect to location, depth, and spacing of the holes
is based on the nature of the engineering structure and geological condition of the site revealed
Chapter_11.indd 251 10/26/2012 7:52:19 PM
252 ● Engineering Geology
from surface mapping. In case of a large dam consisting of a uniform rock type, the holes are
commonly drilled at least 6 m into the fresh rock and spaced at 15 m intervals along the dam
axis and also upstream and downstream parts. Along a tunnel alignment, the drill holes should
be spaced initially at 30 m intervals and extending 6 m below the tunnel fl oor. However, if the
bedrock is available at a shallow depth, the hole may be stopped after penetrating 10 m in sound
rock. If the dam axis and the tunnel alignment are very long, the spacing may be at 30 m and 60 m
intervals, respectively. Depending upon the rock conditions observed in these holes, intermediate
holes are planned at places where there are suspected variations in rock textures and structures.
In the case of sites for small structures such as small dams and powerhouses, the holes are to
be made at closer intervals, say 6 m to 10 m, and extended at least 6 m into the bedrock. If the site
comprises heterogeneous rock types, the location plan of the drill holes should be such that these
provide data on rock conditions of each rock type at depth. If weak features are identifi ed from
surface investigation of a site, the weak zones are to be probed for their subsurface extension by
special holes including inclined holes. Normally, holes are drilled vertically but inclined holes are
sometimes planned directing nearly at right angle to dip direction. All holes should be made by
diamond drilling, preferably by double-tube core barrel ensuring maximum core recovery.
11.7.4 Selection of Core Bits for Rock Cores
A proper geological study requires continuous cores and maximum core recovery. To achieve
this, it is necessary to select the right type of core bits with respect to their size and quality. For
example, an NX-size core bit with diamond impregnation provides the best core recovery. In
addition, double-tube core barrels are to be used. A casing is fi rst driven using casing core bit.
The outer tube or barrel protects the borehole side walls from collapsing and the central tube
brings the rock core. The size of the casing or core bits that make the casing hole and core hole is
approximately 1.59 to 0.79 mm more than the diameters of the casing and core holes (Table 11.4).
Table 11.4 Size of boreholes and rock cores

NX 89 76 60 54
BX 73 60 48 41
AX 57 48 41 30
EX 46 38 33 22
The bits vary widely in their shape and constituent material. They are made of steel, TC,
or industrial diamond called bort. Steel and TC bits are used in soft rock such as sedimentary
strata, but in hard rock, diamond-impregnated bits are always used to obtain maximum core
recovery. Diamond, other than the bort variety, is also used to make bits, but these are very
expensive and are used in exceptionally hard rocks. In geological works, drill holes should be
made for obtaining NX-size cores. If the hole is very deep, it is customary to change the hole
from NX to BX size from a depth, say, 15 m, and reduce it to AX size at a further depth. This
is done to reduce the pressure imposed by the tubes. For geological purposes the EX-size drill
holes are seldom planned for recovering rock cores, except where the drilling is limited to about
6 m in rock. Holes of 75 cm diameter and larger dimensions are excavated by calyx drill, which
is a non-coring type of shot drilling. These large diameter holes facilitate visual observation of
the side walls of the holes.
Chapter_11.indd 252 10/26/2012 7:52:20 PM
Site Investigation ● 253
Vertical holes are generally preferred for easy operations and accurate measurements of
the thickness and other parameters of rock formations at depths. Inclined holes can, however,
be drilled at any angle and even horizontal holes are drilled to meet specifi c geological
requirements. For example, a vertical hole from the top of a hill is not desirable if the depth
of the proposed tunnel is prohibitive, but a horizontal hole driven from the slope can penetrate
the desired tunnel level. Inclined holes are taken up to prove a suspected fault or other weak
zones. The river bedrocks are also to be explored by angle holes from the banks. In the case of
an inclined hole, corrections are to be applied to obtain the exact thickness and attitude of a bed.
11.7.5 Selection of Bits for Drilling in Boulder Deposit
A big boulder trapped in an overburden or a cluster of boulders with cemented matrix may
provide cores that may appear like bedrock. The cores are to be carefully studied for smooth
and round surface. Knowledge of local geology and the materials below will also help to
differentiate the actual bedrock from the overburden (boulder deposit). A loosely compacted
boulder bed may cause problems during drilling. It is a common observation in many boreholes
that the bit does not cut the rock, but instead the rod rotates only to make the rock surface
smooth. The loose boulders keep shifting during drilling and the bits cannot get any grip on
them for cutting. This is a condition when a boulder is struck at the lowermost level. This leads
to the inference of the presence of a loosely compact bed of boulders at depth. An experienced
driller can understand the presence of a boulder or pebble in such a situation.
Rotation of bits instead of cutting also causes considerable wear and tear of the bits including
the core barrel and rods. Under this condition, lowering of the pipes is also diffi cult. To overcome
this situation, either the hole is fi rst drilled by a smaller size coring bit and later reamed out
with casing shoe bit or if the expected depth of the boulder formation is within 30 m, driving
pipes of 10 cm, 7.5 cm, or 5 cm diameters should be used. In deeper parts, it is recommended
to start with 15 cm drive pipes if the boulder bed is at a deeper part. Coring is then done with
smaller size bits. When core recovery of the overburden material is not required, it is preferable
to take up percussion drilling in this part to save the cost. Core drilling may be resorted to once
the bedrock is struck. An experienced driller can sense the striking of the bedrock below the
overburden by the change in the cutting pressure (Chugh, 1985).
11.7.6 Ways to Improve Core Recovery
The geological interpretation and engineering design to a great extent depend on the percentage
of core recovery. Very low core recovery in foundation drilling for rock is interpreted to be due
to the soft nature of rock or presence of weak zones when the design of the structure is provided
with additional measures, which are not normally required. During drilling in soft rock, there is
considerable core loss due to washing of the soft particles by the circulating water used for drilling.
This is a normal condition. On the contrary, drilling at a fast rate is also responsible for low recovery
of cores caused by grinding. This is an artifi cial situation. However, normal core recovery is vital
for the correct evaluation of rock quality, alteration, joint frequency, and other vital parameters
required for judging the stress condition and support requirement for tunnel and underground
chambers such as powerhouses. The engineering geologist should assess the drilling and ask the
driller to use optimum speed, say, 250 rpm or so, for best possible recovery. To achieve this, drilling
must be done with NX-size diamond coring bits and adhere to the following guidelines:
(i) Double-tube core barrel should be used, especially during drilling in soft rock and
overburden materials.
Chapter_11.indd 253 10/26/2012 7:52:20 PM
254 ● Engineering Geology
(ii) Very hard and massive rock is likely to give 100 per cent core recovery even with single-
tube core barrel, but if the rock has separating planes such as joints, double tube core
barrel should always be used.
(iii) Best result is obtained by using 0.6 to 1 m-long rods instead of 3 m-long rods.
(iv) Once the inner gauge stones wear out, the bits should be withdrawn (for resetting) and
new ones used.
(v) In soft and caving rocks, bentonite slurry should be used to stabilize the rock wall.
(vi) Bits set with small-size diamonds (30–100 numbers per carat) are to be used. The choice
for the diamond size and matrix should be as per Table 11.5 (Mustafy 1966).

11.7.7 Logging of Drill Cores and Diagrammatic Representation
Once the drilling of a hole is completed, the main task of the geologist is the logging of the
cores obtained from the hole. The cores are kept in specially-prepared boxes in a systematic
way. On the cover of each box, the assigned number of the borehole and its location and
ground elevation are to be distinctly indicated.
The cores recovered from each ‘run’ of the
drilling (generally of 3 m length) are kept in the
core box and the depths are written on a wooden
piece by non-washable ink (Fig. 11.20). This
arrangement of cores is done until all the cores
are kept in the box, systematically recording
the depths. In general, the driller or engineer in
charge of the drilling site keeps the core in the
core boxes, recording the relevant information.
In case the rock cores are available below the
overburden cover (non-coring), some ‘wash’ of
the overburden is kept in the box and the depth
at which the overburden ends is noted. This
helps to determine the thickness of overburden
and the depth to bedrock while studying the
core in the core box.
The geological logging of rock cores includes

percentage core recovery for every run of drilling, measurement of the number of fractures ( joints)
per run, and calculation of their frequency converting it to per metre of rock (known as fracture
frequency), the type of rock and its conditions, the fault or shear zones (from cores of clay, gouge),
etc. Figure 11.21 illustrates drill hole log used to record the complete data regarding rock cores
and the result of water pumping test (see Section 11.8). The driller also maintains a record of
runwise core recovery and other important features that had been encountered during drilling.

Fig. 11.21 Example of geological log of rock cores obtained from a deep drill hole
It is important that the logging of the cores is preceded by a reconnaissance of the area
covering the drill hole location to obtain a fi rst-hand knowledge of the geological set-up.
An engineering geologist working in a project for the fi rst time should never log the rock
cores without visiting the drill hole site. The presence of a geologist during drilling helps to
understand the signifi cance of certain observations. A fall of drill rod without cutting indicates
the presence of fi ssures. In a karstic terrain, it suggests the existence of a solution cavity at
depth. Sudden outfl ow of water under pressure is indicative of an artesian condition. It is to be
ensured by the engineering geologist that the cores are kept systematically in the core boxes and
there is no mix-up during the transportation from site to core library.

256 ● Engineering Geology
In addition to the geological logging of rock cores and providing percolation test
results as shown in Fig. 11.21, a schematic presentation of the data as in Fig. 11.22 is also
necessary. The most common weak features of rocks are the joints, faults, and shearing.
In the engineering geological investigation of subsurface rock conditions, such schematic
representation of rock core recovery, fracture frequency, and water pumping test results is
important for understanding the weakness of rocks including fault zones at depths. High loss
through rocks between specifi c depths indicates that the rock of that section has been affected
by excessive jointing or shattering due to fault. For example, the schematic presentation of
log of a drill hole of a dam site showing high core loss, excessive fracturing, and very high
water loss between dephs 10.5 m and 12.0 m is indicative of a shear zone or a fault zone
(Fig. 11.22).

11.7.8 Measurement of Water Table from Drill Holes
Drill holes may serve as piezometers in the study of a groundwater basin. Seepage from a
reservoir or a dam foundation and sudden rush of water during tunnel or powerhouse
constructions are some of the problems associated with groundwater level in the project sites.
In hard rocks, the groundwater level is measured from uncased hole provided with an automatic
recorder. It can also be measured by simply inserting a tape in a borehole. The top part of the
overburden material is, however, kept cased and a cap is provided at the top. In soft rocks, the
entire length of the borehole is kept cased, except the last 3 m or so covered by a perforated pipe
allowing free fl ow of water. The measurement is taken from time to time throughout the year
to measure the seasonal fl uctuations. Several such measurements in boreholes of a project area
covering the reservoir spread reveal the characteristics of the groundwater table and its gradient
and fl ow direction.
Drill holes are used for tracer study using chemical and radioactive tracers related to the
problem of reservoir competency (Section 15.6) and also to solve post-construction stage
problems. Borehole camera installed in a hole furnishes important information on the fracture
pattern and joint intensity of rocks at depth. In many of the tunnel and power projects, especially
in the Himalayan region, extensometers are widely used through boreholes to measure the
stress condition in rocks to fulfi l the design requirement.

11.8 WATER PUMPING TESTS—APPROACH AND UTILITY
Water pumping test is taken up to measure the permeability of rocks at depth and to assess
potential seepage through porous and jointed rocks of tunnels, underground powerhouses, and
other subsurface structures. A perforated tube fi tted with two rubber packers at the two ends is
lowered to the depth through the drill hole in which the test is to be done. Tests are conducted in
1.5 m to 3 m sections. Water from a tank is pumped to the test section under varying pressures.
A pressure gauge and a water meter record the applied pressure and water loss, respectively.
The most essential factor to be considered for this test is the use of the right type of packer,
which can be tightly fi xed to the rock wall of the drill hole. The quantum of water that permeates
through the rock fractures in a test section per minute should be the same in the consecutive
minute, provided there is uninterrupted fl ow. In practice, the test is conducted for 5 to 10 minutes,
and the average value per minute of fl ow is taken so that in the case of clay fi lling in joints, it will
be fl ushed off during the testing process. Recordings of water losses are done under increasing
and decreasing order of pressures such as 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 kg/cm2. Loss of water is generally
expressed in Lugeon (1 Lugeon = water loss of 1 litre per metre per minute under 10 kg/cm2
pressure). Figure 11.23 shows the results (water loss in Lugeons) of water pumping test conducted
in the hard rock of a dam site through different drill holes A-5, D-4, and K-8 applying pressures
from 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 kg/cm2 in increasing (fi rm line) and decreasing (dotted line) orders.

The most common weak features of hard rocks are the joints, faults, and shearing of rock,
which create passage for permeation of water. Water pumping test result gives the permeability
characteristic of rocks and helps to understand the adverse features in rocks due to jointing and
shattering. In Fig. 11.23, the study of the water pumping test result through the drill hole K-8
provides evidence of the presence of a weak zone. The pumping test also suggests that the clay
(or clay gouge) was fl ushed off during increasing order of pressure testing in hole K-8; however,
during reverse order of pressure testing, high water loss resulted even at a low pressure indicating
a weak zone in rock (fault or open joints) partially fi lled with clay. Figure 11.24 is an example
where two drill holes (R–1 and D–6) accompanied by water pumping tests give clear evidence of
a wide fault zone at the river section of the Umling dam site in Meghalaya. The presence of this
fault was earlier inferred from the geological mapping of the dam site (Gangopadhyay 1981).

12.1 INTRODUCTION
This chapter deals with the different types of construction materials used in
engineering structures. It provides an elaborate description of naturally occurring
materials such as rocks, pebbles, gravels, sands, and clays, which are good
construction materials. The chapter also furnishes details of use of rocks as
blocks for masonry constructions and small fragments as road metals and railway
ballasts and discusses the utilization of river pebbles, gravel, sand, and crushed
stones for concrete aggregates. It gives an account of pozzolan, a naturally
occurring material, and fl y ash, an artifi cial product obtained from factory
rejects,which are both used in concrete to reduce cement consumption. The
chapter further analyses the importance of petrological testing of aggregates to
fi nd whether they contain alkali-reactive minerals and other deleterious materials
and delineates the source of construction materials in India and their exploration
methods.
12.2 PRINCIPAL TYPES OF CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS
The earth’s surface contains vast reserves of varieties of materials such as rock and
soil. These naturally occurring materials have been used for construction purposes
from time immemorial. Civil constructions such as dams, bridges, embankments,
highways, roads, and airports require large quantities of materials obtained from
natural sources. The types and quantity of construction material to be used in a civil

project depend on the engineering design of the specifi c structures. The following are the
common types of naturally occurring materials used in civil engineering constructions:
(i) Rock (dimension stones and crushed stones)
(ii) Cobble, pebbles, and gravel (coarse aggregate)
(iii) Sand (fi ne aggregate)
(iv) Soil and clay
(v) Pozzolan
Rocks are the naturally occurring materials that are most abundantly used in civil
constructions. Hard and durable rocks free from deleterious materials are selected for use as
dimension stones or crushed stones. Boulder, cobble, shingle, gravel, sand, and silt are the
products of rock erosion and are available in plenty in river valleys and other recent deposits
for their use as aggregates (Fig. 12.1). Soil and
clay used in the construction of an earth dam
occur as capping of parent rock or as deposit of
transported materials. Volcanic rock is the source
of natural pozzolan used as partial substitute of
cement. Kankar, which contains lime, has surface
occurrence in many parts of North India and are
used as mortar in house constructions. Artifi cial
materials that are used for construction purposes
include industrial waste (fl y ash), burnt shale,
and brick including surki (powdered brick).
In addition, iron, steel, and cement are other
important materials used in various engineering
Fig. 12.1 Source of construction materials from river
constructions. Iron ore that occurs in geological
terrace deposits: gravel, sand, and boulders
formations is required to extract iron and make
steel. Cement is manufactured from limestone. Mixing of cement with aggregate and water
in a fi xed proportion yields concrete, which is as hard as rock and is used in a multitude of
civil constructions such as dams, buildings, and roads. Instead of concrete, colcrete is used in
some places in the construction of dams, weirs, and barrages. The process of making colcrete
involves the preparation of a watery mixture of cement and sand, which acts like a colloidal
paste immiscible with external water, and then mixing this colloidal paste with stone chips
under pressure.
12.3 CHARACTERISTICS AND USAGE OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF CONSTRUCTION
MATERIALS
Hard and durable materials are available abundantly from natural sources for use as construction
materials for buildings or other engineering structures. Hard rocks are generally used as
blocks for masonry works and by crushing them to meet the construction needs. Many of the
construction materials are also received from artifi cial sources such as factory waste (fl y ash)
for different types of construction purposes as stated below.
12.3.1 Dimension Stones for Building Stone, Facing Stone, and Decoration
Dimension stones are large irregular blocks of rock that are obtained from rock quarry faces.
Dense rocks with low porosity and high strength but amenable to dressing and polishing are good
Chapter_12.indd 262 10/18/2012 5:20:05 PM
Construction Materials ● 263
dimension stones suitable for use as facing stone of walls, building stone for houses, and the like.
In general, dimension stones are hard and durable enough to withstand natural wear and tear.
Ideally, these stones should be resistant to fi re, heat, water, and wind action. The rocks are quarried
from selected parts of hill slopes by mild blasting that produces large blocks of rock of uniform
character. Special techniques of rock splitting are followed to procure even-surfaced large slabs.
Once the dimension stones are obtained from the quarry face, these are cut and dressed to pieces of
specifi c size and shape according to the construction need. For use in walls and fl oors of buildings,
big blocks of rocks are nowadays sliced by diamond saw to various thickness and rectangular or
square shapes and then given a mirror-like polish. In some buildings, leaf, creeper, animal, and
human fi gures are carved in the stone blocks before using them to decorate the building walls.
Dimension stones are mainly used as building stones for construction of entire buildings
or to cover parts of buildings. In historic times, many buildings, royal palaces, huge pillars,
and religious edifi ces were built of large slabs or blocks of dimension stones. The irregular
stone slabs obtained from the quarry face were fi rst dressed into rectangular slabs or blocks
and then used in the masonry works of the buildings. The mortar used for bonding the slabs
includes plastic clay, lime (obtained from burnt shell or kankar), surki (powdered brick), and
other indigenous materials such as cowdung and molasses. Use of stone blocks for constructing
buildings is not popular nowadays, except in some religious and prestigious buildings.
Today, most buildings in cities use reinforced concrete or bricks for their constructions.
However, dimension stones such as large dressed blocks of granite and marble with mirror-like
polish are still widely used for surface covering of important buildings to provide an aesthetic
appearance. Until the early parts of twentieth century, large quantities of rocks of different
sizes obtained from quarrying hard durable rocks were used as rubbles for masonry dam
construction. In general, the irregular rock blocks are properly sized by hand dressing before
use for masonry work. The construction of masonry dams has been reduced in recent times with
consequent reduction in quarrying dimension stones for use as masonry blocks. Large quantities
of dimension stones in the form of even-surfaced slabs are used for pavement purposes in
highways. Dimensional stones (Fig. 12.2) are also used in the protective work of river banks, sea
coasts, and harbours against erosion by river or sea water.
During historic times, there was a spur of
activity in constructing numerous edifi ces and
royal buildings in many parts of the world using
excellent quality dimension stones (building
stones) such as pink granite, white marble,
and red sandstone possessing high strength.
Monolithic blocks of huge dimensions were
carved and placed in the gateways and walls of
many historic monuments. In India, hundreds
of monuments built through the ages by varied
types of building stones can be seen even
today withstanding the vagaries of nature. It
can be safely presumed they will remain for
several more centuries, bearing testimony to
the profound knowledge of our ancient builders
in the choice of rocks for building purposes

The mauve-coloured Vindhyan sandstones are
excellent building stones (Fig.12.3) that were used
in many historic buildings and are still being used
for decorating building walls and fl oors. The milk
white Makrana marble of Rajasthan, which was
used in the Taj Mahal, is extensively mined for
prestigious building constructions and carving.
Blocks of granite and gneiss of huge dimensions
mined from peninsular India are today exported
to foreign countries such as the US. These blocks
are sliced into various sizes and polished to
Fig.12.3 Dressed blocks of Vindhyan sandstone obtain a glittering surface (see Fig. 2.5) and are
widely used in constructing ancient buildings and then marketed to be used in facing of building
other masonry works entrances and for other decorative purposes.
12.3.2 Crushed Stones for Road Metal, Railway Ballasts, and Rip-rap
Crushed stones are irregular rock fragments generally of smaller sizes compared to dimension
stones. The rock chunks obtained from blasting quarry faces are further crushed and screened
into proper sizes depending upon the nature of utilization. In fact, a rock quarry may produce
large rock chunks as well as small fragments, with the large blocks being used as dimension
stones and small fragments as crushed stones with or without further crushing. Good strength
and high durability are the two primary characteristics that crushed stone pieces must possess
for use in any engineering construction. The mineralogical character, texture, and packing of
mineral grains in rocks are responsible for the strength and durability properties of crushing
stones.
Crushed stones are mainly used as railway ballasts, stone chips for highways, roads, airports,
and coarse aggregates of concrete. In roads and airports where stone chips are used in the
bases and sub-bases, the stones withstand the stress due to fast-moving and heavy wheel loads
in the structural design of the pavement. The action of repeated wheel loads due to wheel
movement tends to cause impact and abrasion of the stone. It is therefore important that the
crushed stones used for road construction have high strength and durability. Large quantities
of hard and sound crushed stones or fragmented rocks of varying dimensions are required for
constructing rock-fi ll dams where adequate supply of materials such as boulders, pebbles, and
gravels are not available from local sources. Fragmented rocks are also used as rip-rap materials
to cover the upstream faces of earth dams for protection from erosion due to water action. The
10 m layer of rip-rap material for 206 m-high Tehri rock-fi ll dam located in Uttaranchal (Lesser
Himalayas) used blasted or crushed large dimension quartzite boulders for its upstream slope
protection.
12.3.3 Suitability of Rocks for Engineering Construction
The mere presence of hard rock in a hill slope or surface outcrop does not indicate the suitability
of the rock for construction purposes. Field study is necessary to fi nd its structural behaviour
and weathering condition. Rock outcrops with excessive planes of discontinuities and highly
weathered rocks are not suitable for engineering construction. The behaviour of the rock
under varied conditions is the foremost consideration in fi nding its suitability for construction
purposes. In general, suitability is determined from laboratory tests of rock properties that
include density, porosity, permeability, and strength. The mineralogical and textural properties
Chapter_12.indd 264 10/18/2012 5:20:05 PM
Construction Materials ● 265
determined from petrological studies are also considered in the selection of construction materials
(Fig. 12.4). In general, the rock types that possess high strength and durability are suitable for use
as construction materials. However, some rocks contain excessive deleterious materials including
chemically reactive minerals and these are considered unsuitable for engineering constructions.
Strong and durable rocks for use as dimension stones or crushed stones for various engineering
(a) (b)
Fig. 12.4 Thin sections of rock (× 70) under microscope showing deleterious minerals:
(a) schistose rock with chemically reactive minerals; and (b) sandstone possessing large
percentage of weathered biotite and iron oxide
constructions are obtained in plenty from igneous and metamorphic rock suites. Igneous rocks
such as granite, charnockite, basalt, and dolerite and metamorphic rocks such as gneiss, quartzite,
quartzitic phyllite, and khondalite are suffi ciently dense and have low absorption and high
compressive strength. These rocks are widely used in engineering constructions of buildings,
dams, roads, and airports. In the absence of very strong and durable rocks, moderately strong
rocks such as schist, phyllite, slate, dolomite, sandstone, and limestone are also used for various
construction purposes depending upon the design requirement.
In selecting quarry site for rocks, the locally available outcrops of hard and durable rocks
are considered fi rst. If suitable rocks are not available locally, they are to be brought from a
distant place, provided it is economically viable for the project. In some cases, the design of
the structure is changed when stones are not available locally. The absence of suitable rocks
resulted in the change in the design of the Gumti dam in Tripura in favour of a brick–concrete
structure using burnt bricks manufactured from locally available sandy soil.
12.3.4 Aggregates for Concrete
Aggregate is used to make concrete by mixing with cement and different types of naturally
obtained materials such as gravels and sand to meet the requirements of different types of
construction works. The materials used should be such that its strength achieved after making
concrete will have suffi cient bearing strength to withstand the structure. The material used
should not be deleterious in nature such as chalcedony, chert, strained quartz, and so on.
Generally, aggregate used may be coarse or fi ne depending upon the need as detailed below.
Coarse aggregates Aggregates constituted of cobble, pebble, gravel, and sand (Fig.12.5)
are mixed with Portland cement in varied proportions by weight to make concrete. The size
fractions of aggregates and their proportions are selected such that there remains no void after
setting of the concrete with cement. The quality of the aggregate materials is the main deciding
factor to achieve the desired strength of concrete. The aggregate should be free from deleterious

Fig.12.5 Aggregate for concrete: (a) deposit of cobbles and pebbles; and (b) sieved heap of

materials including cement-reactive minerals. The principal engineering properties considered in
selecting concrete aggregate include crushing strength, impact, abrasion, and soundness values.
Recent deposits of cobbles and shingles derived from hard and durable rocks are the natural
sources of coarse aggregate for concrete. These materials are obtained in profuse quantity from
river valleys, terraces, and glacial deposits. In addition, crushed rocks are also used as coarse
aggregates. Irrespective of the source of the materials, their properties are determined from the
results of laboratory tests including petrographic study to decide their suitability for aggregate.
The bulk materials for aggregate obtained from river deposits or crushed stones are screened to
different size fractions according to design specifi cation prior to their use in concrete.
The quality of the coarse aggregates varies from place to place depending upon the source
rocks from which these have been derived. Terrains of igneous and metamorphic rocks
comprising granite, basalt, dolerite, gneiss, quartzite, and marble are the main sources of
good quality coarse aggregate materials obtained from river deposits as well as crushed rocks.
Erosion and transportation are two prime factors associated with formations of the deposits of
aggregate materials. Riverborne coarse aggregate materials having round and smooth surfaces
are favoured for engineering use. This is because they consume less cement and have better
bonding capacity compared to crushed rocks having angular and uneven surfaces.
Construction material survey in parts of Yamuna basin could fi nd suffi cient quantity of
suitable quality aggregate for the Lakhwar Vyasi dam (Fig. 12.6). In general, deposits of coarse
aggregate including pebbles originated from mica schists or of glacial origin carry a lot of silt
and clay particles. However, if the available quantity of the pebble and gravel is not adequate
enough, or if these materials are not available at all, crushed rocks are used to meet the demand
of coarse aggregate after screening and washing of the clay coating. In the 90 m-high Rihand
dam (gravity dam) in Uttar Pradesh, the requirement of 1.7 million cubic metres of coarse
aggregate for concrete was met using crushed rock by quarrying a hill of gneissic granite at a
distance of 5 km from the dam site (Rao 1975).
Fine aggregates Deposits of sand are generally abundant in river valleys. An igneous terrain
gives rise to coarse-grained sands consisting mostly of quartz, feldspar, and some other hard
minerals. Good quality sands are also produced from metamorphic rocks containing micas
in addition to quartz and feldspars. However, sedimentary rocks produce deposits with more
clayey materials that need to be removed before use as aggregate material. In general, sand and
gravel deposits contain deleterious materials such as organic matter (coal, peat), clay lump,

Construction Materials ● 267

soft shale, and micas in varying quantities. According to Indian Standard (IS), these deleterious
materials should be less than 5 per cent by weight of the total materials. Screening and washing
of the sands are generally taken up to reduce the deleterious materials by removing the fi ne clay
and mica particles.
Wherever required, quartz sands obtained from crushed quartzite are blended with river sand and
gravel to improve their quality by lowering the percentage of very fi ne particles such as silt, clay, and
micas. In the Umiam project of Meghalaya, the sand deposits were found to contain exceptionally
high percentage of micas derived from the country rocks such as phyllite and schist. It was diffi cult
to fi nd a suitable quality of fi ne aggregate for concrete. Screening and washing could not bring
down the mica content of the river sand to the required level. Quartzite available from a local hill
was then quarried and crushed to the requisite size and blended with the river sand to get the right
proportion. Similarly, in the Little Rangit Project of Sikkim, the presence of a high percentage of
mica (nearly 14 per cent) and suffi cient amount of clay and silt (about 3 per cent) in the sand of the
river bed made it necessary to blend crushed quartzite with it to use as fi ne aggregate for concrete.
12.3.5 Soil and Clay
Weathering and decomposition of rocks produce soil and clay, which are in large demand in
engineering construction of earth dams, embankments, and bases of roads and airports. Depending
on the water-retaining capacity, soils on earth’s surface may be of pervious, semi-pervious, or
impervious type. Pervious soil is constituted of homogeneous material free from large voids,
will not consolidate excessively under the superincumbent weight of the fi ll, and has high angle
of internal friction, low cohesive strength, and permeability (K ) greater than 50 × 10 −4 cm/sec.

268 ● Engineering Geology
Semi-pervious soil has medium cohesion, medium angle of internal friction, and medium
permeability, with K varying from 0.01 × 10−4 cm/sec to 50 × 10−4 cm/sec. The impervious
soil on the other hand possess low angle of internal friction, high cohesive strength, and low
permeability (K less than 0.01 × 10−4 cm/sec. Impervious soil is free from potential path of
percolation. It does not allow water loss through it and will not consolidate excessively under
the weight of the superincumbent fi ll.
Clayey soil or clay The clayey soil is used in the construction of embankments, retaining
walls, and abutments. More than 50 per cent particles of clayey soil or clay are less than two
microns in size. Clay is constituted of either non-clay minerals such as quartz, feldspar, calcite,
and mica or clay minerals such as kaolinite, illite, and montmorillonite. Clay minerals require
study by the methods of X-ray diffraction or differential thermal analysis (DTA) or examination
under electronic microscope for their proper identifi cation.
Clay minerals are crystalline hydrated silicates of aluminium. In some clay minerals, sodium,
iron, and magnesium may be present. The clayey soil constituted of large percentage of clay minerals
exhibit high plasticity, low shearing strength, and volume change (swelling) when saturated with
water. When this type of soil with swelling behaviour is used in engineering constructions such
as embankments, it may result in settlement in the body of the fi ll and slope failure in saturated
condition. Hence, while selecting borrow areas of clay for an engineering structure, the quality of
the clay especially with respect to its expansive nature needs to be thoroughly studied.
Clayey soil or clay has distinctive origin. Clayey soil such as the black cotton soil occupies
surface areas of large parts of central and south India. Such clay deposits may extend to a depth
of 3 m to 10 m. Clayey soil is found in deltaic deposits of the river Ganga and other rivers such
as the Godavari and Cauvery. Clay also occurs in extensive areas of the eastern and western
coasts including lake (still water) deposits. Table 12.1 provides the typical analytical result of
clayey soil or clay of different origins.

12.3.6 Pozzolan
Pozzolan is a naturally occurring substance consisting of siliceous or aluminous minerals. It
has no cementitious value in itself, but when mixed with lime it becomes cementitious. It reacts
with lime at atmospheric temperature in the presence of water to produce a hard cementitious
compound. This cheap substance is mixed with cement to reduce the consumption of cement
in concrete and thus lower the cost of concrete. It also retards the alkali–aggregate reaction
when mixed with Portland cement in a fi xed proportion. The other benefi ts of using pozzolan
include increased watertightness, lower shrinkage possibility, diminished heat of hydration, and
improved resistance to attack from sulphate soil and to cracking.
Volcanic ash, tuff, diatomaceous earth, chert, and pumice stone are naturally occurring
pozzolans. It has been found that kaolinitic clay develops good pozzolanic property on
calcination at the optimum temperature of 600–700°C, provided it is not gritty. Clay and shale
Chapter_12.indd 268 10/18/2012 5:20:08 PM
Construction Materials ● 269
of certain geological formations depending upon their mineralogical characters show good
pozzolanic characteristics on calcination at varied temperatures. Clays consisting predominantly
of montmorillonite and illite need a temperature range of 700–800°C and 900–1000°C,
respectively, to obtain optimum reactivity similar to pozzolan. All these natural materials are
ground to powder before adding to cement in a predetermined proportion for making concrete.
When used as a replacement of cement up to 20–25 per cent, it has been found that, similar
to clays, natural pozzolans after calcination will retain all desirable qualities of concrete. In
Bhakra concrete dam in Punjab, Siwalik clay stone that develops a pozzolan character after
calcination at 871°C was used. This reduced the cement consumption in concrete up to 20 per
cent without deterioration in the quality of concrete.
In India, Deccan traps of volcanic origin contain beds of ash and tuff that are used as pozzolans.
Volcanic ash and pumice are also found in Barren and Nicobar Islands. Diatomaceous earth and
radiolarian chert have been reported from Andaman Islands. Sedimentary formations such as
Cuddapah, Vindhyan, Gondwana, and Tertiary formations including Siwalik possess clay and
shale having pozzolanic properties. However, shale and clay beds of all these formations are
not equally reactive. Fuller’s earth and bentonitic clay of pozzolanic character occur in Malani
Rhyolite of Rajasthan and in parts of Jammu and Srinagar. The kaolinitic clay formed from the
decomposition of pegmatite and porphyritic granite occurs in Archaean rocks in different parts
of India. In addition, lithomarge and low-grade bauxite of Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Jammu
and Kashmir are also utilized as pozzolans.
12.3.7 Fly Ash (Artifi cial Pozzolan)
In addition to natural occurrence, pozzolans are available from artifi cial sources such as
industrial waste, blast furnace slag, calcined clay or shale, and ground brickbats called surki.
The leftover burnt coal of thermal plants is the ash that is known as fl y ash in its industrial use.
It is grey in colour resembling the colour of cement and the fi neness of particles (< 63 microns)
is also similar to that of cement. Fly ash is constituted of silica, alumina, and iron oxide in major
quantities and calcium oxide and water-soluble salts in minor quantities. In fact, its chemical
and mineralogical compositions are similar to natural pozzolan. Fly ash is well utilized when
obtained from thermal plants close to the project area. This industrial waste, which is commonly
heaped up at the backyard of the plants, can be procured very cheaply.
Analysis of six fl y ash samples from Nellore thermal plant in Andhra Pradesh shows quartz,
feldspar, and iron oxide as the main mineral contents, with average specifi c gravity 2.09 and
compressive strength (lime reactivity) 36.4 kg/cm2. The chemical analyses of three samples
show that the oxides and salts present in fl y ash are well within the specifi ed limit of its use with
Portland cement in a predetermined proportion for making concrete. The study result indicated
that the fl y ash if mixed in suitable proportions, replacing cement up to 20 per cent, does not
change the strength or quality of concrete in any way but registered reduced sulphate attack,
increased water tightness, and resistance to cracking. Moreover, the strength of the mortar
using 20 per cent fl y ash surpasses the mortar strength without fl y ash after 90 days of curing
(Lingam, Narasimhulu, and Ramakrishna 1968).
12.4 LABORATORY TESTS OF AGGREGATES WITH INDIAN STANDARD SPECIFICATION
Engineering properties such as crushing strength, impact, abrasion, and soundness values of
aggregate materials are determined from the results of laboratory tests. The methods of tests are
briefl y stated in the following subsections.
Chapter_12.indd 269 10/18/2012 5:20:08 PM
270 ● Engineering Geology
12.4.1 Aggregate Crushing Test
Aggregate crushing test measures the resistance capacity of the aggregate under static load.
Determination of crushing strength involves the crushing of the material by compression in the
laboratory. The aggregate material of size range 12.5–10 mm is taken in a 150 mm-diameter
steel mould up to a depth of 100 mm and subjected to a universal compressive load of 40
tonnes. The loading is continued for 10 minutes and the weight of the fi nes passing through
the 2 mm-mesh sieve is measured. If the original weight of the test sample is A and the weight
of the crushed materials (less than 2 mm in size) is B, the crushing value of the aggregate is
obtained from the simple calculation, (B/A) × 100. Thus, the percentage loss of the material due
to crushing making fi nes or powdery material (less than 2 mm in size) is the measure of the
resistance to crushing. A low value of aggregate crushing test implies that the material has good
resistance capacity. If this value is less than 10 per cent, the aggregate material is very strong,
but if the value is more than 35 per cent, it is considered to be weak.
12.4.2 Aggregate Impact Test
The aggregate impact test determines the aggregate impact value, which is a relative measure
of resistance of an aggregate to sudden shock or impact. This value of resistance due to sudden
impact generally differs from that obtained from slow compressive load applied in aggregate
crushing test. The impact testing machine consists of a steel cup of 100 mm internal diameter
and 50 mm depth and is provided with a steel hammer weighing 13.5–14 kg. The hammer
slides freely between vertical guides so arranged that the lower (cylindrical) part of the hammer
is above and concentric with the steel cup.
The aggregate impact value is obtained by testing the aggregate material that passes a
12.5 mm-mesh sieve and is retained over a 10 mm-mesh sieve. The sample is dried in an oven
between 100°C and 110°C for four hours, cooled, and then weighed. The weighed sample of
aggregate is taken in the cup of the impact testing machine and pounded by the steel hammer
through 15 blows from a standard height of 380 mm. The weight of the powdery material
passing through the 2.36 mm IS sieve is then measured accurately. This provides the weight
loss of the test sample under impact. The percentage of this weight loss with respect to the
original weight of the aggregate material gives the aggregate impact value.
12.4.3 Los Angeles Abrasion Test
Los Angeles abrasion test is intended to determine the abrasive resistance of aggregate materials
such as gravel, sand, and crushed rock. It measures the percentage loss by weight of a standard
sample after it is subjected to abrasion in the Los Angeles machine. This machine consists of a
hollow steel cylinder of inside diameter 750 mm and inside height 500 mm and having several
steel balls (48 mm diameter and weighing about 400 g) inside for abrading purpose. Bulk
sample is fi rst sieved into different size fractions. The quantity of the material to be charged
and the number of steel balls to be placed inside the machine are decided according to the size
range of the test sample.
Aggregate of 2.5 kg and 11 steel balls are required for testing 12.5–10 mm-size and
20–12.5 mm-size samples. The measured quantity of 2.5 kg aggregate (size 12.5–10.0 mm)
is taken for test. The sample is washed thoroughly in water, dried in an oven between 105°C
and 110°C, cooled, and then placed inside the cylinder and rotated at 30 to 33 revolutions
per minute (rpm) until 5000 revolutions are completed. The percentage of abraded material

Construction Materials ● 271
(powdery material) by weight passing through 1.70 mm IS sieve in terms of total weight gives
the abrasion value. The abrasion value is high in soft material and low in hard aggregate.
12.4.4 Deval Abrasion (or Attrition) Test
Deval abrasion test measures the resistance to wear of the aggregate material when subjected
to abrasion under rotational condition. In this test, the sample weighing 5kg is divided into
two equal parts of 12.5–10 mm and 20–12.5 mm size range. Then, 2.5kg sample of the coarser
fraction is dried in an oven, cooled, and then placed in 30° inclined buckets. It is then rotated
at 30 rpm for 3 minutes. The portion of the abraded sample remaining in the pan below the
2 mm IS sieve is collected and measured. The loss of the particles expressed as a percentage
loss of the original sample gives the abrasion value as in the Los Angeles abrasion test. At least
two tests are conducted and their average value is taken.
12.4.5 Soundness (or Sodium Sulphate) Test
Soundness test is intended to fi nd the ability of the aggregate to restrict weathering. A saturated
solution of sodium sulphate is prepared (dissolving 350g of anhydrous sodium sulphate in
1 l of water) and kept for at least 48 hours before use. The test is conducted on both coarse
and fi ne aggregates (gravel and sand). The bulk sample of aggregate is fi rst sieved to different
fractions such as 10–4.75 mm, 4.74–2.00 mm, 2.00–0.425 mm, and 0.425–0.075 mm. About
115g of sample is necessary for one test of fi ne aggregate but heavier samples are needed for
coarser fractions.
An aggregate sample of 10.0–4.75 mm fraction is taken for testing. The sample is washed
in water, then dried at a temperature of 110°C, and cooled at room temperature. A measured
quantity of 100g aggregate is immersed in sodium sulphate solution taken in a porcelain bowel.
After saturation for 18 hours, the sulphate solution is decanted and the sample is thoroughly
washed with water. A few drops of barium chloride (BaCl ) is mixed with the sample and
2
washed with water to clean the sodium sulphate coating from the sample. The sample is then
dried, cooled, and the test repeated. In this way, after fi ve cycles of the test, the sample is
fi nally washed, dried, and sieved in a 4.75 mm IS sieve. The portion passing through the sieve
indicates the weight loss of the sample. The percentage weight loss (fi ve-cycle test) with respect
to the weight of the original sample is a measure of soundness. Results of tests conducted in
geotechnical laboratories of the Geological Survey of India (GSI) for crushing values, Los
Angeles abrasion, and impact and soundness values of aggregate materials (crushed rocks or
river gravels) of various rock types used in different projects in India are given in Table 12.2.

12.5 MATERIALS FOR USE AS RAILWAY BALLAST AND ROAD METAL
Hard and durable rocks that can resist abrasion and wearing are generally suitable for railway
ballast. There are several types of rocks such as basalt, granite, and charnockite that are used for
railway ballasts as these possess properties specifi ed by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS)
and Indian Railway Standard (IRS). The details are further discussed below.
12.5.1 Suitable Rock Types and Desired Properties
Hard rocks with good strength are crushed to obtain suitable size pieces for use as railway
ballasts. The process includes screening of the crushed rocks to obtain the desired size fraction.
The remaining size fractions including fi nes and dusts and associated weeds are removed. The
size and the thickness of the ballast layers to be placed for rail line depend on the nature
of the railway tracks, that is, whether broad gauge (BG), medium gauge (MG), or narrow
gauge (NG),which decides the load factor and thrust on the ballasts. The bearing capacity of
the subgrade materials and drainage arrangement are given important consideration during
placing the rail. The unit weight, dry density, compressive strength, impact, abrasion, and other
properties of the ballasts are determined from laboratory tests (see Sections 12.4.1 and 12.4.4)
before their placement. The most desired characteristics of the ballasts are the resistance to
impact and the bearing capacity to sudden thrust, which are imposed by the moving engine and
loaded wagons. The railway ballasts should also have resistance to wear and tear or abrasion.
The desired impact and abrasive properties specifi ed by Indian Railway Standard (IRS) are
given in Section 12.5.2.
The rocks mostly used as broken pieces for road metals must be very hard, tough, and
resistant to abrasion. Hardness is indicative of the power of resistance and toughness implies the
capacity to withstand impact. Abrasion is related to the power of resisting forces from grinding
and fracturing. Road metals of good quality will be such that with the movement of loaded
vehicles or trains, there will be no grinding of the stone chips used and no crack will develop
in the road. The material to be used as road aggregate should also have good binding capacity.
Section 12.5.2 provides the required specifi cation of abrasion, impact, and other properties of
road metals fi xed by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). Basic igneous rocks such as basalt
found in the Deccan traps, Rajmahal Hills, and many other parts of India are best for use as
Chapter_12.indd 272 10/18/2012 5:20:08 PM
Construction Materials ● 273
dimension stone and chips for road construction. The rock is very hard and dense for use for
macadam and tarred roads (see Section 19.2).
Basalt and dolerite broken to size are also used as good quality railway ballast. Granite, gneiss,
charnockite, basalt, dolerite, sandstone with siliceous matrix (such as Vindhyan sandstone),
quartzose phyllite, and so on, which are available in most parts of India in abundant quantities,
provide good quality railway ballasts and also serve as good road metals. The engineering
properties of these rocks are shown in Table 10.1. High strength and low absorption as seen
in the tested samples indicate that they are good quality construction materials for use as road
metals and also very tough and hence are suitable for use as railway ballasts. Some siliceous
varieties of schists, limestone, and dolomite can also be used when available locally, but if
micaceous materials are present in high percentage and easily erodible and soluble matters
occur in suffi ciently high percentage in limestone and dolomite, they should not be used. In
fact, the stone chips for use as road metals as well as rail ballasts are selected depending upon
the local availability and their suitability as per standard specifi cation.

Table 12.3 provides the standard for aggregate fi xed by BIS (No. 6579–1981) and Indian Road
Congress (IRC) (1988) for use in road construction and that fi xed by Indian Railways for use
as railway ballasts.

Extensive gravel (shingle) deposits available from two sources, namely Murti river bed and
Jaldhaka streams, were selected for use as aggregates for the Jaldhaka project of North Bengal.
The study of the shingles indicated the weighed percentage of each rock type in Murti shingles
to be quartzite 34.8 per cent, vein quartz 12.2 per cent, phyllite 21 per cent, gneiss 22.5 per cent,

quality (Table 12.4) but Murti aggregates were used in maximum quantity without any crushing

Of the various Indian rocks, basalt and dolerite are abundantly used as road metals and railway
ballasts because of their wide availability and their characteristics such as high specifi c gravity,
low water absorption, and high compressive strength (see Table 10.1). The crushing, abrasion,
impact, and fl akiness index values are also well within the BIS and IRC specifi cations. Lateritic
rock of comparatively low strength that occurs in many places in India as capping of basic rocks
are also used in highway and road constructions when available locally. Several samples of
laterite tested for road construction purposes show that its abrasion value is 39.0–58.5 per cent,
crushing value is 32.5–46.1 per cent and impact value is 26.8–45.1 per cent. These values are
within the specifi ed limit for use as road metal as shown in the Table 12.3.
12.6 DELETERIOUS MATERIALS AND ALKALI–AGGREGATE REACTION
Concrete is made by adding cement to aggregate materials (crushed rocks gravel, sand, etc.) in
a fi xed proportion to achieve the strength of a hard rock. The quality of the aggregate materials
in concrete mix is the main factor that provides strength to concrete. Deleterious materials are
those rock or mineral particles in aggregate that produce adverse effects on concrete due to their
weak characteristics and chemical reaction with alkali in cement. Some aggregate materials
react with cement in concrete. This cement–aggregate reaction, commonly known as alkali–
aggregate reaction, reduces the strength and durability of the concrete. The alkali–aggregate
reaction produces silica gel, which causes swelling pressure inside the concrete; as a result,
concrete develops cracks necessitating costly repair and even replacement of the engineering
structure.
Silica minerals such as tridymite, cristobalite, opal, chert, chalcedony, and strained quartz
in aggregate materials are primarily responsible for the alkali–aggregate reaction. Crushed
volcanic rocks such as glassy and cryptocrystalline rhyolite, dacite, and andesite and some
varieties of phyllite also react with alkali in cement. Crushed basalt having good strength and
high resistance to abrasion is suitable for use as coarse aggregate for concrete. However, some
varieties, especially the amygdaloidal variety, may contain chloropheite, palagonite, volcanic
ash, chert, and chalcedony that cause alkali–aggregate reaction and are therefore avoided
from use as concrete aggregate. The Rajmahal basalt and the Deccan basalt were safely used
as concrete aggregate in Farakka barrage in West Bengal and Koyna dam in Maharashtra,
respectively, but Deccan basalt around Ukai project of Maharashtra could not be used due to
the presence of excessive alkali-reactive minerals.
In addition to these chemically reactive minerals and rocks, deleterious materials also
include micaceous rocks, shale and friable clayey rocks, sulphide and sulphate minerals, and
Chapter_12.indd 274 10/18/2012 5:20:08 PM
Construction Materials ● 275
organic matter. Gypsum and clay occurring as coating of aggregate material is detrimental to
concrete. Good aggregates are those that possess adequate strength and durability, high density,
low porosity and permeability, and good capability of fi re protection and thermal insulation.
Commonly used materials such as cobbles, gravels, sand, and crushed stones derived from hard
and durable rocks (igneous and metamorphic) are good aggregates. However, gravels and sand
deposits contain certain deleterious materials when derived from sedimentary rocks such as
greywacke. While selecting a site for aggregate materials (crushed rock or river deposit), care
should be taken to ensure that the site does not contain deleterious including cement-reactive
minerals more than the IS-specifi ed limit. In practice, the following actions are taken to solve
the problem of deleterious material in aggregate:
(i) Crushed rock comprising excessive deleterious materials (beyond the permissible limit of
5 per cent) that promote alkali–aggregate reaction should be avoided from use as aggregate
even if the rock is hard and possesses good strength.
(ii) Petrographic study helps to identify the type and content of deleterious materials present
in aggregate including clay and mineral coating. Mica fl akes and coatings of clay,
calcium carbonate, gypsum, and so forth are removable by washing with water. When
these materials are present in aggregate in excess, these are to be removed or reduced to
suffi cient extent by screening and washing with water.
(iii) If signifi cant quantity of alkali-reactive deleterious material is present in the aggregate and
if there is no alternative source to get better quality aggregate, then instead of Portland
cement, low alkali cement, especially pozzolan, is to be used to retard the chemical action.
Blending of some innocuous material brings down the content of the deleterious material
within the specifi ed limit.
12.7 PETROGRAPHIC STUDY OF AGGREGATE
The quality and durability of concrete depend on the type of rocks and minerals present in the
aggregate materials. Petrographic study of aggregate is undertaken to identify the rock types
and minerals present in it with the ultimate aim of identifying the percentage of minerals that
are harmful for the concrete. Materials such as organic matter, calcium carbonate, and gypsum
are considered deleterious. Minerals such as opal, chert, and chalcedony are chemically reactive
with the alkali in cement. Coarse-size aggregate materials are examined visually and with the
help of a hand lens of 10 to 25 times magnifi cation. Fine aggregate (sand) is studied under the
microscope taking the grains under oil immersion or fi xing the grains on a glass slide.
The aggregate materials (crushed rocks or recent deposits) are fi rst sieved into different size
fractions. The weights of individual fractions are taken and the average weight is calculated.
Petrographic study of each fraction is then undertaken. Whenever required, rock pieces, cobble,
pebble, and coarse gravel are fragmented by geological hammer to examine the minerals and
texture. The study includes the following aspects:
(i) Identifying the types of rocks and minerals and their physical characteristics, say, granite
or gneiss—fresh to slightly weathered, strong, and durable—and phyllite or sandstone—
moderately weathered, medium grained, soft. Weak visual and microscopic examination
is conducted if any coating is present and the type of coating such as coal, clay, and silt or
minerals such as calcium carbonate, gypsum, and opal is identifi ed.
(ii) Ascertaining whether the coatings are easily washable by water or requires chemical
treatment is also ascertained. For example, kaoline coating is easily washable by water
but removal of iron stains requires use of chemicals.
Chapter_12.indd 275 10/18/2012 5:20:08 PM
276 ● Engineering Geology
(iii) Observing the particle shape, angularity, and smoothness. In engineering use, round and
smooth surface grains are preferred to angular and uneven surface as the former consumes
less cement.
(iv) Examining the fi xed number of grains (about 200) generally by hand lens (for coarser
particles) and under microscope (for fi ne grains). This is necessary for identifi cation and
percentage determination of alkali-reactive minerals such as chert, chalcedony, and opal.
Special care is taken to ascertain the possible presence of strain quartz.
At the end of the study, it is necessary to make gradation of the materials, such as good,
satisfactory, and poor. Good aggregate should have good strength, good durability, and high
resistive capacity. The satisfactory type aggregate possesses moderate strength and durability
and satisfactory physical character. The poor type contains particles of low strength and poor
durability under climatic condition likely to cause cracking of concrete. The study result is
reported in a tabular form containing factual data with respect to the different rock types.
In addition to natural aggregate materials, petrographic study by optical microscope and/or
scanning electron microscope is undertaken for concrete samples to fi nd if there is any sign of
chemical reaction that may develop after some years, causing cracks in concrete. In general,
the rim of the grains in concrete may show formation of gel or reactive scars or microcracks.
Petrographic study of aggregate material of Sardar Sarovar (Narmada) dam in Gujarat showed a
presence of 90–95 per cent basalt (Deccan) associated with secondary silica, zeolite, and calcite
and rest (5–10%) of granite, quartzite, and sandstone. The aggregate containing deleterious
material content (2.1–3.3%) is well within the limit of safe use. In addition, electron microscope
study of concrete (10 samples) that are 5–10 years old showed no trace of gel or rim formation
suggesting the absence of alkali reaction (Patel and Joshi 2004). Petrographic study of the
concrete of Srisailam dam in Andhra Pradesh led to the conclusion that the aggregate used
contains strained quartz (42.6–58.2%) and the concrete is prone to alkali–aggregate reaction
(Raju 2004).
12.8 SOURCE OF CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS IN INDIA
India is endowed with rich reserves of good quality construction materials spread over different
parts of the country. Each of the three geomorphic divisions of India, namely the peninsular
plateau, the extra-peninsular region, and the Indo-Gangetic plain, has distinctive geological
characteristics with respect to its rock formations and recent deposits (Chapter 24). The
peninsular and extra-peninsular regions contain several hills and mountains incised by deep
valleys. The rock formations of these two regions including the recent deposits of river valleys
are sources of good quality rocks and aggregate used in various civil engineering works of India.
Large tracks of the peninsular plateau and parts of Bihar and Orissa comprise Archaeans,
the oldest rock formations of India. Archaeans produce the best quality construction materials
such as granite, charnockite, gneiss, and khondalite, which can be used as dimension stones or
aggregate after crushing. The rivers of the peninsula containing very thick deposits of gravel
and sand derived from the Archaean rocks provide good source of aggregate materials. More
than 50 concrete and masonry dams constructed in the peninsular plateau have safely used
Archaean rocks for engineering works. The crystalline limestone and marble of different hues
available in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and parts of Mysore provide excellent ornamental
building stones, especially for architectural works of temples and aristocrat buildings.
Next to Archaeans, the rocks in the Deccan traps cover the maximum areas of the peninsula.
Massive basalt, amygdaloidal basalt, agglomerate, and tuff are the main rock types of the
Chapter_12.indd 276 10/18/2012 5:20:08 PM
Construction Materials ● 277
Deccan traps. The Deccan basalt of massive variety can be safely used for aggregate and also
for masonry works, but due to the presence of alkali-reactive minerals, amygdaloidal basalt is
not found suitable for concrete aggregate. The volcanic ash and tuff bed of the Deccan traps are
a good source of pozzolan, which is used as a substitute for cement. The basalts of both Deccan
and Rajmahal Hills are also used as stone chips for road metals and railway ballasts.
Except the Archaeans and Deccan traps, other rock formations of the peninsula include
Cuddapah, Vindhyan, and the Gondwana systems. The Cuddapah system is composed of
metamorphosed sediments such as quartzite, sandstone, limestone, slate, and shale that occupy
a large track of Andhra Pradesh and parts of Madhya Pradesh. The Cuddapah rocks, except
shale, possess high-to-medium strength and hardness and are good for construction purposes.
The Vindhyan system comprising sandstone, limestone, and shale covers most parts of central
India. The Vindhyan sandstone was extensively used in building constructions during historic
times and is also used at present for various engineering constructions including dams and road
pavements. Vindhyan limestone is also utilized in making cement.
The Gondwana rocks consisting of sandstone and shale occur in extensive areas of Eastern and
Central India covering Barakar, Son, and Narmada valleys. The argillaceous sandstone and shale
of Gondwana are soft and are not suitable for construction purpose, but sandstones of siliceous
matrix are suffi ciently hard and durable and can be used in engineering works. The Tawa dam in
Madhya Pradesh used the locally available medium hard Gondwana sandstone for its masonry
construction. Tertiary rocks comprising soft sandstone, shale, and clay stone occur in eastern and
western coasts. Shale and clay stone are used as pozzolans after calcinations. The silty and clayey
soil derived from the tertiary sedimentaries is well suited for construction of earth dams.
The extra-peninsular region (the Himalayan terrain) is characterized by hundreds of ridges
and intersected valleys that contribute vast reserve of rocks and aggregate for engineering
constructions. Metamorphic rocks such as gneiss, schist, quartzite, slate, and phyllite with intrusive
granite are the main rock types of the Lesser Himalayas with plenty of cobbles, gravels, and
sands occurring in river and terrace deposits. Several projects have been completed and some are
under construction using these rocks and the river deposits. Tertiary sedimentary rocks (Siwaliks)
comprising sandstone, limestone, and shale (clay stone) and conglomerate occupy a large track
of the southern fringe of the Himalayas. The Siwalik rocks have low strength and durability and
are not good quality construction materials. Because of lack of availability of suitable aggregate
materials in Siwalik rocks, the Bhakra concrete dam in Punjab used river terrace deposit of nearly
fi ve to eight kilometres downstream of the dam site as concrete aggregate and calcined clay
stone as pozzolan for partial replacement of cement. The deposit of the river Chenab comprising
dolomite and quartzite has been used as aggregate and fi ll material in the construction of Salal dam
in Jammu and Kashmir. The Indo-Gangetic alluvium extends from Assam in the east to Punjab
in the west covering parts of West Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, and Uttar Pradesh. The entire plain is
devoid of rock and coarse aggregate, which would require transportation of these materials from
long distance for construction work in this track. Clayey soil of this alluvial terrain is, however,
suitably used as semi-pervious and impervious materials for earth dams. The sand, silt, and clay
of the alluvium are utilized in making bricks for building constructions.
12.9 EXPLORATION FOR CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS AND SELECTING QUARRY SITES
The topographic feature is a major factor in the exploration for construction materials. Study
of aerial photographs and remote sensing followed by fi eld check help in the understanding of
the geomorphic and geological features of the terrain and the identifi cation of potential sites
of construction materials within a short time. Once the potential sites are located from such
Chapter_12.indd 277 10/18/2012 5:20:08 PM
278 ● Engineering Geology
studies, geological maps are prepared of these sites, delineating areas of rock outcrops, soil, or
overburden cover including the nature of overburden material or soil. Subsurface exploration is
then taken up following different techniques depending upon the depth and types of available
construction materials.The exploration of soil, clay, and aggregate material is confi ned to
shallow subsurface part, but quarry site for stones requires drilling to deeper parts.
Shallow subsurface exploration constitutes pitting and trenching within top 3–6m of soil
or loose river or terrace deposits. Samples of the materials are taken from selected parts of
the pit or trench for laboratory tests. The method of exploration for materials in loose deposits
in deeper parts includes power auger drilling with samplers. The materials collected in the
samplers from different depths are tested for their quality in the laboratory. The quantitative
estimation of construction material is done from a simple calculation based on the available
area and depth of the deposit above the groundwater level. Several holes may need to be
drilled and depth of samples studied to fi nd the suitability of materials and quantity available.
The stability of the site where the construction material is located also needs to be investigated.
12.9.1 Selection of Quarry Sites
Selecting sites for quarrying of rocks requires a systematic approach. A hill face having
exposed rock free from joins and fractures as far as practicable is fi rst selected. If the hill slope
is covered with overburden material or weathered rock, exploratory drilling is done to evaluate
the depth of fresh and sound rock. Hill face exploration requires rock drilling with NX-size
diamond bits that facilitates good core recovery allowing study of the quality and quantity of
the rock available from the site for construction purpose. The drill holes should penetrate at
least 6m in the fresh rock. A contoured geological map of the selected site is prepared, and
several geological sections are drawn from drilling data that facilitate estimation of quantity of
available fresh rock and the required depth of quarrying.
The core samples obtained from drill holes are tested in the laboratory for determination
of engineering properties. Once the quality and quantity are found to fulfi l the engineering
need, the site is taken up for quarrying the required quantity of stones. The top overburden
and weathered rock are removed fi rst. In a small quarry, separation of rock chunks from rocky
surface is done by placing tools such as crowbar along divisional planes (bedding, joints, and
foliation) and then applying force using a sledge hammer. For large quantity of rocks, several
shallow holes are fi rst drilled in the rocky hill slope and then the face is blasted by controlled
blasting. Pre-splitting method is followed to obtain big rock blocks along predetermined planes.
12.9.2 Adverse Effects of Quarrying
It may be mentioned that, similar to surface mining, the quarrying to meet the demand of
construction materials such as dimension stones and crushed stones for engineering structures
such as masonry dams and rip-rap of earth dams create environmental degradation. The
exploratory work needs construction of roads to bring machineries and to carry the quarried
materials to the construction sites. Excavation including blasting of rocks in hill slopes creates
land instability and may initiate landslides. Quarrying for better rock also involves going down
similar to subsurface mining. After completion of the surface and subsurface quarrying, the
landform is left to nature, which hastens up the processes of weathering and erosion involving
landslides causing further degradation of the environment.
In quarrying construction materials, when the overburden material from the surface is
removed, it exposes the soil to weather. This further causes particles to become airborne leading
to wind erosion and may spread particles of noxious materials, that may cause diseases of the

respiratory tract in human beings. Quarrying causes physical destruction of the landscape by
creating waste rock piles and open pits and causes disturbances to wildlife and plant species.
There may be contamination of surface water passing through the waste piles of rock and
processing plants resulting in water pollution. The sediment level in streams is increased by
deposition of the transported soil from waste disposal area and by increased soil erosion from
abandoned surface pits and underground excavation.

13.1 INTRODUCTION
Grouting is a process of strengthening weak rocks and unconsolidated soil of a
project site. Grouting plays an important role in arresting the leakage of water
through fractured rocks or porous materials of a dam foundation or reservoir basin.
In a dam foundation, curtain grouting, consolidation grouting, and blanket grouting
are generally taken up to strengthen weak rocks and to contain leakage. This chapter
provides a detailed discussion on the different aspects of grouting including the
ingredients of grout and the proportion of cement, water, and other admixtures and
chemicals added for quick setting or retarding action. It describes with illustration
the equipment used in grouting and explains the factors that control grout intake
and pressure conditions. The chapter further elaborates the method of proving the
effi cacy of grouting in a site.
13.2 GEOTECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS IN GROUTING
Grouting is a method of sealing fracture openings and pore spaces in rocks and
unconsolidated deposits by injecting a mixture of water with cement and/or other
suitable substances. In Indian Standard (IS) (1356–1987), the term grouting
has been defi ned as ‘a process of injecting under pressure a slurry of fl uid grout
(cement–water mixture), or other suitable materials into the mass of a defective
rock formation through a borehole to fi ssures and cracks in the hope that all fi ssures,
joints, and cavities will be sealed off against water in rock’.
Chapter_13.indd 281 10/18/2012 5:20:33 PM
282 ● Engineering Geology
The principal purposes of grouting a soil mass or rock are the enhancement of bearing capacity
and the reduction of permeability of the mass. Grouting is widely applied in the treatment
of defective features in foundations of dams, bridges, powerhouses, and other engineering
structures that include weak rocks created by fault, shearing, jointing, and fracturing. It arrests
seepage of water through porous and fractured rocks and imparts cohesion and strength to
unconsolidated deposits to make them monolithic. Though grouting is an important tool used
for the treatment of structural sites, other measures such as providing drainage, relief well,
compaction of foundation materials, excavating slurry trenches, and concrete cut-off are also
taken up in combination with grouting to obtain optimal results.
13.2.1 Relation of Grouting to Rock Types, Rock Structures, and Overburden
The rock types and rock structures of a site of engineering structure infl uence the grouting
condition. Igneous and metamorphic rocks are commonly massive in nature, but they possess
several sets of joints and other structural defects due to faults and folds. The volume of grout
intake depends on the open spaces and interconnections of these joints and fractures. The
foliation planes and cleavage in metamorphic rocks such as schist and slate provide passageways
for the entry of suffi cient quantity of grout. The contact planes of intrusive igneous bodies
such as dykes and sills with country rocks are weak planes requiring grouting when exposed
in a structural site. Basalts sometimes contain beds of pumice, scoria, agglomerate, and tuffs
responsible for low strength and high permeability.
Sedimentary rocks such as conglomerate, sandstone, and siltstone are suffi ciently porous and
permeable and are amenable to grouting treatment. The soft sedimentary rocks such as shale
and claystone are generally impermeable, but they develop permeability when highly jointed. If
such soft and jointed rocks occur in the foundation, they need to be excavated or strengthened by
grouting. Overburden materials formed of disintegrated bedrock and deposits of alluvial, colluvial,
aeolian, and glacial origin are highly porous and permeable. Foundation grouting in combination
with other treatments (e.g., compaction and drainage) is necessary to reduce permeability and
improve stability of these deposits for the safety of the structures. Drainage under a dam represents
a row of small diameter holes (spaced at 2 m to 5 m intervals) communicating with the tail water
through a discharge device such as a pipe or drain fi lled with sandy materials.
13.2.2 Problems of Grouting Cavities
Solution of limestone, gypsum, and anhydride by surface and subsurface water creates cavities
through which there may be copious fl ow of water. The solution cavities are generally found to
develop along some structural planes. Soluble rocks affected by faults, shear zones, bedding planes,
and joints are more prone to solution effect by movement of ground water along these structural
planes. In some places, solution of limestone forms karst conditions in underground stratum.
Boreholes are drilled, followed by pump testing, to locate and assess the permeability of the soluble
rocks. In some holes, the test results may initially show low permeability due to infi lling by inert
materials such as sand and clay, but with increasing pressure the infi llings are removed when large
fl ow takes place. The treatment by grouting of cavities in a karst country is an expensive process,
but it has to be taken up in all projects that have the problem of leakage through solution cavities.
Many engineering constructions such as dam foundations, reservoirs, tunnels, and under-
ground structures face problems from groundwater. Broadly, these problems are associated
with groundwater fl ow through the open spaces in jointed rocks, open bedding planes, karstic
limestone, and faulted and sheared rocks. Observation of water table is very important to under-
stand groundwater hazards and plan grouting in subsurface rocks and overburden materials.
Chapter_13.indd 282 10/18/2012 5:20:34 PM
Treatment of Rocks and Soil by Grouting ● 283
Orientation of faults, intensity, and inclination of joints and other structural details that help
planning of grouting are obtained from outcrop mapping and logging of drill cores. Water
pumping tests are conducted to measure the permeability of rocks or soil mass of an engineer-
ing site and accordingly the grouting programme is planned. In case an artesian fl ow is detected
in a borehole, the pressure condition of the zone is to be measured so that specifi c data can be
obtained on the required high pressure for grouting this section.
13.3 DIFFERENT TYPES OF GROUTING INCLUDING THEIR PATTERNS
Strengthening of rock foundation of a dam is done generally by grout holes spaced at 3 m
to 6 m intervals later staggered by intermediate holes using varied pressures and extended
to different depths controlled by geological conditions. It is a common practice to use
shallow holes (B-holes) for foundation grouting at low pressure before placing concrete
cover. Supplementary holes (C-holes) inclined downstream for grouting from heel are used
applying high pressure after adequate foundation cover. High pressure grouting through
holes (A-holes) extended to suffi cient depths to suit the geological condition are taken up
from the gallery by vertical or inclined (70°–80°) holes after attaining suffi cient concrete
cover of foundation rock. The A-holes are drilled and grouted in a single line or multiple
lines to create a curtain to seepage path. Drainage holes are also provided from the gallery
in a row.
In addition to these three types of grout holes (A, B, and C), grouting is also undertaken to
fulfi l specifi c purposes. For example, faults or fractures are treated by high pressure grouting
through vertical or inclined holes. The holes for these high pressure grouting are drilled before
foundation cover, and pipes are kept in the holes through which grouting is taken up after
placing foundation concrete. Figure 13.1 shows the strengthening of foundation rocks by
grouting through different types of grout holes. The dotted lines indicate grout holes for treating
the fault by high pressure grouting (F–F).

13.3.1 Curtain Grouting
Curtain grouting has wide applications in the construction of dams and reservoirs. It is carried
out to cut off seepage under dams or other structures as if by providing a curtain against seepage
path. Controlling of seepage is accomplished by drilling and grouting through one or more lines
of grout holes in the foundation to specifi ed depths usually parallel to the dam axis or normal to
the direction of water movement (Fig. 13.2). This creates a barrier against seepage of water by
fi lling the voids or water passages with grout.

As regards the depth of curtain grouting, a thumb rule is to grout to a depth of two-thirds of the
hydrostatic head of the dam. Rock cores obtained from exploratory work and water percolation
tests at the site provide data regarding the depth extent of the zone of intensely fi ssured and
highly porous rocks. The percolation test data is a
24 m good guide to fi x the depth of grout curtain. In the
absence of suffi cient subsurface data, Wahlstrom

(1974) has mentioned about the closure pattern that

initial holes at fi xed intervals is complete, more holes
are drilled at intermediate positions with gradual

13.3.2 Consolidation Grouting
When a loose rock mass is consolidated by grouting, it is called
consolidation grouting. If the foundation rocks are intensely
fractured and highly permeable, consolidation grouting is carried
out covering the affected area. The bedrock at the top part is
generally open fractured and as such consolidation grouting is

these are excavated before injecting grout to make the consolidation grouting effective. In case
of extremely fractured and seamy rocks, it may be necessary to excavate the foundation to
remove them and then take up grouting. Some interconnected open joints may cause wastage of
large quantities of grout by leading the grout out of the foundation. In such cases, a single line
grouting is to be undertaken at low pressure at the fi rst instance in the periphery of foundation
to seal the leakage path.
13.3.3 Blanket or Area Grouting
The process of grouting through a specifi ed area of shallow depth for the purpose of sealing the
voids of unconsolidated material or fracture openings of rocks of a site such as a dam foundation
or reservoir surface is known as blanket or area grouting. The top few metres of the foundation or
a part of the reservoir rocks may be found defective due to high porosity and/or fracturing when
blanket grouting is undertaken only for that depth or area covered by the defective rocks. The main
purpose of blanket grouting is reducing permeability and stopping water seepage. In general, the
holes for blanket grouting are restricted to 6 m to 10 m of subsurface area from the foundation
surface or ground surface of reservoir sites (Fig. 13.5). The grout holes are directed normal to the
surface, but in special cases, where the rocks are steeply dipping, angle holes can be resorted to
for intersecting the bedding and joint planes through which seepage is expected. Blanket grouting
of a dam site is always to be taken up before the dam is constructed or the reservoir is fi lled.

generally to 10 m
13.3.4 Contact Grouting
When grouting under pressure is undertaken to seal a gap and obtain a strong contact between
an engineering structure and the foundation rock mass, it is known as contact grouting. In
this process, a neat cement grout is injected at the contact of the concrete structure and the
adjacent surface. Shrinkage of the concrete as it sets creates voids and seepage paths along the
contact. The cement grout fi lls the voids and seals the seepage paths. It is a common practice to
undertake contact grouting at the interface of a concrete dam with the abutment rock and also
in the crown of a lined tunnel to make a watertight bond between the roof area and concrete.
In contact grouting of some sites, header pipes are installed into the concrete at the place of its
contact with rock during construction, and grouting is done through the pipes after the structure
is raised. This treatment can also be done by drilling holes after the completion of construction.
13.3.5 Special-purpose Grouting
Special-purpose grouting is done to treat adverse geological conditions such as fault zones or
highly fractured zones at depths or to stabilize subsurface materials at shafts or deep structures.
Chapter_13.indd 285 10/18/2012 5:20:35 PM
286 ● Engineering Geology
The execution of special purpose grouting is done after preparing a plan and section of the
subsurface weak zone where such grouting is necessary. For example, to grout a vertical or
steeply inclined fault zone, the grout holes should be inclined, close spaced, and directed to
intersect the fault plane (Fig. 13.6). The geometry of the geological structure and the extent
of the weak feature need to be evaluated by exploratory investigation for designing special
purpose grouting. In order to seal very fi ne fi ssures in the concrete of a dam or tunnel lining,
chemical grouts are used on account of their excessive penetration property.

13.4 GROUTING EQUIPMENT AND PACKERS
Grouting equipment includes a drilling unit with a pump and air compressor to force grout into
the drill holes, generally EX to NX size (38 mm to 76 mm diameter). A tank or drum mixes
water with cement and/or other ingredients to make the grout. Two gauges, one for recording
the applied pressure and another for measuring
the quantity of grout fl ow, are attached with the
grout hole. Lightweight and compact type of
drill that can be operated by hand is suitable for
shallow holes (Fig. 13.7). This compact drill can
be used for making grout holes from adit, tunnel
shaft, and gallery.
Hard rocks with close spacing joints are
successfully grouted through EX and AX holes
using small diameter drill rods (Fig. 13.8). For

roofs, wagon drills are utilized. The wagon drill
is composed of a drill head mounted on leads that
are supported on a track-, wheel-, or skid-mounted
chassis. For underground work, generally
electric- or air-powered drilling and grouting
equipment are used. The most common type of
drilling machine used for boring and grouting
of deep holes is rotary drilling (Section 11.7).

respect to its permeability character.
Fig. 13.9 Grouting packers: (a) single packer and
(b) double packer In the other method (double packer method),
the holes are drilled up to the full depth and then
grouting is done starting from the bottom or from the top and going up or down accordingly at
fi xed intervals by attaching two packers. The two packers are so fi xed that a stretch of 3 m to
6 m barren rock remains between them through which the grout is injected so as to penetrate
the fractures of the surrounding areas (Fig. 13.9b). In the double packer method, since the
full depth of the hole is drilled before beginning the grouting operation, there are chances for
collapsing of wall rocks of the holes, especially if the rocks are soft or broken in nature.
13.5 BASIC INGREDIENTS OF GROUT AND ADMIXTURES
Grout ingredients are varied in nature. The most common grout is made up of Portland cement
mixed with water in different proportions. In fact, the dimension of the cracks or fractures in
rock determines the additional substances or admixture to be mixed with the cement–water
grout.
13.5.1 Ingredients
Grout is an aqueous suspension of solids used for injecting under pressure into the bedrock
or unconsolidated materials. Portland cement is the basic ingredient of cement grout, which
is universally used for foundation treatment of dams and other engineering structures. The
following are some specifi c types of Portland cement that are also available:
(i) Quick setting cement that has setting time one-third of normal cement
(ii) Cement that is resistant to sulphate attack
(iii) Cement of very fi ne particles that can penetrate fi ne cracks
Several admixtures in varying percentages are used with cement grout. They act as
accelerators, retarders, or fi llers. Calcium chloride is an accelerator that is mixed with cement
grout when early setting is necessary. The use of calcium chloride also prevents sulphate attack
and alkali–silica reaction. Some organic chemicals (acidic salts) are used as retarders that offset
Chapter_13.indd 287 10/18/2012 5:20:36 PM
288 ● Engineering Geology
the undesirable quickening process and prolong the injection and placement time. Sand, silt,
rock fl our, fl y ash, diatomite, pumice, barite, and other fi ne materials are used as fi llers with
cement grout to reduce cement consumption.
13.5.2 Grout Mixture
The ratio of water to cement in a grout mixture infl uences its viscosity, permeability, and setting
time. Depending upon the ratio of cement to water content by volume, the grout is termed
thin or thick. In thin grout, the water–cement ratio may be as low as 20:1, whereas in thick
grout it may be 1:1 or more. With the use of accelerator or retarder materials or chemicals, the
water–cement ratio will vary. Foundation grouting is mostly conducted with a grout mixture of
Portland cement, bentonite, and water.
A cement–bentonite–water grout also contains ingredients such as sand, clay, and pozzolan.
The presence of bentonite provides expansive (swelling) capacity in the grout when saturated
with water. Bentonite–water grout without any cement is used in grouting a reservoir periphery
to reduce the permeability of overburden and rocks with the ultimate aim of arresting leakage
from the reservoir. Silicate gel grout that contains sodium silicate and calcium chloride solution
and/or sodium carbonate solution is a quick setting grout suitable for use in packing of fi ne and
medium sands.
13.5.3 Chemical Grout and Epoxy Resin with Instances of Their Use
Chemical grouts are solutions composed of two or more types of chemicals, which after
entering into the fi ne fi ssures react to form a gel that fi lls the pores or open spaces. For example,
sodium silicate solution mixed with another chemical solution (e.g., calcium chloride) is used
as a chemical grout to convert the silicate into an insoluble gel by a catalyst dissolved in the
second chemical. The gel acts as a sealant of the fi ne voids and fi ssures. While reducing the
permeability, it helps to increase the strength rapidly. If the foundation contains silt or sand
pockets, treatment by chemical grouting is necessary for gaining rapid bondage of the loose
materials and improving the shear strength. Epoxy resin and polyester resin are used in repairing
cracks in concrete and are also employed in rock bolting.
In a part of the Obra dam in Uttar Pradesh, a sandy layer of river bed between two
concrete diaphragms was treated using chemical grout. In the sluice blocks of the Rana
Pratap Sagar project in Rajasthan, a montmorillonite seam was treated by chemical grout. In
the silty shale of the saddle dam foundation of this project, grouting was done by silicate
gel mixed with bentonite and sawdust. In the Hirakud dam in Orissa, a horizontal crack of
the vertical wall of the operational gallery had to be treated with a chemical grout to check
leakage. In the Konar dam in Bihar, under Damodar Valley Corporation, a widening crack
in the dam wall threatening leakage of reservoir water was successfully grouted by use of
epoxy resin.
13.6 GROUTING APPROACHES FOR VARIOUS ENGINEERING STRUCTURES
Test grouting is necessary to design the plan of grouting in a project site including its cost
estimation. The following points are given due consideration while planning to undertake test
grouting:
(i) Where different types of rocks are present, test grouting should be done for each type of
rock.
Chapter_13.indd 288 10/18/2012 5:20:37 PM
Treatment of Rocks and Soil by Grouting ● 289
(ii) Different types of grout mixtures are to be used in test grouting so that the mixture giving
the best result can be applied during the actual operation.
(iii) Permeability test and core drilling are to be conducted before and after the tests to ascertain
the effectiveness of grouting.
13.6.1 Grouting of Concrete Dam Foundation
Both consolidation and curtain grouting are undertaken in the foundation of concrete dams
comprising porous or fractured rocks (Fig. 13.10). Consolidation grouting is taken up when
the foundation grade is attained after excavation and
the foundation area is cleaned properly. A single line
of curtain grouting at the upstream end of the dam is
generally satisfactory in a concrete dam as it is founded
on competent rocks. In case the foundation rock is of
lower strength or contains erratic joints, multiple lines

of grouting are undertaken. The distance between two
adjacent lines will be 2 m or slightly less. Initially,
the grout holes in each line are spaced at 3 m to 6 m

foundation, curtain grouting, and drainage
The holes for grout curtain are drilled from the gallery
holes taken up from gallery
when drainage holes are also drilled. Grouting of the
dam should always be completed before fi lling the reservoir so as to avoid additional pressure
and seepage possibility with the rise of water level.
13.6.2 Grouting in Earth and Rock-fi ll Dams
In earth or rock-fi ll dams, curtain grouting is taken up before beginning the dam construction.
Low pressure (gravity pressure) is used for the upper zone avoiding any erosion of the dam
foundation. If any sensitive material such as swelling clay is present in the fi ll material, it is
better to remove this material and execute the grouting before the fi nal foundation preparation.
The grout holes are drilled from a concrete fi lling of a shallow trench (grout cap) in parts of the
foundation. If the grouting is carried out from a grout cap at the upstream end (heel of the dam),
this may be done after the completion of the dam.
13.6.3 Grout Curtain with Drainage Holes
The grout curtains in dams must be supplemented by drainage arrangement. In spite of thorough
grouting, some small percentage of fi ssures may remain in the grouted rock that may act as
seepage path under reservoir conditions. In gravity dams, grouting is possible from the inspection
gallery by drilling new holes or through the drainage holes. However, in case of earth dams and
rock-fi ll dams, it is diffi cult to undertake such grouting after the construction of the dam, and
hence, preventive measures against possible seepage from these dam foundations are taken up
by means of blanket or curtain grouting prior to dam construction. It is a common practice to
Chapter_13.indd 289 10/18/2012 5:20:37 PM
290 ● Engineering Geology
excavate wells or construct drainage prisms downstream of the
grout curtain to intercept the seepage water into the hole and
thus reduce the built-up pressure (Fig. 13.11).
13.6.4 Reservoir Rim Grouting
Gallery
Grouting of reservoir rim is taken up if there is a chance of
seepage of stored water to another valley. This may happen
in case a constricted land separates the reservoir from a lower
valley. Presence of porous conglomerate bed, limestone
or other soluble rocks, and structures such as faults in the
reservoir area may cause substantial leakage. Investigations
carried out to fi nd the water tightness of a reservoir include
Drainage Relief
Cut-off
hole well geological mapping, exploratory drilling, and tracer study.
Fig. 13.11 Grouting of foundation In order to control leakage, generally a single line of curtain
extending cut-off, drainage, and relief grouting is taken up along the reservoir rim. The exact extent
wells until the end of porous beds and depth of curtain are decided from the geological condition
of the reservoir rocks. Test grouting is fi rst carried out for designing and estimating the
grout pattern. Grouting is completed before fi lling the reservoir as the rise in water level
may aggravate the leakage problem and create diffi culty in grouting operation. Reservoir
projects in karstic limestone in different parts of the world including the Obra dam of India
have undergone very extensive and expensive grouting to arrest leakage of reservoir water
(Section 22.7).
13.6.5 Grouting in Tunnels and Underground Chambers
Grouting in tunnels and underground chambers is done to consolidate the wall rocks and prevent
seepage of water. In tunnels, pressure grouting is usually done by cement grout. The grout holes
are directed so as to penetrate maximum number of joints and fracture planes in rocks of the
underground structures. As the structural planes are visible in underground construction, it is
easy to orient the grout hole for effective grouting of defective rocks. The grout holes in tunnels
are drilled in a ring pattern starting from the invert level and proceeding upwards to cover the
crown. The length and spacing of the holes depend on the rock condition and may be 6 m to 9 m
deep and spaced at 3 m to 6 m intervals. After a lining is provided to the tunnel or underground
chamber, contact grouting is necessary to seal the gaps between the grouted rocks and the
concrete or steel linings.
13.7 GROUTING PLAN AND PATTERN WITH INDIAN EXAMPLES
The locations of the grout holes including depth of penetration are decided from the
geological condition of the site. In hard rocks, 38 mm to 76 mm (EX to NX) size holes are
good enough, but in soft rocks, larger diameter holes are chosen for effective grouting. Large
diameter holes are drilled when there is a chance of caving of walls. The spacing is decided
from the characteristics and frequency of the fractures in rocks. Primarily, the grout holes are
spaced at 3 m intervals, but if grout intake is unabated, intermediate holes spaced at 1.5 m
intervals are taken up. The close-spaced holes allow penetration of the grout covering more
subsurface areas and thus help nearly complete sealing of the voids of porous materials or
rock strata. The depth of the curtain should be suffi cient to minimize seepage and reduce uplift
pressure.

13.7.1 Geological Approach in Preparing Plan for Grouting
The geological approach of making a plan for foundation grouting will be to prepare large
scale maps (scale 1:100 or larger) for foundation blocks, plotting details of structural elements
including attitudes of the joints, fractures, shear zones, and so forth. With the help of this
map and due consideration of water percolation test data, the plan for foundation grouting is
prepared. Whether grouting should be undertaken before or after concreting depends on the
nature of the rock types and may be decided after grouting a test hole. It is better to complete the
grouting prior to concreting when all structural features are visible; however, if there is a chance
of upheaval, grouting is to be carried out after one or two metres of concreting or masonry work
to prevent the heaving effect.
13.7.2 Geological Considerations in Planning of Foundation Grouting
Based on the geological conditions, a broad programme on grouting operation is prepared
during the planning or design stage of project investigation. Initially grout holes are spaced
3 m to 6 m intervals (Depending on the grout intake in these holes, intermediate holes at the
mid-point of the two holes are then drilled and the entire foundation area grouted. The depths
of grout holes for dam foundation are deduced from dam height and rock condition at depth,
generally restricted within 15 m. If the rock is soft, consolidation grouting is to be planned up
to the depth at which fi rm bedrock is available. The pressure applied for consolidation grouting
in sound rocks starts from an initial low 2 kg/cm2 and then it may be raised progressively up to
10 kg/cm2. However, in very soft rock, the grout intake may be by gravity fl ow or by applying
pressure limited to 1 kg/cm2 as in the Siwalik sand-rocks of Beas dam site.
The structural set-up of the rock is the prime
factor that controls the grout intake. Unless the
foundation rock is homogeneous in nature, the
uniform pattern as in the grid may not produce
the desired result. Study of rock cores obtained
from exploratory drill holes with respect to
spacing, dip, and depth of joints helps in planning
of grouting pattern for dam foundations (Fig.
13.12). For example, in rocks with vertical joints,
only oblique holes can intersect a good number
of joints and ensure the fl ow of grout. A similar
situation was found in the Umiam dam foundation
Fig. 13.12 Joints and other divisional planes in drill
of Meghalaya where the dip of joints in foundation
cores of subsurface rocks
rocks, quartzite and phyllite, is vertical. A grid
pattern of grouting with vertical holes as per engineering design did not show any signifi cant
grout intake in foundation rocks. A plan was then made for grouting on geological consideration
suggesting angle holes and fi xing specifi c locations of the holes including directions and depths
to penetrate for each grout hole. The plan produced high grout intake ensuring consolidation and
enhanced strength of the foundation rocks [Appendix A.1 C(2)].

are drilled in single, double, or triple rows and spaced 3 m to 6 m apart. The depths of the
holes are kept at 30 per cent to 70 per cent of the head under full reservoir level (FRL) and
maximum pressure used is generally 1.5 to 2 times the hydraulic head. For example, in the
226 m high Bhakra dam of Punjab (Section 21.6) the depth of the grout curtain provided
and the maximum pressure used are 40 per cent (90 m deep) and twice the hydraulic head,
respectively, whereas the depth of the curtain was kept at 67 per cent and grouting pressure
adopted was 1.5 times the hydraulic pressure in the Rana Pratap Sagar dam of Rajasthan
[see Appendix A.1 B(1)].
13.8 EFFECTIVE PRESSURE AND ROCK MASS PERMEABILITY
The application of correct pressure for grouting operation requires knowledge of strength
properties of rocks or materials to be grouted and good judgement about the effect of pressure
on them. In consolidation grouting to shallow depth, pressures are generally applied depending
upon the nature of rock condition and structural set-up so that the foundation rock does not get
fractured. Application of high pressure is necessary in curtain grouting extended to deep parts
in hard rock so that more grout can enter into the rock fi ssures.
Under full storage condition, the pressure due to the head of reservoir may cause seepage
of water by removing the clay fi lling. As such, the suggested grouting pressure should not be
arbitrary. In general, it should be 1.5 to 2 times the designed hydraulic head but not less than the
head. In the foundation of the Aliyar dam of Tamil Nadu consisting of hard but highly jointed
rock (granite gneiss), the applied pressure was less than the hydraulic head. It created seepage
trouble in the post-construction stage.
At the entry point of grout into fi ssures, it maintains the same pressure as applied, indicated
by a pressure gauge. As the grout tends to penetrate the fi ssure openings, it exerts pressure
to cause upheaval of the rock above fl at plane of fi ssure. If the rock is soft in nature, there is
a chance of further opening of the fi ssure plane. The friction along the open fi ssure reduces
the fl uid pressure. The reduction in pressure is also a function of the distance of travel of the
grout. The more the distance covered, the less will be the effective pressure. At every point
of the grout fl ow, the overburden pressure counteracts to stop upheaval due to the applied
pressure. It is important to note that if long and fl at fi ssure plane is cut across by the grout
hole, application of very low pressure should be considered. A common feature of cutting
an open plane of fi ssure is the fall of gauge pressure and large quantity of fl ow of grout. In
such a case, the pressure is to be reduced to such an extent that the fl ow rate remains the
same.
It is emphasized that the success of grouting regarding intake of suffi cient quantity of grout
depends upon the effective grouting programme with respect to rock attitudes. Some rocks
with very low permeability may not take grout at all. Thus, prior estimation of permeability
is an indicator of possible grout intake of the rock. In soft rocks, grouting is always done
under low pressure. Shale is porous but not permeable and it is a natural barrier against
leakage of water. Use of high pressure produces fi ssure in soft impermeable rocks such as
shale. In Kopili project, Meghalaya, there was a high intake of grout in impervious shale and
not the underlying limestone bed which was cavernous and fractured. This unusual situation
is caused due to grouting under high pressure that caused fracturing of shale and thus
more grout intake. In hard and fractured rocks, the frequency and apertures of fractures
are the principal avenues for grout intake. The permeability of such rocks is dependent on
Chapter_13.indd 293 10/18/2012 5:20:38 PM
294 ● Engineering Geology
fracture apertures. The cement–water grout (having cement particles of size about 100 microns)
cannot penetrate if the pore or fi ssure spaces are less than 100 microns. Observation has revealed
that a fractured rock starts with thin cement grout, but takes thicker grouts with increasing
permeability imposed by the use of progressively higher pressures. In other words, there is
more cement penetration with increasing permeability. The Lugeon values of pre-grouting
permeability tests bear the relation shown in Table 13.2 with the proportion of cement in
water–cement grout as advocated by Houlsby (Attewell and Farmer 1976) from a rule of thumb
decision.
Table 13.2 Relation between permeability and water–cement
ratio
Permeability (Lugeons) Water–cement ratio
10 3:1
10–30 2:1
30–60 1:1
60 0.8:1
There is, however, no strict correlation as to the grout intake and the effective pressure.
During pressure grouting in hard rock by application of increasing pressures, the apertures are
enlarged to some extent allowing more intake of grout.
13.9 TREATMENT OF CAVITY BY GROUTING
In an engineering project, cavities may occur below the dam foundation or in the reservoir
area. These are generally formed in limestone by solution effect or in conglomerate created
by removal of loose bonding of cementing materials. Some old quarries or mines also
create cavities by collapsing. It is very diffi cult to grout properly under such situation as it
is covered by thick overburden (collapsed) materials. Hidden below alluvium or located in
soluble rocks, identifi cation of cavities and their fi lling is a challenging job. An open joint
or voids in rock can be successfully grouted using cement grout, but if there is a cavity fi lled
with clay, grouting may not be effective. In addition, a single hole may be unable to trace the
cavity. A detailed exploratory work is necessary to locate the cavity and prove its dimension
before grouting is undertaken. Usually, geophysical search, tracer study, and drilling with
water permeability tests provide clues to the presence of subsurface cavities and solution
channels.
The treatment of cavities depends on the dimensions. If the cavities are of considerable size,
they are fi rst packed in by ordinary fi ll material. A sand mixture is usually used with cement
grout to seal the cavity. Intermittent grouting, which is a process of grouting at intervals of
several hours, is used in grouting of cavities. Before the cavity fi lling operation is taken up, the
maximum amount of grout to be injected should be predetermined based on the knowledge of
the cavity dimensions indicated from exploratory data. The cavities are fi rst grouted or packed
by sand mixture (the ratio of sand to cement being 2:1 or thicker), the sand being the fi ller.
They are then grouted by cement–bentonite mixture. Bentonite in the grout mix reduces the
permeability of the rock and thereby contains or reduces seepage. The grout should be rather
thick so that it can seal cavities and provide bondage to varied size grains in the rock. If the
Chapter_13.indd 294 10/18/2012 5:20:38 PM
Treatment of Rocks and Soil by Grouting ● 295
cavity is big, the thick grout can fi ll it to stabilize and strengthen the rock. Refusal of grout
intake suggests that grout fi lling has been effective.
13.10 EFFICACY OF GROUTING
The following four factors are considered to examine the effi cacy of grouting:
(i) Location and direction of the grout holes
(ii) Depth of penetration
(iii) Applied pressure
(iv) Control of grout consistency
The geological set-up of the area determines the locations where grouting operation is to
be taken up. The exploratory work done at the planning stage helps to reveal the subsurface
geology, and accordingly, the nature of grouting required and the depth to which grouting is to
be extended are planned. Vertical grout holes are always preferred for ease of drilling and grout
injection. These holes are, however, effective only where the rock strata are of uniform nature
and structural planes including bedding are nearly horizontal. If the area for grouting consists
of vertical or steeply dipping bedded rock or weak zones, the grout holes are to be inclined
and so oriented that they intersect nearly normal to the bedding or foliation plane or the weak
zones. The pressure to be applied should be such that it does not damage the rock condition.
In practice, initially low pressure is applied and thin grout is used but gradually the pressure is
increased and thicker grout used. However, thick grout should be used from the beginning if
the subsurface region consists of large openings in structurally weak rocks or those created by
solution effect.
The dimension of open spaces in rocks determines the grout consumption or effi cacy of
grouting. In the case of use of cement slurry as grout in fi nely fi ssured rock, the size of the
cement particles should be less than the openings of the rocks for their settlement into the
gaps or openings. Openings greater than the capillary size permit free fl ow of grout water,
but obstruct the entrance of solid suspensions of the grout. It is also necessary to see that
the openings are interconnected to allow fl ow of the grout under pressure. In the case
of the presence of suffi ciently open spaces, the cement slurry can travel a fair distance
through them and becomes effective in sealing the open spaces. It may also be remembered
that excessive grout intake through a hole may sometimes create a false impression.
The grout may pass on to a different place travelling a long distance through crevices in
the rock.
After the grouting work is completed at a site, the effi cacy of grouting is determined through
some test holes drilled for rock coring and later conducting permeability test through them.
Appearance of stringers or threads of cement in the cores is indicative of the penetration of
grout. A comparison of the pre-grouting and post-grouting permeability test results help to
ascertain the effi cacy of grouting. The relatively low water loss in post-grouting permeability
test indicates that grouting has been done effectively. In the Kadana dam in Gujarat consisting of
quartzite, curtain grouting was undertaken starting with very thin grout and gradually going to
thicker grout with cement–water ratio from 1: 20 to 1:1 using pressures progressively increasing
from 3.5 kg/cm2 to 7.0 kg/cm2 (Table 13.1). The water permeability tests in the pre-grouting
and post-grouting operations showed reduction in average permeability from 10 Lugeons to
3.5 Lugeons, confi rming the effectiveness of grouting.

14.1 INTRODUCTION
This chapter deals with the different aspects of dam construction, their utilities and
functions, and the investigation approach during site selection and construction
stages as well as during post-construction stage in some cases. It provides an
elaborate description on the sources of construction materials and selection process
of a dam site, which involves the study of the project area with aerial photography,
remote sensing, and geological mapping. The chapter also explains the methods of
geophysical and drilling exploration of the site for evaluation of subsurface data,
especially to meet design. It further highlights the adverse effects of faults, joints,
and other weak geological features in a dam foundation and suggests their remedial
measures. In addition, it elaborates the causative factors of dam failures with examples.
14.2 TERMINOLOGY AND BASIC ASPECTS OF DAM CONSTRUCTION
A dam is a water-retention structure suitably built across a river valley to block the
fl ow of river water and form an artifi cial lake in its upstream part called reservoir.
Construction of a dam covers the river valley or channel section and parts of the
two sides of the valley called abutments. To the engineers, abutments are the parts
of the dam that rest on side slopes. The top of the dam is known as its crest and the
difference in levels between the top reservoir surf ace and the crest measures the
freeboard of the dam. The upstream end of the dam where it meets the foundation
is the heel and the downstream part of its contact with base is the toe of the dam.

from backwater effect and discharge through a
spillway or conduit outlet is called tailwater.

Tailwater the dam with respect to its height, the greater will be the
Gallery pressure from reservoir water. The gravitational force of a
dam depends on the density of the dam body. In addition, the
Heel Toe force generated by an earthquake acts adversely on a dam.
Fig. 14.2 Cross section of a concrete Seeping of water through the foundation causes up-thrust or
gravity dam illustrating different parts
uplift at the base or from the dam body itself. In fact, many
types of forces act on the dam such as water thrust, uplift, load of sediment deposit, dead weight
of dam, wind pressure, and seismic force. These forces concentrate at the dam foundation and
affect the stability of the structure. The overall result is the development of deformation (strain)
in dam foundation and possible displacement (shear) of the structure. The dam is so designed
that it possesses suffi cient strength to withstand all the forces acting on it.
The forces to be resisted by a gravity dam fall into two categories. First, forces such as
weight of the dam and water pressure are calculated from the specifi c gravities or densities
of the materials and properties of pore pressure. Second, forces such as earthquakes, silt, and
load can be predicted on the basis of assumptions of varying reliabilities. For consideration
of stability, it is assumed that the dam is composed of individual transverse vertical elements
each of which carries its load to the foundation without transfer of load from or to its adjacent
elements and the vertical stress varies linearly. The uplift pressure distribution in the body of
the dam is assumed to be equal to water head at the upstream face and zero at the downstream
face. It is also assumed that earthquakes have no effect on uplift forces.
For ensuring the stability of the structure, the principal design approach is such that the
foundation must have enough strength or load-bearing capacity to resist the hydrodynamic
and seepage forces. The vertical force (the load of the dam) must be high enough to avoid the
adverse effects of the horizontal (shear) force. The denser the material of the dam, the more will
be the capacity to shear resistance. The limiting factor for a concrete dam is that large cracks

should not appear in concrete (which is not necessarily dependent on concrete technology) due
to overloading, irregular settlement, and so forth. These are the basic principles of design for the
safety of the structure. In practice, however, several factors are considered in the design of a dam.
14.2.2 Utilities of Dams
Harnessing the water resources of a country is the main aim of constructing a dam. A dam
is the most essential infrastructure for water resource management. Dams ensure adequate
water supply by storing it during the time of surplus and supplying it in the days of scarcity.
Construction of a dam ensures availability of water in the reservoir throughout the year, which
serves the following purposes:
(i) The stored water is supplied to the farmers for irrigation of lands even in dry period. An
unfertile land or arid region is irrigated to produce crops by diverting the reservoir water
by a system of canals.
(ii) City and town people are supplied water from the reservoir for drinking and domestic use.
The supply remains uninterrupted even during the summer months when there is scarcity
of water.
(iii) The artifi cial lake created by damming of the river is used as a centre of recreation such as
for boating and fi shing activities. It facilitates growth of tourism and helps navigation.
(iv) Water is needed in industrial units associated with various production works. The demand
for water in industries is mostly met by water from the reservoir.
(vi) Many of the dams with large reservoir capacity release water for generation of hydroelectric
power. People in both rural and urban areas and many industries benefi t from the power
generated.
(v) Heavy rains in the upstream parts of many rivers cause fl ooding of downstream areas.
Building of dam stores the excess water in the reservoir and thus controls fl oods.
In spite of plenty of water in the innumerable river systems of India, the country suffers from
draught or fl oods in some place or the other. About 80 per cent of the annual rainfall of India occurs
during the monsoon months when the water can be utilized from the run of the river. However,
the rainfall is not evenly distributed, resulting in fl oods in some parts and drought in some other
parts of the country. Hence, if the water is stored in reservoirs by building dams, this will reduce
fl ood havoc and serve the need of water for drinking, irrigation, power generation, and industry
throughout the year. Several dams in India are built to serve such multiple purposes, though fl ood
control is the primary purpose of many of them. The Damodar Valley Scheme is the fi rst multi-
purpose river valley project in India that mitigates the fl oods of the river Damodar, irrigates vast
areas of Jharkhand and West Bengal, and generates electricity for use by these two states.
14.3 TYPES OF DAMS AND THEIR FUNCTIONS
Dams are broadly classifi ed into the following four groups on the basis of the types of material
used in their construction:
(i) Concrete dam

14.3.1 Concrete Dams
Depending on their bearing strength and stability, concrete dams are subdivided into three
categories, namely gravity, arch, and buttress dams.
Gravity dams have straight or slightly curved axes and are generally triangular or trapezoidal
in cross section with bed widths about two-thirds their heights. The downstream face of these
dams can be straight or curved. The thick concrete body of a gravity dam provides the necessary
weight to withstand the forces due to water thrust and uplift pressure. A narrow valley with
sound rock is the ideal place for constructing a concrete gravity dam (Figs 14.1 and 14.3), but
it can be successfully built in soft sedimentary strata also after strengthening the foundation.
The 225.5 m-high Bhakra dam in Punjab, which
is one of the highest concrete gravity dams in the
world, has been built on shale–sandstone rocks
of Siwalik formation (Fig. 14.4). Figure 14.3
shows a concrete gravity dam under construction
across the river Umiam in Meghalaya having
hard quartzite and arenaceous phyllite in the
abutments and base.
Arch dams are arched or curved in their
confi guration and hence the name. The 169m-
high Idukki dam in Kerala constructed on massive
granite gneiss of a canyon site is an example of
large arch gravity dam (Fig. 14.5). In fact, arch

side facing headwater, see Fig. 14.6 (a). In cross
section (vertical section), these dams are relatively
thin and curved in shape Fig. 14.6 (b). In an arch
dam, a part of the thrust due to reservoir water is
distributed to the abutment rock by the arch action.
The thickness and curvature of the body of an arch
dam are so designed that more than half of the
acting load is transferred to the abutment. As such,
the abutment and foundation rocks should have
suffi cient strength to bear the load. In case more
than half the dam load is kept on the foundation, it
is to be called an arched gravity dam. Arch dams
are generally constructed in narrow valleys or
Fig. 14.5 Idukki arch gravity dam in Kerala canyons such that the heights are generally more
than the axial lengths, see Fig. 14.6 (c).
Buttress dams are massive, thin, or arched slabs supported by vertical walls or buttresses.
The slabs having upstream slopes bear the water thrust while the buttresses acting normal to
the planes of the slabs take the load of the headwater and transfer it to the foundation. Steep
beams or girders spaced between the buttresses prevent their bending. The structural parts of
the buttress dams are made of concrete or reinforced concrete. Depending upon the shape, the
buttress dams may be of fl at slab type as shown in Figs 14.7 (a) and (c) or arch type shown in
Figs 14.7 (b) and (d). Buttress dams require fi rm rock in the river bed where they buttress. The
interior part being hollow, these dams consume less concrete than other types of dams; hence,
their construction cost is comparatively less.

Masonry dams (Fig. 14.8) are made of big undressed
Face of spillway blocks of rocks including river boulders bound together
by concrete. The rocks selected for construction of
Stone masonry dams are non-porous and the binding among
blocks the rock fragments or boulders creates a watertight body.
As such, the entire body of the masonry dam acts as an
Dissipator
impermeable barrier against leakage of reservoir water.
Only the cemented joint portions among the blocks must

are stone masonry structures. The 139 m-high Srisailam

14.3.3 Rock-fi ll Dams
Rock-fi ll dams are made up of an admixture of ground spoils, river deposits (e.g., gravels,
pebbles, and boulders), and crushed rocks. They are trapezoidal in cross section with side slope
commonly in excess of 1:1.
Depending upon the nature of impermeable membrane provided in the rock-fi ll dams, they
are grouped into the following two types:
(i) Dams with concrete wall in the upstream face, which creates the impermeable barrier
against leakage (Fig. 14.9)

(ii) Dams with impervious earth or clay (core) in the central part, which acts as the impermeable
membrane
Except the upstream impermeable concrete wall or the impermeable clay core, the remaining
parts of a rock-fi ll dam remain permeable even after compression. In the past two decades,
construction of rock-fi ll dams has become popular as large dams of this type can be built at a
lower cost than the concrete dams. Rock-fi ll dam is specially constructed in high seismic zones.
The 116m-high Salal dam in Jammu and Kashmir—see Fig. 14.10, showing the removal of
loose river deposits by power shovel during foundation preparation—is an example of a rock-
fi ll dam in a high seismic zone.

14.3.4 Earth Dams
Earth dams are trapezoidal in cross section with
gentle side slopes (Fig. 14.11). An earth dam is
generally constructed in a broad valley where it
is very expensive to build a concrete or masonry
structure. The earth dam also does not require
rocky foundation and it can be founded on fi rm
soil. However, availability of adequate quantity
of homogeneous earth of both pervious and semi-
pervious types is to be assured for constructing
an earth dam.

Depending upon the material and competence
of the foundation, the slopes provided in earth
dams commonly vary from 1:1.5 to 1:3 (vertical:
horizontal). The material excavated from the
borrow pits is hauled to the dam site by earth
movers and compressed into graded layers
as per design (Fig. 14.12). To attain complete
water tightness, a clay core that acts as the
impermeable membrane is provided. Most dams
in India are earth dams. Earth of suitable quality
Fig. 14.12 An earth dam immediately after is available in plenty in most parts of India. The
compaction of earth and stone pitching cost of construction of an earth dam including
quarrying, placement, and compression is the least. A dam made of earth and fi ll material is
known as an embankment dam.
14.3.5 Different Types of Dams, Barrages, and Weirs
A dam is called a composite dam if a part of it is made of earth or rock-fi ll and the other parts
are built of concrete or masonry works. In a composite dam, the spillway is constructed in the
concrete or masonry dam portion. The 4600 m-long Hirakud dam of Orissa is a composite type
dam composed of earth for a stretch of 3650 m and the rest is of concrete and masonry construction.
Chapter_14.indd 305 10/27/2012 12:50:53 PM
306 ● Engineering Geology
A dam constructed of excavated natural materials or industrial wastes is an embankment
dam. If more than 50 per cent of the total volume of an embankment dam is made of compacted
fi ne-grained materials obtained from borrow areas, it is known as earth-fi lled or earth dam.
In fact, an embankment dam is a massive water barrier having a semi-permanent water proof
natural covering for its surface and a dense waterproof core.
A tailing dam is a special type of dam (concrete or earth fi lled) that retains the tailing slurry
of mine waste in the pond created by the dam. Tailings are the materials leftover after the
process of separating the valuable fraction from the worthless fraction after mining of an ore.
Water is spilled through the spillway of a tailing dam in a conventional way.
Burning of coal in coal-based power plants produces a huge stock pile of fl y ash, which is
disposed in a pond that forms a huge deposit of ash pond. The wet disposal of fl y ash involves
constructing a large pond and fi lling it with the ash slurry. Around the ash pond, an artifi cial
barrier is created in the form of an embankment dam and the structure is known as fl y ash pond
dam or simply ash pond dam. It is a zoned construction with clay core. There are many such
dams in the US for which safety rules have been enacted so that the material does not cause any
hazards by mixing with the stream in the lower parts. Design of such dam specially takes care
of stability of structure and control of seepage of fl y ash materials.
A barrage is a barrier like a dam built across a river, but it has no fi xed reservoir. The barrage
diverts a part of the river through a network of canals especially to facilitate irrigation of land of
surrounding areas. The Farakka barrage across the Ganges in West Bengal is an example. This
barrage diverts water from the Ganges to the river Hooghly through feeder canals.
A weir is a small overfl ow type of dam that causes a complete closure of the stream channel.
It creates a barrier across a river creating a pool of water behind the structure but allows water to
fl ow over the top (Fig. 14.13). In its simplest form, a weir consists of a bulkhead of timber, metal,
or concrete with an opening of fi xed dimension generally cut like a V-notch at the top edge. A
weir is commonly constructed to alter the fl ow regime of the river with a view to prevent fl ood and
help navigation. It also allows measurement of water discharge of small- and medium-size rivers.

14.4 SPILLWAYS AND GATES
Spillways that discharge water from upstream to downstream part are the most essential
structures required for proper functioning of dams (Fig. 14.14). It is a means of releasing
fl oodwater without causing any damage to the dam. The spillway may be an integral part of the
dam constructed at the centre or at the side of the dam axis. In some dam projects, especially in
earth dams, the spillway is located in a separate place outside the body of the dam.
A spillway has three parts. The head structure functions as the water inlet being provided with
guide walls and bulkhead, the discharge structure carries the fl ow from its upper reaches to lower
parts, and the terminal structure acts as an outlet or discharge to the tailwater. The spillway can

be free fl owing or it may be under controlled fl ow
by a gated structure. The fi ve major types of spill-
ways are described in the following subsections.
14.4.1 Normal Spillway
Figure 14.14 shows a normal spillway. It is a
concrete structure in the form of a channel at the
upper part followed by a steep chute. The chute
is rectangular or trapezoidal in shape (cross
section) with training walls through which the
reservoir water fl ows to the downstream valley
Fig. 14.14 Spillway with chute and discharge of (Fig. 14.15). In a normal spillway, the fl ow of
water to the downstream part of North Koel concrete
water is generally regulated by a gate at the crest

of the dam.

dam body. The pipe is laid for some lengths of the dam in a dig and cover manner for the low
headwater projects.

14.4.3 Tunnel Spillway

and the lower end (almost horizontal) discharges the water. It is provided with a gate chamber
for free fl ow or fl ow under pressure.

14.4.5 Side Channel Spillway
The side channel spillway structure (Fig. 14.19) is located towards the left or right abutment
of the dam. The upper and lower portions of the channel are joined by a chute for regular fl ow
of water from the reservoir to meet the main river at the downstream part. The portion of the
chute consists of an access channel, a head structure in the form of a trough. The head structure
is a weir generally broad crested. In an ungated chute, the weir structure is designed with a
curvilinear crest to ensure specifi ed discharge.

Dams and Spillways ● 309
A spillway structure terminates in a stilling basin where the intensity of the discharge is reduced
by means of a design device. The end of the spillway may be in a ledge to provide overfl ow
condition or a cantilever extension. In a concrete dam, the end device may be a ski jump that
projects the jet at some distance away from the toe of the dam. The spillway of a dam is constructed
in a separate place when the dam body does not possess suffi cient space for the discharge or if the
downstream bedrock is of soft nature threatening deep scouring at the toe of the dam.
In an earth dam of high headwater fl ow, it is not possible to construct a concrete structure
such as a spillway on the body of the dam for the safety of the structure. A separate spillway is
then constructed for the earth dam at a place having a favourable topography and sound rock
suitable for founding a concrete structure. For a small earth dam with low water head, however,
a conduit or pipe type spillway can be made through the body of the dam. The prime criterion
in the design of a spillway is that it should safely discharge the fl oodwater of the river without
any damage to the dam. Inadequate spillway capacity may cause abnormal rise in the upstream
fl oodwater level leading to overtopping of the non-overfl ow section and damage to the structure.
14.4.6 Outlet Works
A portion of the reservoir water may be diverted through a tunnel or conduit for the purpose of
supply to irrigation canals, water supply schemes, or hydroelectric plants for power generation.
This water diversion structure is termed the outlet. The outlet may be in the form of a tunnel
through the abutments to carry water for the distribution system or it may be a conduit made
of pipes through the body of the dam (Fig. 14.1). The water enters through the conduit inlets
located at the submerged top or bottom orifi ces at the reservoir end installed with service gates
and discharged to the downstream parts (Fig. 14.20). The concrete dam of Bhakra has such
a conduit type of outlet for distribution of water to irrigation canals to various users in the
downstream areas (Fig. 14.4).

14.4.7 Gates of Different Types and Their Functions
Gate
Gates are mobile structures that facilitate closing or
opening passes for water to fl ow down. They can be opened
completely or partially to allow controlled discharge. A
controlled type spillway is provided with gates in the dam
crest, which carries pressures to the piers and abutments,
see Fig. 14.21(a). The gates attached to the spillways are
mainly of two types, namely plain gate and radial gate.
(a) (b)
They may be automatic or manual. In the automatic type,

and (b) plain gate rises to a certain level.

Plain gates These are commonly known as planks and work by translation movement along
slots in piers across the spillway crest. It may be of lift or slide type, as shown in Fig. 14.21(b).
Radial gates These operate by rotary turning on hinges, see Fig. 14.22.
In addition to these service types of gates, an emergency gate is also provided for use if the
service gate fails. A spillway may also be of uncontrolled type without any gate. In such cases,
high discharge may harm the dam crest or scour the downstream parts. (Fig. 14.22)

14.5 INFLUENCE OF GEOMORPHOLOGY AND GEOLOGY IN THE DESIGN OF A DAM
A dam is designed following the accepted safety norms and keeping the costs as minimal as
possible. Confi guration of the river valley at the dam site, nature of foundation rocks or materials,
depth to bedrock, and availability of construction materials are essential considerations in the
design of the type of a dam. A wide and shallow river section is suitable for an embankment
dam. A deep and narrow valley is ideal for a concrete dam having a chord-to-height ratio of 2:1
or 3:1. In the rock-fi ll or earth dams, the valley
walls in both upstream and downstream sides
will be of gentle slope, generally less than 1:1.
Precise geological evaluation including
identifi cation of the adverse geological features
of the dam site is necessary to help the engineer
design suitable type of the dam after adopting
measures to rectify the defects of the dam
foundation. The following points are important
when designing a dam:
(i) The foundation must be very stable so that
it does not cause any settlement. Massive
rocks free from faults, shear zones, joints,
weathering, and decomposition available
at the river bed or at a shallow depth are
favourable for the foundation of a concrete
Fig. 14.23 A dam site on the North Koel river
dam. Figure 14.23 shows a dam site on
comprising fresh and massive granite gneiss before
construction of a high concrete dam the river North Koel in Bihar comprising

Dams and Spillways ● 311
fresh and massive granite gneiss before construction of a high concrete dam and
Fig. 14.24 shows the constructed concrete dam.
Fig. 14.24 Constructed concrete dam at the site on the river
(ii) If the site consists of a thick mantle of overburden at the river bed or at the abutments, the
site is not considered suitable for a concrete or masonry dam as the fi rm bedrock is available
at a very deep level. If the overburden material of a dam site is the in situ disintegrated
product of igneous or metamorphic rocks and the deposit is impervious in nature, an earth
dam may be constructed over the deposit after excavating the loose river deposit.
(iii) It is, however, necessary to conduct in-situ strength and permeability test of the deposit
for designing the suitable structure. Similarly, if the dam site rock is weathered or
decomposed to a great extent, the site is generally not considered for construction of
concrete or masonry dam. It is necessary to carry out exploratory work at the site to fi nd
the depth of fresh rock for the purpose of economic design of the dam. Whether a dam site
has any buried channel below the proposed foundation is also to be explored as this may
result in leakage under reservoir condition.
(iv) The nature and disposition of the layered rock of a dam site should be known for planning
and designing a structure. Soft rock is not suitable at the foundation of a high dam,
especially for concrete and masonry types. Shale and sandstone occurring as alternate
beds with low downstream dip may bring distress or failure of a dam. Such site requires
appropriate protective measures in the design of the dam against slide of the structure.
(v) Unfavourable geological structures such as joints and shear zones are commonly found in
all types of foundation rocks. Fault or large zones of crushing present in the foundation
will create problems in construction of a dam. If weak structures such as faults, thrusts,
shear zones, and joints are present in a dam site rock, they need to be precisely evaluated
for adopting corrective measures in the design of the dam.
(vi) When a sound bedrock occurs in the dam site, either exposed on the river bed or below
the river deposit at a shallow depth, any type of dam can be constructed. However, in the
case of a concrete dam, sound rock foundation is most essential. Besides, the disposition
of bedding, foliation, joints, or like structures with respect to their strike and dip need
to be thoroughly studied as low angle down–dip direction of planar rock structure along
downstream direction of a dam is considered unfavourable.
(vii) When a dam site consists of a very thick zone of weathered and decomposed rock including
thick unconsolidated deposit, it is suitable for earth or rock-fi ll dam in which the load of
Chapter_14.indd 311 10/27/2012 12:50:54 PM
312 ● Engineering Geology
the dam is spread over a wide foundation; however, a cut-off (impermeable membrane)
is provided by impervious earth or clay that extends down to impermeable bedrock or
suffi ciently below in natural earth ensuring water tightness.
(ix) Availability of suitable quality stone chips and sand for concrete aggregate is necessary
for a concrete dam. The foundation rock must possess suffi cient bearing strength, roughly
four times the calculated design load due to the dam. Similar to the concrete dam, the
foundation of a masonry dam also requires fi rm rock to withstand the acting forces.
However, masonry dams also need large quantities of dimension stones from quarry sites
of nearby locality or boulders in river bed.
(xii) Rock-fi ll dams require large quantities of rock fragments and also earth. Quarry sites for
construction of dams should be available within a short distance so that the haulage charge
is not prohibitive. Borrow areas for homogeneous and impervious type of earth or clay
are necessary for construction of an earth dam. In fact, availability of desired quality and
quantity of construction materials and the cost involved in their quarrying and haulage are
the primary concerns for selection of type of the dam.
14.6 ADVERSE EFFECTS OF FAULTS IN DAM FOUNDATION AND ITS TREATMENT
The harmful effects of a fault, when present in a dam foundation, are well known to the engineers
and geologists. When a rock mass is subjected to fault movement, it creates a zone of shattered
and pulverized rock, very often containing certain thickness of clayey product called gouge
that has very low modulus of elasticity. If a heavy engineering structure such as a concrete dam
is constructed on this weak zone created by the fault, a stress concentration will take place in
the dam concrete and the weak foundation rock of the fault zone will be deformed. As a safety
measure against such an adverse feature, a plug is provided in such a weak zone as detailed in
the following subsections.
14.6.1 Treatment of a Fault by Plug and Its Depth Calculation
The plug used to treat the fault zone is a seal generally of concrete mass introduced to the soft
zone after removing the soft materials from the fault zone by excavation. On the basis of the study
by the US Bureau of Reclamation, the following formula has been framed to compute the safe
depth of plug that produces elastic qualities and bearing strength equal to that of a sound rock:
D = 0.00066BH + 1.5 for dam height H > 46 m
D = 0.3B + 1.5 for dam height H < or = 46 m
Here H is the height (in metres) of the dam above the general foundation, B is the width (in
metres) of the weak zone, and D is the depth (in metres) of excavation of weak zone. In the case
of gouge seam, D will be greater than 0.1H.
This method of fault treatment was devised after studies of faults in the foundations of Shasta
dam and Friant dam in the US. In these two dams, the modulus of elasticity of the weak zones
was 1/2 to 1/5 times of that of the surrounding sound rocks of the foundation. In the case of a
high-gravity dam, the shear friction factor governs the stability of the dam. The foundation area
occupied by a fault in a dam will have low shearing resistance, which may lead to deformation
or settlement. In order to increase the shearing resistance, the following measures are necessary:
(a) Provide a plug having equal shearing resistance as the sound rock
(b) Widen the base of the dam
In fact, the treatment of a fault zone is carried out considering the effect of deformation due
to fault. The effectiveness of the plug and the optimum depth of the plug can be determined

only after proper investigation of the stress distribution in foundation rock, which is affected by
width, deformability, location, and strike of the faults and the depth of the strengthening plug.
14.6.2 Stresses Along Faults at Different Dispositions
A fault zone lying under a dam is composed of weak gouge materials with low modulus of
elasticity as compared to sound rocks and hence more deformable. The pressure of a fault zone
induces more stress in a foundation as compared to a normal foundation. A fault zone in a
foundation is thus a source of weakness to the foundation and careful studies are warranted to
tackle the problem. The following observations are based on a computer study on faults under
gravity dams (Biswas 1970).
(a) Upstream vertical fault When a fault is located on the upstream of the dam outside the
dam base, it does not pose a serious foundation problem. Vertical stresses induced are of
low orders and the fault zone does not warrant elaborate treatment measures. However,
care should be taken to ensure that the horizontal tensile stress is within the safe limit that
is pronounced up to a depth equal to only half the dam height. Therefore, in an upstream
vertical fault, only the zone extended downstream of the fault needs treatment.
(b) Central fault inclined upstream at an angle of 45° Such an orientation of a fault can
be considered as harmless from structural point of view. When the orientation of a fault
is such that only a small part of the fault stretch is within the dam base, the stresses
induced are similar to a normal foundation. Of course, this hypothesis is true when the
fault is inclined to upstream. In such cases, a dam can be built with minor foundation
treatment. More treatment may be necessary to control seepage, which is dependent on
the permeability of the rock mass.
(c) Centrally located vertical fault In this case, foundation stresses induced are more than
the stress due to the fault sloping upstream. The fault is entirely inside the dam base
indicating compression on the downstream and tension on the upstream sides. Under this
circumstance, probe is necessary for the whole foundation mass and proper treatment
measures should be adopted.
(d) Central fault inclined downstream at an angle of 45° This orientation of fault deserves
full attention and may pose serious problems to design engineers. Presence of this type
of fault induces larger stresses in the foundation. Increase in stresses is 75 per cent to
100 per cent as compared to a normal foundation. Though horizontal normal stress does
not change much, vertical normal stress and principal stresses tend to reach alarming
proportions.
(e) Fault at downstream toe Contrary to the three cases described in cases (a), (b), and (c),
stresses on the upstream side of a fault are more pronounced than those on the downstream
side. Therefore, careful foundation treatment is necessary for the foundation under the
dam. Tensile stress is also induced on the upstream of the dam, which is smaller than that
due to central, vertical, and sloping downstream faults as in cases (c) and (d).
(f) Effect of depth of plug In all these cases stated, stress along the fault and also maximum
stress in the foundation reduce with increases in depth of plug. When a fault is located
upstream of the dam, the stress along the fault increases with increase in depth of plug.
However, maximum stress induced in the foundation gets reduced with increase in the
plug. The reduction in stress for every 5 m increase in depth of plug is not very appreciable.
The current study is for depths of plugs of 10 m, 15 m, 20 m, and 25 m. In case the depth
of plug is increased further, appreciable reduction in stresses will result.
Chapter_14.indd 313 10/27/2012 12:50:54 PM
314 ● Engineering Geology
From the study, it is concluded that a fault on the upstream of the dam or that sloping upstream
from the foundation (cases (a) and (b) poses less problem than a central fault, a fault sloping
downstream, or a downstream fault (cases (c), (d), and (e). In these three cases, the fault needs
elaborate foundation treatment. As the fault shifts upstream to downstream of the dam, foundation
hazard increases, the most acute case being the fault at the downstream toe. In the extreme case,
it is desirable to provide a plug of depth 20 per cent to 30 per cent of dam height. This has been
testifi ed by the photo-elastic studies of Fumio Ishi, Ragguichi Ho Iida, and Isao Shibata (1967).
14.7 CAUSATIVE FACTORS OF DAM DISASTERS
A majority of the dam failures throughout the world is due to adverse geological conditions
of the dam foundation. An analysis of the records of dam disasters suggests that apart from
geological causes, the safety of a dam is also endangered by other causes such as faulty spillway
design, natural calamities, and use of wrong construction materials.
14.7.1 Geological Causes
Poorly compacted sedimentary rocks or other soft rocks when present in the toe or abutment
of a dam may lead to scouring. The bedrock, even with high strength, may be highly fractured.
Some foundation rocks may be porous and permeable allowing seepage or leakage of water
from the reservoir. If the foundation is not watertight, passage of water or piping through it
will develop uplift pressure and bring about failure of the dam. The 25 m-high Dudhawa dam
in Madhya Pradesh developed leakage through a porous sand zone below the foundation rock.
After a period of three years, when it almost led to the failure of the dam as a result of uplift
pressure, the reservoir was emptied and elaborate treatment was undertaken for its safety. The
61 m-high Malpasset concrete arch dam in France is a classic example of failure due to uplift
pressure. The foundation comprising sheared and jointed mica schist was ruptured resulting in
a catastrophic fl ood in 1959 that killed 344 people.
Signifi cant foundation problems arise from the presence of thin beds or laminations in
sedimentary rocks such as clayey siltstone, shale, claystone, and silty shale in the foundation.
These soft layered rocks have low compressive strength and are incapable of withstanding the
load of heavy structures and may lead to plastic deformation or shear failure. Smooth surfaces
of the shale, siltstone, or sandstone dipping at a low angle accentuate sliding tendencies and the
dam may slide along the dipping plane. The 26 m-high and 1.6 km-long Tigra concrete dam in
Madhya Pradesh, consisting of alternating beds of sandstone and shale with low downstream
dip, failed due to sliding after fi lling the reservoir in 1919.
Porous conglomerate and breccia containing clay or calcareous matrix if present in the
foundation undergo disintegration as a result of saturation with reservoir water and in the
process lose their strength. This endangers the stability of the dam. With absorption of water,
the clay, silt, and calcareous matter in the matrix of these rocks are washed away providing
passageways for extensive leakage. Similarly, if the foundation consists of faulted rock causing
crushing and fracturing of the rock, the storage water may cause large-scale seepage through
the crushed rocks, washing away the soft materials. This creates voids in the foundation rock
and the dam may fail by settlement. St. Francis Dam in the US built on soft schistose rock
traversed by a fault failed within two years of its construction.
When incompetent rocks such as shale or claystone occur with competent sandstone beds,
they may bring about failure of the dam by differential settlement. The presence of soft shale
bed alternating with hard sandstone beds in the foundation of the 21 m-high Kedar Nala dam
Chapter_14.indd 314 10/27/2012 12:50:54 PM
Dams and Spillways ● 315
in Madhya Pradesh caused breach of the dam after a heavy rainfall within four months of its
construction in 1964.
There are several instances of dam failures where cavernous limestone was present in the
foundation. Caverns in reservoirs lead to the problem of competency of the reservoir. When
water is impounded in the reservoir, the river detritus that generally fi lls the caverns is washed
away giving way to large-scale leakage and even making the reservoir completely dry.
A landslide is associated with the adverse geology of affected areas such as a fault zone.
Strong vibrations due to the impact of slide create waves in the reservoir water that may pass
over the top of the dam and sometimes cause breach of an embankment dam and bring about
its failure. A concrete dam may survive such breach but the downstream inhabitants will have
to face the devastating effect of water that passes over the dam. In 1963, the Vaiont dam in Italy
failed causing the death of 1900 people. This 266 m-high thin arch dam sustained no damage
in the main shell or abutments. The catastrophe occurred due to a slide caused by the defective
geological features of the reservoir rocks.
Creep and slope failures are regular features in the steep abutment slopes constituted of beds
of shale and sandstone. Sensitive clay (containing montmorillonite) in foundation rocks causes
swelling and slaking under saturated condition and may cause settlement and slide. Large
landslide or failure of hill slope in the storage basin immediate upstream of a dam may have
disastrous consequences. The right abutment of Jaldhaka barrage in West Bengal was affected
by a landslide during the 1964 monsoon, and a huge quantity of the slide debris chocked the
intake structure of the weir at the toe of the dam. In 1962, after heavy rains, the debris caused by
a huge landslide blocked the stream causing fl oods and total damage of the Leimakhong weir,
powerhouse, and other engineering structures in Manipur.
14.7.2 Other Causes
Faulty design of spillway is the common cause of failure of dam by overtopping. If the
volume of fl oodwater exceeds the calculated discharge, the spillway cannot cater to the need
and overtopping or overfl ow takes place. In case of an earth or a rock-fi ll dam, the water
overfl owing the crest of the dam will erode the dam threatening damage or failure of the dam.
If the spillway is part of a concrete dam, the excess fl ow will inundate downstream areas. In
general, hydrological data of 50 to 100 years is required to predict peak fl ow in the design of
a spillway. However, in practice, due to insuffi cient data, the engineers may underestimate the
peak fl ow and design the spillway with assumed value. Such design may lead to overtopping of
dam. The 6 m-high Kali Sind masonry weir in Rajasthan breached in 1960 due to fl oodwater
overtopping the structure. It caused movement of masonry blocks about 30 m downstream.
Failure of the dam may also take place due to lack of proper drainage arrangement in the
design. Absence of drainage results in the saturation of the foundation material. The 18 m-high
Asti dam in Maharashtra constructed in 1883 and again in 1923 failed by saturation of the
foundation and consequent settlement of the structure that slipped in the downstream direction.
Natural calamities such as earthquakes may develop cracks in dams creating avenues for
leakage of large volumes of storage water. It may also bring about complete damage of the dam
if affected by an earthquake of high intensity. At every dam project of India, proper earthquake
factors are incorporated in the design of the dam depending upon the seismic history of the
area. The Koyna dam provided with an earthquake factor of 0.05g (vertical acceleration)
escaped failure during the earthquake of 1967, but some cracks developed in several structures
such as the underground powerhouse, spillway bridge road, and a century-old bridge over the
Chapter_14.indd 315 10/27/2012 12:50:54 PM
316 ● Engineering Geology
Koyna River. The earthquake in 1971 caused liquefaction of the fi ll material in the upstream
wall of the San Fernando dam in the US (California) and the dam failed.
If substandard materials are used in the construction of dams or if the construction material
of an embankment dam is not properly compacted, this may result in internal erosion of dam
material and failure of the dam. The failure of the Teton earth dam in the US (Idaho) in 1976 is
an example. Permeable loess material was used as the core of this dam, which was founded on
fi ssured rhyolite that caused internal erosion or piping and eventual failure of the dam.
A short history of failures of several Indian dams has been furnished in Section 21.7. Table
14.2 shows an assessment of the failure of various dams of the world and that of India in
relation to major causative factors (Chowdhury 1999).

14.8 PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION AND SELECTION OF A DAM SITE
Engineering geological investigation of a dam site is carried out to reveal the geological
conditions of the site with the ultimate aim of assessing the suitability of the site for the
construction of the proposed dam. Adverse geological conditions may affect the feasibility of
the project or enhance the construction cost. Engineering geological investigation is necessary
to identify the geological weakness of a site so that suitable measures can be adopted to rectify
the defects of the dam foundation. In fact, most of the engineering problems of the site are
geological or geology-dependent. A detailed geological study is very important to recognize
these problems prior to selection of the site for dam construction. In general, engineering study
at a dam site is undertaken in different stages.
The geological set-up of a dam site is variable from place to place. Every dam site has its
own characteristics. The purpose of investigation is to unravel these characteristics for their
consideration in the design of the dam. In the preceding sections, the geological factors associated
with dam disasters have been highlighted. While selecting a dam site, it is to be found whether
the site under investigation has any such geological weakness. In fact, many dam sites have
adverse geological conditions that create problems in building the dam in the proposed site.
Thick mantle of weathering or decomposition of rock, presence of soft rock in the foundation,
structural defects such as faults, thrusts, shear zones, and intensive joints are the common defects
of a dam site. Karstic condition and deep zone of kaolinization at dam foundation have caused
Chapter_14.indd 316 10/27/2012 12:50:54 PM
Dams and Spillways ● 317
problems in some projects. A highly permeable boulder deposit or a buried channel below the
dam foundation threatens excessive leakage of reservoir water. Thick deposit of moraine and
avalanche are special problems of high-altitude dam sites, especially in the Himalayan terrain.
In practice, engineers propose one or more alignments, and accordingly geological investigation
is carried out on the site or sites. At the preliminary stage of engineering geological investigation,
geological maps of the different alternative sites are prepared to a scale of 1:1000 or so, plotting
the major geological set-up and main structural features. The merits and demerits of the different
sites are then evaluated and the best site from geological as well as engineering considerations
is selected for further study. Photo-geological study including application of remote sensing
techniques is very helpful in the preliminary stage investigation to prepare a map of regional
geology as well as local geology, covering large areas in and around the dam site within a short
time. The study of aerial or Landsat images will provide a quick appraisal of the broad features
of site conditions with respect to the landform, rock types, and geological structures.
Geological mapping (systematic geological survey maps) covering the project area is carried
out at this initial stage of investigation to understand the regional geology and broad structural
elements. The slope characteristics of the valley walls and the nature of rock exposed or the
approximate thickness of the overburden at the dam site are recorded. Special attention is
provided for the identifi cation of weak features such as a fold, fault, shear zone, clay seam, and
slide scar in the site. The fi eld study helps to understand the merits and demerits of alternative
alignments and choose the most favourable one. The engineering geologist in the course of
investigation may also fi nd a geologically better site than the one proposed by the engineers. The
fi nal selection of the dam site will, however, depend upon the consideration of the engineering
aspects in relation to the geological conditions of the site including the cost factor.
14.9 DETAILED INVESTIGATION OF A DAM SITE FOR DESIGN PURPOSES
After selection of the dam site, a detailed study is undertaken to reveal the surface and subsurface
geology of the site that facilitates design of the structure and estimation of project cost. The
fi rst step in this investigation is the preparation of a large-scale map (scale generally, 1:100 or
1:500), plotting all the lithological units and structural features of the dam site covering at least
100 m areas around the layout of the dam. In case a fault traverses the dam site, its disposition
with reference to dam axis and other details such as thickness of crushed zone are to be recorded
in the map. If the river bed at the dam site is covered by a river deposit, the character of the
deposit including its thickness is recorded.
The next step is the exploratory work such as pitting, trenching, and drilling to assess the depth
to bedrock and the rock types of the dam site. The most important of the exploratory works is
the drilling to reveal the subsurface geology of the dam site including geological structures from
the logging of the drill cores. A plan is prepared plotting in a map the location of the drill holes
including their inclination and direction and the approximate depth to penetrate is suggested.
In general, the drill holes are made vertical; however, due to water cover in the river bed, inclined
holes are drilled from the two sides so as to pass through the central part of the river.
The drill core logging helps to understand the subsurface geological condition of the site
including bedrock and fresh rock depths and draw profi les for foundation grade of the proposed
dam. In addition to drilling, drifts are made at the abutments in case of concrete dams to estimate
the weathering profi le and examine abutment condition. Geophysical method is also applied in
some sites to reveal the subsurface geology, especially adverse structural features such as faults
and folds and the presence of a large cavity and buried channel.
Chapter_14.indd 317 10/27/2012 12:50:54 PM
318 ● Engineering Geology
Laboratory tests on rocks and soil of the site are also conducted for quantitative assessment of
their engineering properties to meet the design requirement. Undisturbed samples of unconsolidated
deposit and rock cores are used in the testing. In some sites for concrete dams with weak foundation
condition or complicated geological set-up, in situ test is carried out to understand the rock
behaviour under stress condition. In general, plate load test is conducted to fi nd the load-bearing
capacity of soil mass and soft band or zones of weathered rock of dam foundation.
NX-drill holes with diamond bits are necessary to obtain maximum recovery of rock cores in
hard rock. The logging of rock cores is done with diagrammatic representation and recording the
following information: (a) rock type or types, (b) depth to bedrock or thickness of overburden
material, (c) the thickness of weathered rock or the depth to fresh or foundation grade rock, (d) the
percentage of core recovery and rock quality designation, (e) fracture frequency of cores, and (f)
shear zone, clay seam, and any other weak feature, if any. Field permeability tests are also conducted
through the bore holes to assess the permeability characteristics of the porous and fractured rocks.
The logging of rock cores and results of permeability tests are presented schematically (Figs 11.21
and 11.11), which help the engineers in designing a structure. Some portions of the cores obtained
from drilling are sent to the rock testing laboratory for conducting tests on various engineering
properties such as the density, porosity, and compressive strength required for design purposes.
Geological structures observed in the surface in and around the dam site and that revealed
from the drill holes are studied in detail and also plotted in geological maps. Many of the
structural features such as faults and shear zones are weak features and their presence may lead
to stability and leakage problems for the proposed dam. The dam site may be covered by river
deposit but study of the surrounding area might suggest the presence of a fold or fault at the dam
site, which can be substantiated from the drill holes. Morphological expression also helps in the
interpretation such as a straight river valley being indicative of a probable fault passing along
the valley, which is proved from drill holes. The details of the structures such as faults and folds
that may affect the rocks of the dam site are studied in detail with respect to the gouge zone, clay
seams, tension cracks, and so on and probable treatment for the affected zones are proposed.
14.10 SOURCE OF BUILDING MATERIALS FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF DAMS
Different types of building materials are needed according to the engineering structures. For
example, a concrete dam needs concrete which is made of cement and aggregates generally
available from natural sources. Similarly, a masonry dam requires durable rock blocks for
building masonry structures. The following describes the details.
14.10.1 Building Materials for Concrete Dams
The aggregate materials such as cobbles, pebbles (shingles), gravel, sand, or crushed rock
are mixed with cement in different proportions to make concrete of required strength as in the
design of a concrete dam. River bed and terrace deposits are the natural sources of the concrete
aggregate materials. The materials for concrete aggregate are also obtained by excavation of
the exposed rocks and crushing them and screening into proper sizes. The river-borne shingles
and gravels due to their long transportation by the river water develop smooth and round
surfaces that help better bonding and low consumption of cement. Pozzolan and fl y ash, where
available, are used as a substitute of cement in certain proportions. In practice, concrete used
in the construction of a dam may have more than one type of mix. Table 14.3 provides a list
of different mixes (weight of aggregates and cement) used in the Umiam concrete dam in
Meghalaya for one cubic metre of concrete.

*Coarse aggregate constitutes quartzite, meta-dolerite, and arenaceous phyllite having strength
above 1760 kg/cm2 and the silt and clay (particles size < 0.15 mm) content is 2.7%.
The aggregate materials are fi rst subjected to various tests to fi nd their suitability for use
in the dam construction. The tests on coarse aggregate and rocks include density, absorption,
strength (compression, shear, and tension), abrasion, impact, soundness, modulus of elasticity,
and chemical reactivity. Petrological tests are also conducted to fi nd the mineral content in
relation to deleterious materials. The materials for earth dams are tested for properties such as
liquid and plastic limits, consolidation, cohesion, shear, angle of internal friction, permeability,
and slacking. Indian Standard Institution (ISI) has provided the specifi cation for coarse
aggregate materials, which is followed in making concrete for dam construction (Section 12.4).
In practice, the specifi cation may be changed to some extent depending upon the availability of
the aggregate materials and the design requirement of the concrete strength.
14.10.2 Boulders and Rock Fragments for Masonry Dams
Masonry structures are constructed using large boulders of river deposits. When boulders of the
requisite size and quality are not available in river beds, these are obtained in large fragments or
slabs by quarrying rocky hill faces and are used in masonry works after chiselling into blocks.
The main considerations in masonry dam construction are availability and suitability of the
rocks conforming to the specifi cation of the ISI. All common igneous and metamorphic rocks
such as granite, basalt, charnockite, granite gneiss, quartzite, and quartzitic phyllite (Tables 10.1
and 10.3 of Section 10.4) are hard, sound, and durable and possess high strength fulfi lling the
required specifi cations such as G > 2.6 and compressive strength > 1760 kg/cm2. Sedimentary
rocks such as Vindhyan sandstone (Table 10.2) and quartzitic sandstone (Cuddapah) and some
varieties of dolomite are also suitably used as masonry blocks for dam construction.
On account of the absence of requisite quantity and quality of construction materials, the design
of the proposed 31 m-high Gumti dam at Tripura had to be changed to a brick masonry structure
with a thick concrete lining all around. The bricks for the dam were made out of local clay. Even for
concrete aggregate, crushed bricks (8000 m3) had to be mixed with crushed calcareous sandstone
pebbles (12,000 m3) collected from the stream beds nearly 30 km away from the dam site.
14.10.3 Fill Materials for Rock-fi ll Dams
Compared to masonry dams, rock-fi ll dams are more favoured in modern time as they are
more economical. A rock-fi ll dam uses the entire deposit in a river or terrace as fi ll materials
Chapter_14.indd 319 10/27/2012 12:50:54 PM
320 ● Engineering Geology
constituted of boulders, pebbles, gravels, sand, and clay. The rock fragments quarried from
nearby rocky hill slopes are also used. In the mountainous terrains, the river valleys, hill
slopes, and terraces contain plenty of construction material for rock-fi ll dams, and if the dam is
proposed in the valley, the haulage charge will also be less. However, the overall quality of the
bulk material will conform to the design requirement.
The Salal rock-fi ll dam in Jammu and Kashmir used dolomite boulders as the fi ll materials
taken from the river deposits upstream and downstream of the dam site and also from the
terrace deposits of the locality. In addition, stripping of the abutments also gave large quantities
of rocks for the rock-fi ll. However, as dolomite beds were highly fractured, massive Murre
sandstones were used for rip-rap purpose. The demand for nearly 1.7 million cubic metres of
impervious material required for the core of the dam was met by using the clayey soil from
three borrow areas located at a distance of 10 km to 11 km from the dam site.
14.10.4 Sandy and Clayey Material for Earth Dams
Sand, silt, and clay, the decomposed products of rocks, are available in plenty in most parts of
the projects, especially in the reservoir basins. The decayed rock of hill slopes especially in areas
composed of sedimentary rocks are generally devoid of pebbles and boulders and are found to have
good quality material for use in earth dams. Both pervious and semi-pervious types of materials are
necessary for the earth dams. After removal of overburden layers, the rock surfaces are generally
semi-pervious in nature. Earth samples are collected from borrow pits for testing their properties.
Depending upon the quantity required for the dam, the borrow areas are selected in the reservoirs
and in the foothill areas in and around the project.
14.10.5 Rip-rap for Protecting Dam Slopes
Rip-rap constitutes slabs of rock used to cover
the upstream slope of an earth or a rock-fi ll
dam to protect the dam body from the eroding
process of nature and wave action (Fig. 14.25).
The rocks for the rip-rap should be hard and
durable. They are collected from the river bed
or terrace deposits after screening out unwanted
fractions. If river boulders are not available
in suffi cient quantity, they are obtained from
quarrying the hard rocks available locally. The
cost of transportation is an important factor to
be considered while selecting quarry sites for

durable rocks covers upstream slope of an earth dam rip-rap.
in Bihar Loosely compact boulder beds in sedimentary
formation are also mined and boulders separated
by screening to use as rip-rap materials. The desirable compressive strength of the rip-rap is
350 kg/cm2, which is attained by many rock types including limestone, sandstone, phyllite, and
schist (Tables 10.1, 10.2, and 10. 3 of Section 10.4). The Vindhyan sandstones having density
2.65 kg/cm3, absorption 0.85–1.94 per cent, and compressive strength 550–1975 kg/cm2 are
used as masonry blocks as well as rip-raps. In the absence of any durable rock, concrete blocks
are also used as rip-rap material.

14.10.6 Impervious Core Materials for a Dam
The availability of materials to be used for the core or shell of rock-fi ll and earth dams varies
from project to project depending upon the country rocks and their decomposition or the nature
of overburden material. Ideally, this should be a well-graded mixture of sand gravel and fi nes
with highly plastic tough clay, having plasticity index more than 20. However, if the earth
contains grains in different proportions, say, sand and silt in large quantities, then it may be
blended with clayey earth to achieve the required compactness and impervious character. In
some projects, suffi cient quantity of suitable earth for the shell may not be available. In such
cases, crushed soft rocks are mixed as per design requirement for use as core materials of
rock-fi ll and earth dams. The Beas project in Himachal Pradesh successfully utilized for the
core material 50 per cent crushed sandy-rock mixed with 50 per cent clay–shale exhibiting the
properties shown in Table 14.4 (Ray, Mehta, and Ashraf 1972).

14.10.7 Guidelines for Selecting Sites for Building Materials
Selection of sites for available construction materials is an important part of planning stage
investigation. The availability of the required quality and quantity of the construction materials
is the deciding factor for the proposed type of dam. It may not be possible to construct a
masonry or rock-fi ll dam if suitable quality and suffi cient quantity of rocks are not available
in the nearby areas. Similarly, paucity of earth and impervious clay may restrict the possibility
of constructing an earth dam. In general, borrow areas for earth may be searched in reservoir
basins and rocks in the hill slopes. As a construction material, the word stone is generally used
by the engineers, which is rock to geologists. Quarry sites for rocks requiring blasting to obtain
rock fragments are selected at least one kilometre away from the dam site so that the blasting
does not affect the dam.
While selecting quarry sites for aggregate materials for a concrete dam from river beds or hill
slopes, care should be taken to ensure that they do not contain minerals reactive with cement
used in making the concrete. It is necessary that samples of concrete made with the stone chips
and sand of the selected quarry sites are tested in the laboratory to ensure that it does not show
any alkali–aggregate reaction. It involves the petrological study of a thin section of the concrete
sample under microscope to fi nd alkali reactivity.
As stated earlier, borrow areas for both pervious and semi-pervious earth may be searched in the
reservoir basin. Impervious earth is especially necessary for the core of rock-fi ll and earth dams. It
is available in the areas represented by sedimentary rocks such as shale or clay stone, the decay of
which produces a thick mantle of impervious earth overlying the bedrock. Partly decayed products
of rocks found below the topsoil in the periphery of the reservoir spread or in the hill slope of the
surrounding areas provide suitable semi-pervious earth required for earth dams.
Chapter_14.indd 321 10/27/2012 12:50:54 PM
322 ● Engineering Geology
Earth containing high percentage of organic material should be avoided. Similarly, borrow area
for clay should not contain harmful clay minerals such as montmorillonite and bentonite, which
generally occur in basaltic terrain. In some areas such as ancient glaciated regions, overconsolidated
clay may be present, which develops high pressure under saturated conditions and may cause
harmful effects on dam body if it is made of this clay. The earth or clay is to be tested in the
laboratory for the types of clay minerals present in it. If the earth possesses a considerable quantity
of harmful clay minerals such as montmorillonite, it will cause excessive swelling under saturated
conditions, which may develop suffi cient expansion pressure to breach the dam body.
For rock-fi ll dams, fi ll materials such as broken rocks or boulders and earth of huge quantity are
obtained from debris of hill slopes or from boulder deposits of river beds. Huge quantities of spoils
such as broken rocks and earth are available from the excavation of diversion channels or tunnels
in a dam project. In earth and rock-fi ll dams, spillway excavation also provides large quantities
of broken rocks and earth. Cutting of hill slopes for new roads by diversion of old roads from
reservoir areas also supplies spoils such as earth, clay, and rock fragments of varying dimensions.
The broken rocks including the earth and clay obtained from these sources may meet the demand
of fi ll materials to a great extent and thus reduce the construction cost of a rock-fi ll dam.
14.11 RIVER DIVERSION AND
CONSTRUCTION WORK
Construction work of a dam can start only after
diversion of the river water. Diversion work
is generally done during the dry season when
the quantity of fl ow in river water is less than
in the rainy season. Figure 14.26 shows earth
movers and trucks being used in the removal
of river detritus after diversion of the river at
the beginning of the construction of the Umiam
concrete dam. High-power pumps with long pipes
are in operation for fl ushing away accumulated
Fig. 14.26 Removal of river detritus after diversion
water from the site. See Fig. 14.3 for the Umiam
of river
dam under construction. The method of diversion
depends upon the morphology and geology of the dam site and its immediate surrounding areas
as detailed in the following subsections.
14.11.1 Methods of Diverting Rivers
The fi rst step is the construction of a cofferdam, which is a small dam used for the temporary purpose
of diverting river water from its original path for a certain distance. The diversion is done by two
ways. In the fi rst method, a cofferdam is constructed at the upstream part of the dam foundation and
the river water is diverted by means of a tunnel or channel through the bank. The second method
is the in-river diversion where the cofferdam restricts the fl ow to a side by contraction of the river
channel to 30 per cent to 60 per cent. The cofferdam, though a small structure, is designed with due
consideration of the river discharge, stability factor, and scouring effect.
The choice of diversion method depends on the discharge capacity of the river and the
morphology as well as geology of the site. If the discharge is large and valley abutment consists
of hard rock, a tunnel alignment is always taken up. The tunnel diversion is more justifi ed when
the tunnel is planned for use as a service spillway. The cofferdam constructed at the upstream

Dams and Spillways ● 323
part for diverting the water should be located at least 10 m upstream. Sometimes, there may be a
need to build another cofferdam at the downstream part to arrest the back fl ow of the water from
the tunnel or channel outlet. The channel used for diverting the water may be one or more in
number and excavated through the abutment slope. A channel diversion is more economical but
the presence of hard and stable rock is necessary to avoid the chance of scouring and sliding.
In the in-river diversion method, the foundation work of the dam is executed in the river channel
while the cofferdam remains partly or fully in river water. This method is normally taken up if the
foundation is made of cohesive material and the proposed dam is of medium height. The cofferdam
may be of overtopped or non-overtopped type with respect to fl oodwater. In the fi xed crested type,
the construction can be continued round the year. However, in the overfl ow type, the work needs to
be stopped for a few months when due to heavy rain, fl ood discharge passes over the cofferdam to
inundate the foundation. After a certain lapse of time, the construction work begins with dewatering
of the foundation. The diversion method may also be a combination of both the methods where
the stream water fl ows partly through the side and partly through the channel over the abutment.
14.11.2 Foundation Preparation
The most important part in dam construction is the foundation preparation, which starts when
the dam site becomes dry after diversion of the river water. The engineering geologist remains
constantly present at the site to decide on the foundation grade rock on which the dam can
be safely founded. The fi rst step in the foundation preparation is removal of the river detritus
or overburden material from the river bed. The bedrock necessary to found a concrete dam is
obtained below this loose deposit, but the rock may be in a state of decomposition, which is
to be removed by excavation. If blasting is used to remove the decomposed rocks from the
foundation, this must be of mild nature so that the vibration does not develop cracks in the fresh
and sound rock of dam site including abutments.
This is followed by striping of the weathered rock surface including clay seams, fault gouge,
and pockets of soft materials from the foundation. The resident geologist is to identify weak zones
and get them removed until fresh rock is available. The cavities or openings formed from striping
are subjected to dental treatment, which involves fi lling them by concrete. If a fault passes through
the foundation, its disposition and attitudes are studied carefully, and it is treated by removing the
fractured and gouge material from the fault zone and then providing concrete plug.
The foundation rocks may be porous or jointed to different extents when treatment by
grouting is adopted. Consolidation grouting is undertaken in the foundation that seals the void
spaces or openings in porous and jointed rocks and enhances the load-bearing capacity of the
foundation. In addition, curtain grouting is taken up and drainage holes are provided at the
upstream end of a concrete dam to guard against seepage and prevent uplift pressure. The fi rst
type of grouting is done by comparatively shallow holes, but deep holes are taken up for curtain
grouting from the gallery of the dam (see Sections 13.6 and 13.7).
14.11.3 Construction Approaches for Different Types of Dams
After treating the weak zones and strengthening the rocks by grouting, the foundation becomes
ready for laying concrete for construction of concrete dams. A batching plant located within a
short distance from the dam site mixes aggregate materials including stone chips or pebbles, sand,
and cement in fi xed proportions (as per design) to attain the strength as required by the design of
the dam (Fig. 14.27). The concrete from the batching plant is directly placed on the foundation
rocks in layers until the design height is attained. Cylinders or cubes of the concrete are tested
Chapter_14.indd 323 10/27/2012 12:50:54 PM
324 ● Engineering Geology
in the laboratory to ensure the desired strength.
To facilitate concreting work, the foundation is
marked into different segments and concrete is laid
in these blocks as per plan. The concreting work
of the spillway and other structures within the
dam is also taken up side by side so that the dam
attains its full height along with its appurtenant
structures as per the design plan.
The foundation preparation for the construction
of a rock-fi ll dam is more or less the same as that of
the concrete dam. After removal of the overburden
Fig. 14.27 A batching plant where aggregates material, the dam is founded on bedrock having
and cement are mixed in fi xed proportions to make adequate strength to withstand the forces acting on
concrete of design strength it. The rock fragments of different sizes hauled from
the quarry sites and dumped on the foundation are compressed with the help of huge machineries.
The work of placement and compression of the impervious earth in the central part or concreting of
the upstream face (as per design) is continued side by side with the construction of the rock-fi ll dam.
The earth dam is built on natural earth and does not require rock foundation. The loose
materials from the top surface are, however, removed by excavation to obtain the underlying
layer of earth and spread over and rolled by
further layers suitable for earth dam foundation.
Figure 14.28 shows an earth dam with layers of
rolled earth and the upper central trench is to
place impervious clay in the core. Earth from
borrow areas (with predetermined suitability
from the fi eld and laboratory tests as outlined in
Chapter 6) for construction of the dam are then
transported to the dam site and dumped on the
foundation and compressed into layers. The most
important consideration is the design aspect of
the compression including the central clay core.
Figure 14.29 shows an earth dam in Bihar under
Fig. 14.28 Earth dam with layers of rolled earth construction with excavated hill slope material
and earth partially compressed for foundation
grade in partly weathered rock. A trench has been
dug at the central part (core) for laying impervious
clay. The compression reduces the permeability
and increases the density and strength of the
earth so that there will be no settlement during
the lifespan of the dam. It is to be ensured that
the dam body becomes impermeable to the
extent that there is no passage for water to cause
the problem of piping.
Once the foundation area or a part of it is
ready to lay the concrete or dump earth or rock,
it is the primary duty of the resident geologist to

compressed excavated hill slope material and earth undertake geological mapping to a suffi ciently

large scale plotting all the geological details of the foundation. This map is an important record of
the dam foundation. In case of any post-construction problems related to weakness of foundation
or leakage through shear zones and so on, this map acts as a guide to identify the probable zone or
geological feature responsible for causing the problem and thus helps to take appropriate remedial
measures to solve the problem.
When the construction of the proposed dam reaches a height that is more than that of the
cofferdam, the latter becomes defunct. The diversion tunnel or channel excavated for temporary
diversion of river is then of no use. Hence, the tunnel or channel used for diversion of river is
sealed at its two ends to stop further fl ow. The river water is then stored in the reservoir behind
the dam for various utilities.
Several instruments are installed in a dam to monitor its behaviour in the post-construction
period. The following are the common instruments:
(i) Piezometric cells placed in observation wells and drainage bore holes to measure the
uplift and pore water pressure
(ii) Extensometer, clinometer, deformation meter, and tiltmeter to record the movement of the
foundation
(iii) Stress and strain meters for measuring the stress and strain in foundation or dam body
(iv) Seismographs for measuring micro-seismic movement
(v) Discharge measuring devices to monitor if any seepage takes place.
The instruments monitor abrupt behaviour of the dam, if any, during the post-construction
period and accordingly safety measures are undertaken.
14.12 POST-CONSTRUCTION WORK
Engineering geological investigation is necessary for many of the post-construction problems
of a dam. If the problems are geological in nature or created by natural calamities such as
fl oods, landslides, and earthquakes, then the engineering geologists attend to such problems to
fi nd a rational solution. Seepage is a common problem in the post-construction stage. Tracer
study is conducted to delineate the zone and grouting is recommended to seal the path of
seepage. Blockage of drainage holes or malfunctioning of grout curtain may develop uplift
pressure of serious consequence in a dam after its completion. In a 49 m-high masonry dam
in Madhya Pradesh, the drainage holes were choked and the grout curtain did not function
properly. Excessive leakage was observed in the dam after construction and it required the
lowering of the reservoir level and revitalization of drain holes.
Percolation of water through the body of a masonry or concrete dam along the construction
joint, contraction joint, mortar joint, foundation contacts, and cracks is a common phenomenon.
This causes seepage of water and consequent scouring of dam body and development of uplift
pressure. Gradually, the condition of the dam deteriorates leading to large leakage and distress
of the structures. Safe design of the dam for a stable structure is required to eliminate such
possibilities that result in the failure of the structure.
The fi lling of reservoirs may trigger landslides or even earthquakes that affect the dam or its
appurtenant structures. These aspects require in-depth geological study and immediate advice
for suitable treatment. Scouring or cavity formation at the downstream part of the dam due to
spilled water is a common problem in many dams detected after some years of dam construction.
The Sikasar project in Madhya Pradesh experienced scouring due to the presence of soft shale
with quartzite in the spill channel foundation. It required providing fl exible sausage as training
wall to stop the scouring for saving an earth dam close to the spill channel.
Chapter_14.indd 325 10/27/2012 12:50:55 PM
326 ● Engineering Geology
In general, with time, the construction material of the dam gets degraded due to improper
maintenance. Common causes of material deterioration are leaching of lime from cement,
alkali–aggregate reaction, and sulphate in rock causing surface spalling which affect the safety
of the structure. The Hirakud dam after its completion developed cracks due to alkali–aggregate
reaction. In the Dudhganga dam in Maharashtra, the pyrite in quartzite caused swelling and
spalling in the dam body. The Tong barrage in Madhya Pradesh with gypsiferous shale in the
construction material caused cavitations in the post-construction period requiring geological
investigation and immediate treatment.
During the construction of a dam, several instruments are installed in a dam to understand its
functioning. If any geology-related problem is indicated in the post-construction stage by the
behaviour of the instrument, the attention of the engineering geologist is immediately drawn for
fi nding a solution to the problem in cooperation with the engineers.

15.1 INTRODUCTION
A reservoir is created by the construction of a dam for storage and supply of water
for irrigation, drinking, hydroelectricity generation, and various other purposes.
Construction of a reservoir brings about changes in the geo-hydrological condition
of the neighbouring areas as well as social and ecological changes of the reservoir
area. Over a period of time, the storage capacity of a reservoir dwindles due to
siltation. Investigation of a reservoir site lays emphasis on ensuring that no leakage
takes place and no national assets such as minerals of economic importance and
historical monuments are submerged under storage condition. In recent times, the
pumped storage scheme, which uses the same water in two reservoirs to generate
electricity, is found economical when suitable topography is available. This chapter
deals with all these aspects associated with reservoir construction.
15.2 CREATION AND FUNCTIONS OF RESERVOIRS
A reservoir is a man-made water body created by constructing a dam across a river
(Fig. 15.1). The reservoir water is used to meet the various needs of the people and
industry. A reservoir stores water during excess fl ow in the river and releases it in
times of scarcity when the natural fl ow of the river is inadequate.
The fl ow pattern of the river and its tributaries decides the shape of the water body
of the lake. The reservoirs of upland hilly terrains are generally spoon shaped with
tail ends extending for several kilometres along the upstream valley. In plains, the
reservoir spread is erratic due to its spread following the river channel and its tributaries.
Chapter_15.indd 328 10/18/2012 7:02:19 PM
Reservoirs ● 329
The storage capacity of a reservoir depends on the
rainfall and run-off in the surrounding catchment
areas. The rainfall of the catchment area must
be adequate enough to fi ll the reservoir up to the
maximum level.
The height of a dam decides the maximum
(full) reservoir level (FRL) up to which water can
Arch dam Reservoir water be stored. In practice, however, water level is kept
below this level in normal time. If the quantity
of water (storage up to FRL) tends to exceed this
level due to heavy rains in the catchment area, the

through the spillway. The reservoir level below
which water does not go down even during dry season is called the drawdown level, dead capacity
level (DCL), or dead storage level (DSL). The volume of water between the FRL and DCL is the
active capacity or live storage of a reservoir. The quantity of water that remains below the DCL is
the dead storage capacity. The reservoir spread at FRL is called the water surface area (Fig. 15.2).

The portion of rain that fl ows as run-off over the catchment area ultimately drains into the
river causing increase in the reservoir water. Thus, the volume of storage water depends to a
great extent on the rainfall and run-off of the catchment area. Table 15.1 shows the annual run-
off and rainfall in the catchment area and the fl ow characteristics of the river Barakar, which
feeds the reservoirs of Maithon and Tilaiya dams in the Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC)
(Gangopadhyay and Majumdar 1989).

In general, a dam project for storage of water is benefi cial to the human community.
Impounded water in a reservoir provides hydroelectric power, which is rather cheap compared to
other sources of power. The benefi cial functions of reservoirs are many. Irrigation, water supply,
fl ood control, transportation, fi sh farming, tourism development, and several other benefi ts can
be obtained from the reservoir. India has constructed several high dams in different states with
large reservoir capacity (Table 15.2). Nearly 92 per cent of Indian dams are built to utilize the
water of the reservoirs for irrigation purposes, 2 per cent for hydroelectric power, and the rest
for multiple purposes including water supply, power generation, irrigation, and fl ood control.

Distribution of reservoir water to the users involves laying pipelines or excavation of tunnels
or channels with intake and outlet structures at the two ends that regulate the quantum of
fl ow. In a hydroelectric power station, huge quantity of water from the reservoir is allowed to

pass through penstock pipes and fall on turbines under high head for generation of electricity.
Sometimes, reservoir water is diverted to the downstream part of the dam to discharge into
the normal course of the river from where the water is taken for irrigation by channel. When a
dam is built for fl ood control, the storage level of water is kept far below the FRL so that large
parts of the reservoir remain empty. This helps the excess fl ow to accumulate in the empty
space during fl oods and to release it to the downstream valley to save the localities around the
reservoir from fl ood havoc.
Creation of a reservoir has several adverse effects too. Villages, forests, cultivated lands,
and even roads, rails, mineral deposits, and archaeological and historical monuments may
be submerged with the construction of reservoirs. The major impact is the environmental
degradation. The equilibrium of the wildlife and environment is disturbed and the landscape
changed with degrading shore. The fi lling of reservoirs infl uences the biological regime of
the surrounding terrains. Submergence of forest and farmlands produces biological wastes
stored in the reservoir. These biological products supply food to the fi sh and help their growth.
Fish farming is possible if such organic matter occurs in the reservoir in suffi cient quantity.
However, excessive growth of weeds and algae and their decay cause pollution of the lake water
with deteriorating effect on its fi sh population.
15.3 DEGRADATION OF CATCHMENT AND RESERVOIR RIM AREAS
Construction of a large storage structure degrades the catchment area. Degradation negatively
affects the dam and the reservoir. Once a reservoir is fi lled with water, both the surface and the
groundwater regimes are disturbed. The water table of the areas around the reservoir rises. The
alluvium of the reservoir valley gets saturated and the water body exerts increased pressure on the
basin bottom. Under the new situation, the previously dry lands adjacent to the reservoir rim get
saturated with seepage of water. The saturation of the ground by backwater along with wave action
on water surface accentuates land subsidence and slides along the periphery of the reservoir.
The reservoir may be in hilly areas or in lowlands. The lowland areas undergo maximum
degradation with the fi rst fi lling of the reservoir when abrading action of saturated ground
brings about rapid change in the morphology of peripheral areas. The reservoir fl oor also gets
rapid fi lling from the denuded shore materials. After a lapse of certain time, the rate of siltation
and erosional effect is reduced and a stable condition is obtained. Lowlands of alluvial type
infl uence more deposition of sediments compared to hilly regions.
In mountainous regions, the water body of a reservoir covering the narrow valleys is generally
of low capacity. The fi lling of reservoir in this terrain causes infi ltration of water through the
debris and joints in rocks at the hill slope, initiating rock fall and debris slide. The fallen debris
will be easily abraded and transported to the reservoir fl oor. Due to selective siltation, the
tail end of the reservoir of a hilly terrain may be choked along the rim areas. The size of the
depositing materials may be big and thus the volume of deposition may be suffi cient, and
the capacity of the reservoir will be reduced within a short period.
The creation of a reservoir by constructing a dam in the upstream part of a river controls
its downstream fl ow pattern to a great extent. Daily fl uctuation of the run-off below the dam
may be associated with the peak load operation of the power plant resulting in irregular stream
fl ow. The river bed of the lower reaches changes its hydrological regime. An intensive scouring
of the river valley takes place by the water with silts spilled from the reservoir during fl oods.
If the fl ow with load of silt is small, it will cause only limited scouring. However, excessive
fl ood discharge results in deep scouring of the downstream land. The fl ood water inundates the

332 ● Engineering Geology
housing areas of the downstream valley causing distress to the people. Another effect is the
drop in water level, which affects agriculture and water supply to the adjacent areas.
15.4 EROSION OF CATCHMENT AREA AND RESERVOIR SEDIMENTATION
Eroion of catchment area is caused bv various natural aqgencies of which rainfall is the main
agent. After a shower, the eroded materials from the catchment area get deposited in the
reservoir basin resulting is a decrease in reservoir capacity. The following gives a detailed
description of this aspect.
15.4.1 Relation of Erosion with Rainfall
The varied natural agencies and geological processes such as extensive weathering of rock and
erosion of slope materials affected by landslide and mass movement are responsible for change
in landform of catchment areas. This is especially true in high rainfall and mountainous areas
where steep slopes and considerable velocities of the stream water facilitate rapid transportation
of the eroded materials as bed load and partly in suspension that ultimately accumulate in
the reservoirs. In an attempt to quantify the erosion of a terrain caused by various processes,
Murthy (1977) gave an equation that can be expressed as
E = IRS1.35 L0.35 P1.75
The equation shows that E (soil loss) will be of increasing order with increasing values of I, R,
S, L, and P. Here, I is the inherent erodibility of the soil, R is a factor describing cover condition,
S is the degree of slope in per cent, L is the length of the slope in feet, and P is the maximum
30 minute-intensity rainfall (in inches), covering the last 2 years. In Eastern Himalayas, the annual
rainfall is as high as 500 cm. There are records of rainfall up to 78 cm per hour continued for eight
hours and of more than 1 cm rain per hour prolonged continuously for days together in the past
70 years. All these records indicate very high P value for the terrain. The steep slope S with great
length L and unstable hill cover materials (to provide a high value of R) has been established from
a study of mountainous terrain (Gangopadhyay 1978). The study indicated that hill slopes with
values higher than 19° are liable to slide during monsoon. This unstable mountain slope material
accounts for a high value of R. Thus, all values of P, L, S, R, and L being high, it is expected that
E, the soil loss of the catchment area due to erosion, will also be high and consequently it will
result in high rate of sedimentation of the reservoir (Fig. 15.3).

Reservoirs ● 333
Studies estimated that 40,000 m3 of silt gets deposited in the Umiam Lake in Meghalaya
every year. Such high rate of siltation decreases the storage capacity and increases water loss
by evaporation.
15.4.2 Sedimentation (Siltation) Rate
All rivers carry suspended sediments consisting of sand, silt, and clay-sized particles. The area
below the DCL is the place of accumulation of sediments transported from the surrounding areas.
The rate of sediment deposition in the reservoirs varies from river to river. The sedimentation or
siltation becomes intensive during rainy season due to increased run-off capacity. Silt deposited
in the reservoir from its surrounding areas reduces its capacity and as such shortens the life of
the dam. If soft rock or loose sandy and silty soil is present in the catchments, rains wash the
materials easily and streams carry the large load of silt and deposit it into the reservoir. The
huge quantity of debris deposited in the reservoir basin from slides in the peripheral regions
decreases the life of the reservoir.
Deforestation of lands around the reservoir areas enhances soil erosion and increases the silt
fl ow in the reservoir basins. In such reservoirs of anticipated high siltation, an auxiliary dam
is constructed upstream of the main dam to reduce the siltation. The quantity of silt carried by
a stream that will be deposited in the reservoir after construction of dam is calculated in the
design of the dam based on some assumptions. The statistics of siltation rate of some Indian
dams show that the actual rate of siltation is many times more than the assumed rate, and as a
result the life expectancy is reduced to a great extent (Table 15.3). Life of reservoir refers to the
physical life based on the rates of siltation assumed at the designed stage and later observed.

15.4.3 Measurement of Siltation
The annual rate of silt deposition in a reservoir under storage condition is measured by survey
method. First, a contour map of the reservoir area is prepared by ground survey prior to storing
water (empty condition). Permanent reference points (benchmarks) are kept on the ground on
Chapter_15.indd 333 10/18/2012 7:02:20 PM
334 ● Engineering Geology
both sides of the reservoir. Second, contour map of the reservoir area under storage condition is
then prepared at the given time interval after reservoir fi lling following the range method. The
directions (ranges) are fi rst marked on the map with reference to the permanent reference points
coinciding with certain fi xed feature of the previous survey map.
The depth of the river with respect to the water surface of the time is measured by means
of a sounding pole or the echo-sounding instrument while moving in a country boat from one
bank to the other. The boat carries a long wire (with distance marked) rolled in a wheel. As the
boat moves, the wheel unrolls the wire to facilitate measurement of the distance covered. A
man with walkie-talkie guides the direction of movements of the boat. Once the contour map
for the storage condition is prepared, the volume of silt deposit in the given time is known from
the planimetric measurement of the areas between two contours. The silt deposit of a reservoir
basin is generally expressed as ‘annual rate of siltation’ in ha/1000 km2. From the given time
in years, the annual rate of silt deposit in the total reservoir area (in km2) can be obtained from
dividing the total volume (ha m) by the number of years.
15.4.4 Siltation Study by Remote Sensing and Aerial Photographs
Satellite imageries and aerial photographs are important tools in the investigation of reservoirs
including siltation. The false colour composite images of Landsat 2, 3, and 4 depict the land
use, land cover, geomorphology and drainage pattern, and the reservoir water directly affecting
the infl ow sediments in the reservoirs in the case of DVC projects. High siltation zone was
observed at the meeting of the river Barakar with the river Damodar because the sediment-
carrying capacity is suddenly slowed down and silt spread gradually into the reservoir mouth
(Srivastava and Rao 1991)
Study of aerial photograph is carried out in the reservoir basin covering the catchment area
for a rapid evaluation of the geological and hydrological conditions. The stereoscopic study of
overlapping photographs enables assessment of the water storage capacity of a reservoir basin for
a particular dam height. The study examines the catchment area and reveals the characteristics that
infl uence the reservoir under storage conditions. These include morphological features, whether
hilly or lowland; stream gradient and its effect on run-off; drainage pattern; ground slope and
ground use, viz. whether terrace cultivation; erosional intensity along reservoir periphery, whether
protective measures are necessary; forest cover, which retard the run-off; and river features such
as meandering river, oxbow lake, and silt bar. Geological characteristics such as overburden cover,
rock outcrops, structural pattern, rock and soil types, slide prone areas, and peaty and marshy
ground can be easily identifi ed from the study of aerial photographs. Other information such as
whether the reservoir areas contain construction material for the dam and appurtenant structures
can also be obtained from aerial photographic interpretation followed by fi eld observations.
15.5 RESERVOIR CAPACITY AND RESERVOIR LIFE
The volume of water that a reservoir can hold is known as the reservoir capacity. It is calculated
from the reservoir cover and depth and expressed in hectare metre; 1 hectare metre (ha m) =
10,000 m3 (base 100 m length × 100 m width × water column 1 m high). The reservoir capacity
varies with deposition of silt from the catchment area and the rate of siltation is measured
following the method as outlined in Section 15.4.3. The reservoir life is the expected number of
years for which the reservoir will be able to hold substantial quantity of water.
The period up to which the reservoir can be used should be decided by factors controlling
the catchment area such as the topography of the catchment area and the nature of soil and rock.
Chapter_15.indd 334 10/18/2012 7:02:20 PM
Reservoirs ● 335
The drainage area covered by the soil and each type of rock is to be considered separately as
their erodibility values will be different. The reservoir life ‘assumed’ in the design very often
differs from the ‘observed’ life of reservoir computed from the rate of siltation after few years.
In some projects, the assumed and observed values differ widely.
Though siltation in a reservoir depends on the morphology, geology, and hydrology of the
drainage area, sediment outf low also has a role in it. A portion of the incoming sediments fl ows
down the dam. This reduces the actual deposit in the reservoir with respect to total intake in the
storage area. As seen from particle study, the silt and clay size particles mostly (95 per cent) remain
in suspension and the outf low is very small compared to sediment deposits. Hence, desiltation
measures are necessary if the infl ow is excessive. It is diffi cult and will be a costly proposition
to remove the silt from the reservoir fl oor by dredging. Sluicing is generally done as a desilting
measure. In this procedure, the outlet gates are opened from time to time and sediments are forced
out at a high speed of water. Desilting basins are constructed adjacent to the reservoirs to allow
settlement of sediments, which reduces the quantity of sediment fl ow to the reservoir.
15.6 SALIENT ASPECTS OF RESERVOIR INVESTIGATION
‘Reservoirs must hold water. Not all of them do, and there are many ways by which water may
be lost. Most of them are geologic or of geology dependence’, observed the veteran engineering
geologist Dr Charles P. Berkey (1950). It can be easily understood that if the reservoir does not
hold water, the very purpose of constructing a dam is defeated. In other words, the reservoir
area must be watertight to prevent escape of water to the downstream valley. Ground saturation
and infi ltration of water through fractures in rock at the initial stage and evaporation during
the summer months account for loss of reservoir water to some extent. Adverse geological
conditions such as presence of faults, cavernous limestone, conglomerate, or highly permeable
stratifi ed rocks may cause enormous leakage from the reservoirs. Geological investigation for
reservoirs is, therefore, directed towards fi nding the prevalence of such conditions and the
possibility of leakage after water is impounded in the reservoir.
15.6.1 Different Possibilities of Reservoir Leakage
There are several instances of leakage from reservoirs related to adverse geological conditions
such as the Dudhawa and Kedar Nala dams in Madhya Pradesh, Nagarjuna Sagar dam in
Andhra Pradesh, and Hirakud dam in Orissa (Appendix A). The following geological attributes
are mainly responsible for leakage of reservoir water:
(i) The reservoir located in karstic or cavernous limestone terrain may become incompetent
to hold water. In karstic region, subterranean channels or tunnels created by solution of
limestone may extend from the storage area down to the adjacent lower valleys threatening
escape of the entire reservoir water (Fig. 15.4). A thorough investigation is, therefore,
necessary to prove the water tightness of a reservoir in karstic limestone.

(ii) Buried channel contains loose sand and silt of very old channel or paleo-river deposits
through which large-scale leakage may take place under reservoir condition. Such channel
deposits occurring in the foundation rock or reservoir periphery and connected to lower
valley may cause excessive leakage under reservoir condition, see Fig. 15.5 (a). The exact
location of the zone is traced by exploratory work and accordingly grouting is done to
seal the leakage path. Walters (1971) has given an account of the presence of epigenetic
gorges (buried valleys) in dam projects from different parts of the world and the leakage
problems faced.
The Moosakhand dam in Uttar Pradesh is an example of facing leakage and uplift
problem below the dam due to the presence of a buried channel fi lled with loose till
material and peat. The affected zone was treated by grouting and providing relief wells. In
three river valley projects of Arunachal Pradesh, geotechnical investigation with the aid
of subsurface exploration revealed the presence of thick deposits of buried channels, see
Fig. 15.5 (b) posing problems of foundation stability of dam and powerhouse and leakage of
water from the reservoirs. After considering different aspects of the geotechnical problems
created by the buried channel, it was planned to consolidate the deposits by grouting
to render these suitable for foundation and arrest leakage (Krishnamurthy, Sinha, and
Bhatia 1992).

(iii) Sedimentary rocks such as conglomerate, breccia, and porous sandstone or
unconsolidated deposits such as boulder and gravel present in the reservoir rims or at the
dam site due to their high permeability may cause large-scale leakage of the reservoir

after fi lling the reservoir and the rock disintegrates creating openings for escape of water.

(iv) Even very hard rocks of a reservoir area affected by fault, shear zones, and extensive
joints may pose problems of leakage. If highly jointed rocks occur in the reservoir rims
and extend to adjacent valleys, they may cause substantial leakage of reservoir water. The
presence of a fault or wide shear zone passing through a dam site or reservoir to lower
valleys leads to a potential danger of leakage. The shattered materials of the shear zone
or the clay gouge of the fault plane are washed away under reservoir condition creating
avenues for water to bypass the fault zones (Fig. 15.7). In Umiam project of Meghalaya,
under storage condition, substantial leakage took place through a narrow zone of fi ssured
quartzite dividing the reservoir from a downstream valley. Grouting in the divide could
not stop the leakage, but after nearly a year, it became negligible because of silt deposition
into the fi ssures of the rock.

(v) The hydraulic gradient or the direction of groundwater movement is also the direction
of possible leakage from the reservoir to the adjacent lower valleys. However, if the
water table in the lower valley is above the FRL, generally there is no danger of reservoir
leakage. The Tenughat reservoir in Bihar is separated from the Bokaro valley by a narrow
ridge, but since the water table of this valley was higher than that of the reservoir, no
leakage took place after reservoir fi lling (Chowdhury 1975).
(vi) The presence of groundwater infl uences the capacity of the reservoir. Caution is to be taken
to differentiate the actual water table from the perched water table that occurs in jointed
rocks overlain by impervious shale. When punctured by a bore hole, the water will rise
above the shale showing the actual water table. Attewell and Farmer (1976) observed that if
the phreatic water at the reservoir periphery after storage is found to be at a higher level than
the FRL, the groundwater will fl ow towards the reservoir increasing its potential capacity.

15.6.2 Problems from Slide and Resultant Sedimentation
In addition to the reasons given in Section 15.6.1, a reservoir may be vulnerable to sedimentation
along with leakage due to the following reasons:
(i) Old landslide or subsidence may be present within the reservoir spread along which further
slide may take place under water-fi lled condition and deposition of the slid material into
the reservoir.
(ii) If any abandoned mine or coal measure remains within the reservoir, it may initiate
subsidence and pose the problem of leakage.
(iii) If residual soil or overburden material of great thickness lies in the reservoir rim, it may
create an avenue for leakage through the periphery.
(iv) In some cases, selection of borrow areas and removal of impervious layer of earth from
the reservoir may expose fractured rocks through which leakage may take place.
(v) Vibration due to blasting in the quarry sites close to reservoir rims may cause the problem
of landslide. The debris thus accumulated in the reservoir rims may also cause the problem
of leakage and sedimentation in the reservoir.
Under the new regime of the reservoir, the water table rises and the soil or detritus covering
the peripheral lands of the reservoir gets saturated, causing instability. This may lead to frequent
creep failures or debris slide from the periphery. If the rim area is rocky but faulted or folded and
possesses old slide scars, these may cause large-scale rock slides. Layered rocks in the peripheral
regions of the reservoir with bedding planes dipping towards the adjacent valleys are liable to
create slides under reservoir condition. Unstable lands in the peripheral region of the reservoir
poses problem of slide into the reservoir and consequent increase in siltation. The slide debris may
also block the path of water fl ow through the spillway and cause failure of dam due to overtopping.
15.6.3 Investigation for Protection of National Assets
The reservoir spread of a proposed dam may have important mineral deposits, rare animals
or birds, monuments of historical interest, and the like, which are of great national interest.
While investigating a reservoir project, it is the fundamental duty of the investigator such as
an engineering geologist to confi rm that no mineral deposit of economic importance is present
within the reservoir area including its peripheral parts. Once the reservoir is full, the mineral
deposit, if any, will remain buried under the reservoir water causing a great loss of national
resource. During reconnaissance or feasibility stage investigation, it is essential to fi nd whether
there is any mineral deposit in the reservoir area so that the planner can take a decision on
the project. The Chandil dam reservoir in Bihar across the river Subarnarekha was allowed to
submerge an abandoned gold mine after providing dykes.
Within the reservoir area of a dam project, there may be sites with buildings of historical
importance. A forest with rare animals, birds, and trees such as a tiger project, a bird sanctuary,
or reserved forest with rare species of plants may exist in the storage area. Sites of archaeological
interest may be also present in the reservoir area. These aspects are to be investigated at the
preliminary stage by reconnaissance so that these sites are either avoided or plans are made to
re-store them, if possible, in a suitable place. The Silent Valley project of Kerala was abandoned
due to the existence of rare birds and plants in the hills within the proposed project area. The
Aswan dam required removal of archaeological treasures to a different site. Several historical
temples near the Nagarjuna Sagar dam in Andhra Pradesh were shifted, piece by piece, to
another place to avoid their submergence by reservoir water.

15.7 PUMPED STORAGE SCHEME WITH CASE STUDY
Development of hydroelectric power by pumped storage scheme is an energy storing system. The
basic concept of the scheme lies in storage of base load energy for later release as premium peaking
power. Where the load demand between day and night fl uctuates to a great extent, this scheme is
found to be attractive. The motor or generator used in this method is such that it can synchronize
rapidly. The main purpose of pumped storage scheme is to meet peak electricity demand.
15.7.1 Basic Aspects
The scheme consists of an upper reservoir and a lower reservoir connected by a water conductor
system and a powerhouse. During the period of low demand, the power generated by power
plants is utilized to pump water of the lower reservoir to the higher one. During peak demand
time, water from the upper reservoir is conveyed through the turbines to generate electricity to
meet the power demand.
The scheme needs 3 kWh pumping energy to generate 2 kWh energy, which may appear
to be uneconomical. However, the economic advantage comes from converting low value,
low cost off-peak energy to high value, high cost peak energy. The following are the main
advantages of the scheme:
(i) It can be operated to full output.
(ii) It can be used for storing surplus power in the upper reservoir.
(iii) It can save fuel by drawing pumping energy from large thermal power plants.
(iv) It imparts fl exibility to the power system.
15.7.2 Investigation for Pumped Storage Scheme
Engineering geological investigation to select sites for different structures of the pumped storage
scheme should satisfy the following engineering, topographical, and geological conditions:
(i) The fundamental need for the successful operation of the pumped storage scheme is
locating the project sites near the existing power plant where peak load demand is to be
met by generating additional power. It is also to be seen that ‘no demand’ or ‘off-peak’
power is available for a long continuous period without failure. Selection of structural
sites of the pumped storage project close to a thermal plant will ensure smooth operation
of the scheme without loss of energy in transmission.
(ii) In the pumped storage scheme, the morphological expression gets prime consideration in
drawing the project scheme. The topographical positions of the upper and lower reservoirs
should be such that suffi cient head is obtained from the level difference of their locations.
Normally, the head will be nearly one-fi fth of the horizontal distance between them. If
the topography provides higher head due to decreasing horizontal distance, the required
storage of water will be less and the size of the tunnel as well as the power plant building
will be reduced. This will reduce the construction cost of the project.
(iii) The other important considerations are the hydrology and geology. There should be
suffi cient water in the reservoirs for 10 hours of peak operation. The data on discharge
of the streams contributing water to the reservoirs and the annual rainfall of the area is
considered in the design of available storage. Geotechnical study should ensure that the
reservoir is watertight so that there is no water loss. Leakage of reservoir water may
bring about failure of the scheme for want of suffi cient water. The sites should preferably
Chapter_15.indd 339 10/18/2012 7:02:20 PM
340 ● Engineering Geology
be located in igneous and metamorphic terrain with hard and compact rock showing no
signifi cant permeability and absence of any weak zone such as fault and shearing. Quarry
sites for suffi cient quantity and suitable quality of construction materials for the structures
should be available in the vicinity.
15.7.3 Case Studies on Pumped Storage Schemes
The pumped storage scheme has been successfully implemented in many places. The following
subsections analyse the implementation of the scheme in two such areas in India.
Kadampari Pumped Storage Scheme in Tamil Nadu
This scheme with an underground powerhouse is under operation since 1987. Prior to
implementing this scheme, the Tamil Nadu grid was to cater to a heavy share of agricultural
load for fi ve hours a day but demand during the rest of the time covering the night was very
low. The pumped storage scheme was then taken up in the Kadampari area with suitable
topography and geology. The reservoirs and other structural sites consist of charnockite and
migmatite gneiss, which are very hard and sound rocks traversed by some steep dipping
joints. The underground powerhouse of the scheme located 200 m below the ground has
generation capacity of 4 × 100 MW power. The power generation was trouble free for three
years but then the project faced an accidental trouble due to fi re in the powerhouse. The
power generation was stopped for some time when abnormal seepage and buckling of power
shaft were observed. The powerhouse was dewatered and suitable rectifi cation measures
adopted.
Purulia Pumped Storage Scheme of West Bengal
In the West Bengal power system, the peak demand is very high but lasts for a short duration
during daytime. The full demand cannot be met during peak time due to shortage of power
whereas there is surplus during the night. The Purulia pumped storage scheme was taken up to
meet this peak demand by utilizing surplus generation from the thermal stations. The scheme
consists of an underground powerhouse of 800 MW capacity with 4 × 200 MW reversible
turbines. The heights of the upper and lower dams are 77 m and 85 m, respectively, and the live
storage capacities of the upper and lower reservoirs are 12.48 million m3 and 11.60 million m3,
respectively. The total length of the water conductor system that includes lined tunnel and steel
penstocks is 850 m (Fig. 15.8).

The project area under the Purulia pumped storage scheme comes within the confi nes of
Ayodhya hills of Chota Nagpur plateau. The scheme utilizes water of the tributaries of River
Subarnarekha. All the structural sites such as dams, reservoirs, tunnels, and powerhouse have
been located in areas with favourable topography and geology, the entire project site being
composed of hard and sound gneissic rocks. The joints in the rocks are tight and in many
places fi lled with quartz–felspathic materials. Rocks occur at the surface or at the subsurface
under shallow cover of overburden as proved from exploratory drill holes. The reservoirs cover
forest areas but without signifi cant inundation of the fl ora. There were no displacements of
the inhabitants and as such environmental degradation as a result of the implementation of the
scheme is avoided (Bagchi 1991).
15.8 PETROLOGICAL STUDY OF SUSPENDED SILTS IN RIVER WATER
The high content of sediments carried through rivers causes problem of rapid fi lling of reservoir.
The rivers of mountainous terrains such as the Himalayas carry high content of sediments
during times of snow melt and rainfall. While the coarse-size materials are taken by traction
load, suffi cient quantity of fi ner sediments such as sand, silt, and clay are taken by suspension.
An estimation of silt fl ow through the river Teesta in Sikkim shows the height of the suspended
particles to be as high as 5148 cubic metres per square kilometre per year. If such high quantity
of suspended sediments passes through the tunnel, it may choke parts of the tunnel obstructing
water movement.
If silts containing abundant minerals of high hardness (> 5 in Mohs scale of hardness) and
fl owing at a high speed are allowed to enter the powerhouse of a hydroelectric project, they may
abrade the penstock pipes and blades of hydro turbines. In the Jaldhaka project of Darjeeling,
Himalayas, excessive silt fl ow of reservoir water not only choked a part of the pressure tunnel,
but also caused abrasion of the turbine to such an extent that it required repairing of the machine,
hampering power generation for a considerable time.
This calls for analyses of the suspended sediments, especially of mountainous areas with
respect to their quantity, particle size, and shape but the main aim is the determination of hardness
of the different sized particles. This can be done from the identifi cation of the minerals in the
sediments by microscopic study and then computing their statistical distribution. Microscopic
analysis and statistical distribution of suspended particles with respect to hardness were carried
out in many Himalayan projects for design purposes (Gangopadhyay 1980). The data was helpful
for adopting measures against heavy infl ow of silt and deciding on material hardness of turbines.
15.8.1 Procedure for Determining Hardness of Particles
Daily samples of suspended silt are collected from the central part of the river section close to
the proposed dam site while routine measurements of river discharge are taken by the engineers.
In the laboratory, the quantity of silt measured each day is recorded in grams per cubic metre
and thus the monthly and annual quantities are obtained. The total quantity of sediments of the
four wet months (June–September) is subjected to mechanical analyses (using standard sieves)
in four size grades (> 0.5 mm, 0.5–0.25 mm, 0.25–0.10 mm, < 0.10 mm). The representative
samples containing 400 to 500 grains of each size grade are taken. The grains are studied under
the microscope to identify the minerals and then computed for hardness H (Mohs scale of
hardness) and classifi ed into four groups:
Group A (H < 5)—muscovite, biotite, chlorite, calcite, and magnetite
Group B (H 5–6.5)—apatite, ambhibolite, pyroxene, ilmenite, hematite, pyrite, and rutile

342 ● Engineering Geology
Group C (H 7)—quartz
Group D (H 7–7.5)—epidote, garnet, tourmaline, zircon, sillimanite, kyanite, and staurolite
15.8.2 Example for Hardness Measurement of River Silt
In the Sindh hydroelectric project in the Western Himalayas, the average quantity of suspended
particles carried by the river per year was measured to be 1320 g/m3, the monthly maximum
being 481 g/m3 (August) and the minimum being 29 g/m3 (December). The percentage weights
for samples of four months (May to October) in different size grades were computed. The
variation found is shown in Table 15.4.

suspended particles of Sindh River

> 0.50 0.1–3
0.5–0.25 1–7
0.25–0.10 28–77
< 0.10 35–70
The statistical count of percentage by number with respect to hardness of silt particles under
different size groups is shown in Table 15.5.

particles of Sindh River (average values of analyses of ten samples)

0.25–0.10 mm 6 17 72 5
< 0.10 mm 8 16 73 3
The study reveals that the maximum number of grains (average 77 per cent) possesses hardness
H in the range 7–7.5 (including quartz grains), having very high abrasive capacity. On an average,
15 per cent grains have medium hardness (5.5–6.5), which can abrade iron easily, and only 8 per
cent of the particles with low hardness of H less than 5 have no deleterious effect. The grains
studied under microscope showed that about 95 per cent of them were of irregular shape with
sharp edges. The overall analyses of the data indicated requirement of adopting measures to
reduce the suspended silt content and save probable damage of the hydro turbines from abrasion.
Modal tests and other studies have revealed that water containing more than 0.2 kg/m3,
particle size of more than 0.25 mm, and mineral hardness of more than 5 will be very harmful.
Smaller particles of less than 0.1 mm may also be harmful depending upon their shape and
hardness. Silt quantity of 0.1 kg/m3 or more may damage the turbine parts depending upon the
total head. If a turbine with a high head and high rpm is allowed to run under low head (less than

It is of practical importance for the engineering geologist to undertake the following studies
of the suspended sediments to understand the magnitude of the problem and make proper
planning to avoid such problems:
(i) Measure the quantity of silt carried by the stream at its catchment area.
(ii) Study the size of the suspended particles, including its angularity.
(iii) Find the hardness of the particles and interpret the results of their effect on the hydro
turbines.
15.9 RESERVOIR-RELATED EARTHQUAKES
Many reservoirs are responsible for causing earthquakes. When a large dam is constructed,
the impounded water exerts pressure on the reservoir fl oor, which may trigger earthquakes.
Such reservoir-induced seismicity (RIS) was fi rst recorded in Quedd Fodda dam in Algeria in
1932. The 221 m-high Hoover dam in the US experienced an earthquake of maximum intensity
M 5 on Richter scale after four years of reservoir fi lling in 1935. The investigation on the
Hoover earthquake indicated that it was of RIS type, the pressure of reservoir water on the fl oor
having a distinct relation with the earthquake activity. Since then, investigation has proved that
earthquakes of different magnitudes have occurred after impoundment of large reservoirs in
different parts of the world (see Section 20.8).
In India, the 104 m-high Koyna dam in Maharashtra experienced RIS of varying magnitudes
from the very start of reservoir fi lling in 1962 and the maximum intensity of 6.3 was felt in
1967. The RIS of Koyna was so destructive that it damaged nearly 80 per cent of buildings in
Koyna town, caused the death of about 200 people, and injured nearly 1500 persons. The tremor
was felt even in Mumbai about 230 km from Koyna.
Presence of faults and segmented rocks in the reservoir area increases the chance of
earthquake (RIS) under water-fi lled condition. In the Koyna reservoir area, igneous rocks have
intruded the parent rocks of older metamorphics. The boundaries of the intrusive body and the
older rocks are affected by a thrust that occurs within a shallow depth (less than 3 km). The
change of pore pressure induced by reservoir water reduced the strength of the rocks leading
to failure along the thrust plane and resulted in earthquake. A network of digital and analogue
seismographs installed at Koyna recorded distinct pattern in the earthquakes induced by the
reservoir. The foreshock and aftershock pattern and the decaying rate of the aftershocks differ
from those in normal earthquakes. It was observed that the intensity of RIS is dependent on the
fl uctuation of water depth in the reservoirs. It increases during the rainy season with increased
rate of fi lling water and decreases during the summer season.
A dam with very deep reservoir basin that can hold large volume of water may also induce
earthquake. Gupta Harsh (1992) after studying the RIS in different large reservoirs of the world
came to the conclusion that any dam with a reservoir depth of more than 85 m has a chance of
causing high-intensity earthquakes and as such the dams (higher than 85 m) should be designed
so that they can withstand earthquake shock up to 6.5 in Richter scale.
The optimum structural set-up is the gravity faulting environment (and not thrust faulting)
when even a relatively meagre water load may act as a triggering effect for RIS. There are
11 large reservoirs in the Himalayan terrain. However, there is no evidence of RIS from any
of these impounded reservoirs. Non-occurrence of RIS in the vicinity of Himalayan reservoirs
is comprehended primarily due to thrust fault environment, which is non-conductive for RIS
(Gupta 1992).

15.10 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF CREATION OF A RESERVOIR
In the construction of a project, the most desirable aspect is to improve the human lives and at
the same time minimize environmental degradation. While dams with reservoir are needed for
multi-purpose benefi ts including power generation, it is very important that environmental study
is undertaken such that the problems related to displacement of the people, loss of forest and farm
land, and ecological imbalance are properly understood at the early stage of project planning.
15.10.1 Salient Aspects of Environmental Changes
The environmental changes caused by the creation of a reservoir are mainly of the following
types:
Morphological change The reservoir water causes downstream degradation by erosional
effect and brings about deterioration of the catchment area enhancing silting of the reservoir
and consequent shortening of its life.
Social change It causes displacement of the population and their old habitats by the
submergence of their lands.
Ecological change It disturbs the harmony of the biological process and imposes biogenic
degradation.
The water of the reservoir due to construction of a dam submerges upstream valley and dries up
the downstream parts to a great extent, obliterating the prevailing conditions. If the reservoir is
located in a narrow and deep valley, it may hold a large quantity of water with less submergence
of lands and less environmental problems. However, it depends on the overall morphology
of the storage area. In general, the larger the dam, the more will be the area covered by the
reservoir involving submergence of agricultural lands and populated villages.
Construction of the reservoir causes deterioration of the soil and rock of its surrounding
areas by saturation of water. It infl uences rapid erosion of the surface soil and porous rock of
catchment area and deposition of the sediments in the reservoir water. The storage of water in a
reservoir upsets the equilibrium of the river by changing discharge characteristics and transport
capacity of sediments including the bed load. Under reservoir condition, the water pressure of
the submerged land and forest gets transmitted partly or wholly to the adjacent catchment area
causing degradation of land, which becomes prone to erosion.
The hydrological regime is changed with creation of the reservoir causing a rise in
groundwater table. This increases seepage of water into the soil and alteration of soil chemistry.
The seeped water by capillary action tends to go up into the soil pores and after evaporation
leaves some incrustations of harmful effect on crop growth. The salt incrustation also prevents
growth of plant roots.
If quarry sites and borrow areas are located in the reservoir periphery instead of inside the
storage area, this may cause easy erosion of the barren surface of the abandoned quarry sites.
It increases sedimentation in the reservoir water. Slide-affected areas around the reservoir are
vulnerable to more erosion. Most of the storage dams are constructed for power generation and
fl ood control, but rapid siltation of the storage area may affect power generation and enhance
the chance of fl ooding of downstream valley. Above all, it affects the people of the area due to
submergence resulting from construction of dam. Hence, in the planning stage, it needs to be
decided whether, after spending huge funds, the construction of the storage dam will be overall
benefi cial or will be detrimental to the people and the environment.
Chapter_15.indd 344 10/18/2012 7:02:21 PM
Reservoirs ● 345
The fauna and fl ora of a land are greatly affected by the spread of reservoir water. There
is a change in the aquatic life too due to turbidity, shortage of organic matter, and dissolved
mineral content. The deep water becomes depleted in oxygen. The downstream part of the dam
is deprived of fertilizing silt, affecting crop production.
The impact is apparent on the people, animals, and plants of the terrain that will be covered
by the dam and reservoir project. Building of a dam requires cutting forest trees and excavation
of hill slopes for construction materials causing ecological disturbances. Construction of the
Idukki dam across the river Periyar in Kerala reduced the forest land and degraded the vegetation
cover with submergence by reservoir water. The Silent Valley project of Kerala was stalled due
to the harmful effect of biosphere reserve.
15.10.2 Measures Taken to Minimize Adverse Environmental Effects
It is necessary to consider whether these environmental effects are adverse to overall benefi ts of
the dam and reservoir project. The following measures are generally adopted or required to be
taken up to minimize the negative environmental effects:
(i) Large dams having chances of causing environmental problems are nowadays given
serious consideration. The environmental effect may be reduced by construction of
small dams and reservoirs. It is agreed that small dams are more cost-effective than
large dams.
(ii) In the catchment area, planting of trees is taken up to arrest soil erosion and prevent
environmental degradation. Afforestation and pasturing reduce ecological imbalance. In
the Dulhasti project of Jammu and Kashmir, Chamera project of Himachal Pradesh, and
Rangit project of Sikkim, a huge number of trees (100 to 500 times the original) were
planted in the catchment area. Such restoration work of the forest resources is a part of
environmental management needed in reservoir projects.
(iii) Reduction of siltation to the reservoir should be aimed so that it does not reduce the
generation capacity of power. Measures towards reducing silting of the reservoir include
plantation, construction of check dams, making contour bunds, benching of the hill face,
and wire-netting of the slide-prone ground slopes. The quarry sites or borrow areas may
be located within the reservoir areas; it will remain under water minimizing the erosion of
the adjacent areas of the reservoir.
(iv) People displaced from the reservoir area are to be rehabilitated by providing them
house and land for irrigation or facilities of job in accordance with their professional
need. In the question of settlement, ‘land for land’ is generally accepted. Lands given
to cultivators should be similar to pre-settlement conditions or at least not of poorer
quality.
The engineering geologist while investigating a reservoir project records the factors of
environmental impact by preparation of a land use map at the preliminary stage of investigation.
The engineers or planners are to consider these factors revealed from the environmental study
before taking decision on the execution of the project. Many environmental measures may
bring about more benefi t to the people by improving the quality of their lives. To achieve this
end, a harmonious development of the hydropower and other benefi ts of the reservoir projects,
maintaining essential ecological processes is necessary.

16.1 INTRODUCTION
Tunnels are constructed to serve various purposes such as transportation of road
or rail traffi c, carrying irrigation water, and sewage conveyance. The main aspects
of discussion in this chapter are the methods of tunnelling in rock and soft ground
and procedure of engineering geological investigation from the stage of selection
of tunnel until the completion of tunnel construction. It highlights the problems in
tunnelling due to adverse geological and structural features and suggests remedial
measures for strengthening the tunnel rocks. The chapter also provides an account of
the tunnelling machineries and their use in relation to rock types. It further delineates
the excavation methods and support systems of tunnels from the estimation of rock
mass quality.
16.2 COMPONENTS AND TYPES OF TUNNELS
A tunnel is a horizontal or slightly inclined passageway excavated through the
subsurface rock or unconsolidated materials and open to ground surface at the
two ends. The shape of a tunnel in cross section varies widely but most tunnels
in India are circular, semicircular, or horseshoe shaped. The roof and fl oor of a
tunnel are termed the crown and invert, respectively, and the two sides are the
tunnel walls. The spring line of a tunnel is the meeting point of the roof arch and
the sides (Fig. 16.1).

convey water from the storage behind a barrage or dam for irrigation purpose. Diversion tunnels
serve the temporary purpose of river diversion for dam construction. Spillway tunnels are
constructed for releasing water from the reservoir. Tunnels are also used for sewage conveyance
or water supply. Numerous water conductor tunnels of all these types are prevalent in India.
Traffi c tunnels These include tunnels used as highways, subways, and railways for
transportation. The 3 km-long Banihal tunnel connecting Jammu and Srinagar is an example of
highway traffi c tunnel constructed in rock. Some of the major cities in India have railway traffi c
tunnels (e.g., Kolkata Metro Railway tunnel) constructed in subsoil to ease the congestion of
traffi c movement by surface transports.
16.3 TUNNELLING THROUGH ROCK
Tunnelling is done in rock or in soil mass. All long tunnels and mining tunnels are driven through
the rocks generally following the normal method of blasting by detonating the charges through
drill holes. Construction of tunnels in rocks may encounter several diffi culties due to geological
hazards related to rock structures such as faults, folds, joints, and shear zones. Engineering
geological investigation is taken up through drilling exploration for evaluating the subsurface
condition to plan and design the tunnel and for checking the rock conditions from the excavation
stage until its successful completion. All these aspects are discussed in this section.
16.3.1 Rock Pressure and Arching Action in a Tunnel
Rock pressure is a combination of fi eld of forces arising because of the weight of rock. Tunnelling
disturbs the equilibrium of these forces and the entire mass of rock or some portion thereof
above the tunnel heading tends to set in motion imposing pressure on the lining or support. The
distributed pattern of the pressure is shown in Fig. 16.4. A low pressure zone is formed in the
close vicinity ‘A’ of the tunnel heading where the rock is disturbed. This is followed by a higher
stress zone at ‘B’ and then the pressure gradually decreases towards ‘C’ where it becomes equal
to the vertical stress that depends on the density and thickness of the rock above the tunnel. This
kind of rock behaviour forming an arch in pressure distribution is known as arching or the arch
action. The magnitude of arching depends on the shape and size of the tunnel at the heading and
various other factors related to properties of rock such as its strength and stratigraphy, density,
and structures, especially the extent of fi ssuring. If the tunnel is driven below the water table,
the rock pressure is increased due to hydrostatic pressure of water. Though the actual value of
the rock pressure is measured by instrumentation, it can also be measured through theoretical
approach.
As already mentioned, the rock pressure in a tunnel at depth is the combination of the fi eld
of forces arising due to the weight of the rock. When a tunnel is excavated, the equilibrium
condition created by these forces is disturbed and

depends upon the magnitude of confi ned stress and

known as pressure relief, which may be slow or

great depth, the pressure release is instantaneous,
causing bursting of rock called popping.
The nature of stratifi cation and structures
such as folds and faults has an important bearing
on the rock pressure at tunnel grade. It has been
observed that arching action is well developed
in horizontally bedded stratifi ed rock and also in
intact igneous and metamorphic rocks. However,
if the rocks are highly fractured or affected by
faults and folds, the rock pressure on tunnel lining
varies with changing rock conditions. While
pre-construction stage engineering geological
investigation is carried out by means of large-scale
Fig. 16.5 Inside view of a tunnel showing geological mapping along the tunnel alignment,

or rock pressure evaluating the structural condition at tunnel grade.
16.3.2 Effect of Bedded Rocks on Tunnel Lining
Geotechnical evaluation of rock condition at depth and predicted rock pressure on the tunnel
heading are very important at the planning stage for consideration of the data in the design of
structure. The following are the schematic descriptions of the behaviour of rock mass and rock
pressures on the tunnel lining or support because of the varying conditions of stratifi cation and
rock structures:
(i) In case of a tunnel passing through horizontal or low dipping beds, there will be uniform
vertical pressure on tunnel lining, see Fig. 16.6(a).
(ii) If the bed is vertical dipping and tunnel line perpendicular to strike, the tunnelling will
also experience uniform vertical pressure, see Fig. 16.6(b).
(iii) When the tunnel alignment is parallel to the strike of the vertical dipping strata, there will
be heavy pressure on arch, see Fig. 16.6(c).
(iv) If the tunnel axis is perpendicular to the strike of the dipping strata, the lining will
experience uniform vertical pressure with longitudinal thrust, shown in Fig. 16.6(d).
(v) In case the tunnel is aligned parallel to the strike of dipping beds, there will be pressure
concentration on the sides of tunnel lining, shown in Fig. 16.6(e).
(vi) When the tunnel axis is oblique to the strike and dip of inclined beds, the pressure will be
concentrated on the sides, see Fig. 16.6(f).
From the study of the relation of rock structures and attitudes of the sedimentary beds, it may
be seen that a tunnel aligned perpendicular to strike of the sedimentary beds is comparatively
in a better situation than that aligned parallel or oblique to it. Stratifi ed rocks and foliated
metamorphic rocks (e.g., mica schists) may also act adversely on tunnel lining depending upon
the relation of foliation dip and strike with the tunnel axis. If the tunnel is aligned oblique to the
strike of the foliation, a situation may arise where the main thrust will be on the side resulting
in overbreak or partial collapse of side wall. Tunnelling through schist in Jaldhaka project in
Darjeeling Himalayan region experienced this type of overbreaks because of foliation strike of
schist being oblique to tunnel alignment and dip sidewise.

16.3.3 Effect of a Fault Traversing a Tunnel
A fault traversing a tunnel as shown in Fig. 16.7(a) has the following effects on a tunnel
depending upon its location:
(i) If a tunnel is in the hanging wall of a fault, as shown in Fig. 16.7(b), it should be located
away from the hanging wall side of the fault as far as practicable to avoid the offshoots of
fault. If it is a reverse fault, the hanging wall block containing the tunnel moves, which is
an unfavourable condition.
(ii) When a tunnel is in the foot wall of a fault, as shown in Fig. 16.7(c), in a normal fault, the
foot wall block is subjected to movement. This position at the foot wall block is the worst
scenario for tunnel driving.
(iii) When the tunnel alignment traverses perpendicular to the trend of the fault as shown
Fig. 16.7(d), the zone of intersection of the tunnel and fault will cause problems, but this
situation is better than the tunnel aligned oblique to the fault.
(iv) When the tunnel traverses oblique to the fault, it will meet a thicker zone of crushed rock,
as shown in Fig. 16.7(e). It is necessary to take the tunnel through the position where
the width of the fault zone is of minimum thickness, even by giving a kink to the tunnel
alignment, if needed.
In all the cases of a tunnel traversing a fault, it is to be seen whether it is an active fault,
which is always an unfavourable feature for tunnelling. An alignment for tunnel should be so
chosen that it does not run along the fault zone. If a tunnel cuts the fault, the crushed rock and
the gouge of fault zone will cause serious damage to the lining. A low angle fault (thrust) is
the most damaging feature for the tunnel. The pressure of water fl owing through the fault zone
might cause overbreak and even collapse of the tunnel structure. The clayey gouge may swell
with soaking of water and exert pressure on tunnel heading to cause deformation of rocks.

In case of an active fault traversing a tunnel, its reactivation causes immense destruction. The
crushed material of a fault zone may fl ow out and deposit the sandy material on the tunnel
fl oor hindering tunnelling progress. Shifting the tunnel alignment or selecting an alternative
alignment away from a fault saves potential hazards that may have to be encountered during
construction of a tunnel traversing a fault.
16.3.4 Effect of Folds on Tunnel Lining
The following are the effects of folds on tunnel lining:
(i) A tunnel will experience intense lateral pressure if it passes through an anticline at the
portal portion with fold axis aligned nearly parallel to tunnel line (Fig. 16.8(a)). There
will be more bending of the anticlines in the upper strata and more joints due to tension
stresses compared to lower strata. As such, it is advisable to locate the tunnel in a deeper
part where the joints will not create problem of tunnelling.
(ii) A tunnel passing through syncline, see Fig. 16.8(b) will experience more lateral pressure in
the middle part away from the portals. If the rocks of a syncline passing through a tunnel
is permeable in nature, surface water may permeate to the tunnel creating problem of
dewatering (draining out water using pumps). The
presence of such folded structure and its demerits
need to be identifi ed during geological investigation
at the planning stage of a tunnel for necessary
drainage arrangement in the design, as it may cause
adverse problems during tunnel excavation.

and structures such as folds or faults may lead to

hill slope. For example, a dipping bed towards the lower valley if traversed by a tunnel at right
angles is likely to be affected by slope failure. In case of horizontal or vertical bed, there may
not be any serious problem if the tunnel line is aligned parallel to it. However, if the strata or
fault planes dip towards the slope or the folded rock with axial dip is inclined towards the slope,
it will lead to the problem of slide, especially after saturation with water.
16.3.5 Rock Cover and Overbreaks in Relation to Joints
The rocks through which tunnels are excavated may be of soft sedimentary types such as shale,
claystone, siltstone, and sandstone, or they may be hard igneous or metamorphic types such
as granite, basalt, gneiss, schist, and charnockite or their weathering products, resulting in soft
unconsolidated material. The rock cover of a tunnel should be differentiated from the zone of
unconsolidated material or overburden present in the topmost parts of most of the tunnels. The
vertical depth from the top of the tunnel up to the tunnel roof minus the thickness of overburden
is the rock cover of a tunnel. The engineers generally consider the entire zone above the tunnel
as the overburden. The thickness of rock cover is an important criterion in geological analysis
of stability of the tunnel. When a tunnel is excavated through insuffi cient rock cover, the entire
thickness of the overlying material may tend to cave in. However, if the tunnel has adequate
cover of intact rock (viz. thickness of cover is more than twice of the tunnel’s diameter or
height), the arch action plays an important role in minimizing the chances of caving.
Tunnelling is to be done as per the size and shape in the design of the tunnel. The contractors
are supposed to restrict excavation up to the design cross section of the tunnel bound by a line
so that the fi nished tunnel has minimum thickness of concrete lining (Fig. 16.9). They may
exceed little and excavate up to only a few centimetres from this line. This line up to which
they are expected to excavate and for which they get paid is known as the pay line. Any break
above this line is not payable, but if the breakage is less than the design line, it is to be excavated
by the contractor without demanding any extra payment. Any extra breakage above the line is
known as overbreak. In general, in hard and massive rocks, the overbreaks are small. The inside
part of the tunnel is provided a smooth surface called lining. The lining reduces the wall surface
roughness and allows smooth fl ow of water.
The attitudes of rock strata and intensity of divisional planes such as joints and their spacing
are considered to be the major reasons for the possible overbreak of tunnels. Study of joints
in hard rock (charnockite) in 2042 m-long Balimela head race tunnel in Orissa has indicated
that where the rocks are traversed by two intersected sets of inclined joints, the spacing is close
(5–30 cm) to very close (< 5 cm) or moderately close (30–100 cm), and tunnelling in these

rocks has experienced the maximum overbreaks. However, where the rocks are traversed by
only one set of joints or where the strike of joints is parallel to tunnel alignment, the spacing
is wide (1–3 m) to very wide (>3 m) causing less overbreaks. Thus, the study on relationship
between overbreaks and spacing led to the conclusion that closer the spacing, more are the
overbreaks, and wider the spacing, less are the overbreaks (Fig. 16.10).

race tunnel in Orissa: vc, very close; c, close; mc, moderately close; w, wide; and vw, very wide (Sinha,
Pradhan, and Singh 1971)
An extensive study on the infl uence of joints in rocks of overbreak in hard rock (granite)
of Idukki power tunnel (Seshagiri 1975) indicated that overbreaks are more associated with
blast holes and not with joints in rock. The overbreaks in rock were classifi ed into three zones
in relation to the intensity of joints. In zones I and II, the joint spacing is more than 1.5 m and
the joints had no contribution in overbreak. The reason for overbreak was attributed to large
numbers of perimeter blast holes beyond the designed limit of the tunnel. Only in zone III,
close-spaced and blocky joints contributed to the overbreak.
16.3.6 Relation of Overbreak with Tunnel Dimensions
Some authors such as Wahlstrom (1948) and Proctor and White (1946) have found the following
relationship between tunnel diameter and extent of overbreak of tunnel rock guided by the
inclination of joint and stratifi ed rock:
(i) In horizontal strata traversed by inclined joints, the overbreak may be up to half the tunnel
diameter.
(ii) In vertical strata with horizontal joints, the overbreak is restricted to one-fourth of the
tunnel diameter.
(iii) In inclined strata traversed by joints at any angle, the caving in of rock is restricted to a
maximum thickness of half the tunnel diameter.
(iv) In highly jointed or crushed rock, the overbreak may extend up to three times the diameter
or three times the sum of height and width of the tunnel.
(v) It is also noticed that pulses due to blasting are not transmitted beyond the distance of
twice the tunnel diameter.
Observation of nearly 100 tunnels by Judd has indicated that ‘the rock types and tunnel sizes
(cross sectional area) have but minor infl uence on the percentage of overbreaks; the construction
procedures apparently are more important in this respect’ (Krynine and Judd 1957). In some of
Chapter_16.indd 355 10/27/2012 12:49:22 PM
356 ● Engineering Geology
the Indian tunnels too, it was observed that maximum overbreak results from excessive charge
in blasting (as in Idukki tunnel rock) and not from geological causes.
According to the thumb rule, the rock cover above the tunnel (excluding overburden) should
be at least twice the diameter in intact rock to prevent collapse of roof. However, it strictly
depends upon the pressure condition at the tunnel. On the rock cover of water conductor
tunnels, the conventional practice is to provide a vertical cover equal to the internal water
pressure or hydrostatic head (H ). Recent trend, however, is to provide less cover (as low as
0.5H) depending on the nature of rock. In Indravati hydroelectric project, Orissa, the 4.3
km-long and 7 m-diameter head race tunnel driven in massive charnockite falls short of ‘twice
the diameter’ rock cover in several long stretches. However, it was observed that a heavy fl ood
discharge passing through the unlined tunnel for 24 hours caused no damage to any part. The
safe rock cover of 0.4H provided according to the design was found to be effective for this tunnel
(Parida 1999). It indicates that a comparatively lower pressure can be accepted in hard rock
terrain. However, it cannot be assumed that it will be so for all projects. A cautious approach is
necessary to decide the safe rock cover for tunnel after considering the rock condition including
rock structures.
16.4 TUNNELLING THROUGH SOFT GROUND
The term soft ground tunnelling is used when the media of tunnelling is unconsolidated deposit
or soil mass. The materials excavated are loose materials termed muck and the tunnelling is
generally done by cutting and providing immediate support, commonly known as cut and
cover method. Unlike rock tunnelling, the problem encountered is related to soil moisture and
swelling pressure, and the main concern is to save the roof from collapse. All these aspects are
discussed in detail in the following subsections.
16.4.1 Type of Material, Imposed Load, and Stability
Soft ground tunnelling is done in unconsolidated overburden materials, either alluvial deposits
or products of decomposed rocks. The deposits include clay, silt, sand, gravel, and pebbles and
are generally an admixture of them. The nature of the ground is the main consideration in soft
ground tunnelling, as excavation through the soft zone may damage the surroundings and lead
to the problem of subsidence in the build-up area. In soft ground tunnelling, the ground should
possess suffi cient stand-up time to provide support to the tunnel. In stiff clay, the stand-up
time is few hours to a day when supports such as timber beams or steel plates are provided.
Tunnelling through unconsolidated deposits such as clayey sand or sandy clay experiences a
stand-up time of few hours, but in loose deposit, it is almost zero.
In tunnelling through the soft ground, the unconsolidated materials above the heading act
like a fl uid. The vertical pressure is equal to the total weight of the material overlying the
tunnel. The horizontal pressure is assumed to be varying between one-third and two-thirds of
the vertical load. The materials of the soft rock tunnelling have very low shearing and tensile
stresses. The pressure on tunnel lining varies with time in increasing orders. The problem
of soft rock tunnelling is more acute if the tunnel passes below the water table. Soft rock
tunnelling below water table experiences constant fl ow of water and frequent overbreaks and
makes it diffi cult to provide support before collapse, that is, within the very short stand-up
time. The constant water fl ow is stopped by use of high power pump or compressed air. In
addition, drainage arrangements are also made to keep the water table below the tunnel fl oor.
Chapter_16.indd 356 10/27/2012 12:49:22 PM
Tunnels ● 357
The stability ratio of soil (Nc) at a depth of Z in soft ground tunnelling is the ratio of effective
soil pressure (Pz) at the depth Z to undrained shear strength of the soil (Su).
Thus, Nc = Pz/Su (16.1)
If Nc is below fi ve, the tunnel is considered safe, but if it is in more than fi ve, immediate support
is necessary. Use of compressed air is most effective in this sort of support (Sengupta 1991).
16.4.2 Method of Soft Ground Tunnelling
In the soft ground composed of loose overburden materials, tunnelling is nowadays done by
conventional machines after strengthening the material by grouting. Heavy machines are now
available for excavation in soft ground as well as in soft rock. If such machines are used for rock
tunnelling, the tunnel section, after each sequence of advance, will require immediate support.
Sometimes, caissons or shafts are sunk from the surface to enter the tunnel level to carry out
the tunnelling work in different segments. The most commonly used methods of soft ground
tunnelling are cut and cover method and shield method.
Cut and cover method is best suited for any kind of soft ground with limited overburden
cover. This method of tunnelling involves the following steps:
• First vertical retaining walls are constructed at the two sides to protect the side walls from
collapse.
• Second, the soil from the intermediate portions of the sided walls is excavated.
• Third, all sides are lined by reinforced concreting to appear like a reinforced cement concrete
(RCC) box.
• Finally, the pit or cut portion remaining above the RCC box is back fi lled by earth and the
road and other pre-existing structures are restored or reconstructed.
At the beginning of the work, retaining walls are embedded in the soil at the two sides. It
is a diffi cult task and is performed following the ‘diaphragm wall technique’. The technique
is the same as that used in a dam site by cutting a slit and backfi lling by suitable material such
as bentonite-mixed concrete or RCC. The other problems are related to the type of soil and
include earth pressure, heaving of fl oor, hydrostatic pressure or piping, and settlement of the
soil at the bottom. These problems are solved by appropriate design for drainage arrangement
and thickness of concrete walls.
The use of shield method is very successful in tunnelling through soft ground at any depth
but the ground should be free from squeezing or swelling type of clay. It facilitates advancement
by full-face excavation. In the shield method of tunnelling, the shield, (a jack powered metallic
body), is used to shape the tunnel profi le. It is driven into the soil in advance to permanent
tunnel lining. The shield looks like a circular box with a cutting edge in the frontal part, which
is driven in the soft ground for a short distance by a hydraulic jack. The rear part of the shield
is equipped with an arrangement to provide iron wire support as the shield advances. The
annular spaces of the supports are immediately fi lled by thick suspension type cement grout
(water:cement 1:1). The entire section is then heavily reinforced, starting from bottom and
moving up towards the roof cover. The shield method of tunnelling is suitable in sandy soil
having stand-up time of about zero, as use of shield facilitates cutting the ground and providing
immediate support by breasting. Operating a shield involves the following approaches:
(i) A shaft is excavated up to tunnel level and then the shield is introduced and operated from
the tunnel level.
Chapter_16.indd 357 10/27/2012 12:49:23 PM
358 ● Engineering Geology
(ii) The stability ratio of soil is kept at Nc = (Pz − Pa)/Su, where Pa is the net air pressure and
Su and Pz stand for undrained shear strength and effective pressure of soil, respectively,
as in Eq. (16.1).
(iii) A tunnel lining is designed to support the load due to overburden pressure. In addition,
it takes care of ‘jacking thrust’ arising from erection of tunnel by pushing of the shield
by jack.
The 16.5 km-long Metro Railway tunnel of Calcutta, the fi rst of its kind in India, is an
example of tunnel construction in soft ground consisting of sandy and silty alluvial deposits.
The cut and cover method was mainly followed, but in some sections shield method was also
used in the excavation (Appendix B.5).
16.5 GEOLOGICAL HAZARDS IN TUNNELLING
In India different types of tunnels were constructed in various parts of the country. Geological
problems faced during tunnelling through several rock types or unconsolidated materials were
many. A description of the main problems is discussed below.
16.5.1 Geological Problems Due to Tunnelling with Indian Examples
The hazards encountered in the construction of a tunnel are not related to the type of the ground
but depends on the geological conditions of the rocks or unconsolidated material of the ground
through which the tunnel passes. The following are the problems generally encountered during
tunnel construction:
(i) Overbreak including chimney formation and wall collapse
(ii) Spalling of tunnel rock
(iii) Flowing ground
(iv) Squeezing and heaving ground
(v) Temperature rise with presence of thermal spring
(vi) Gas fl ow
(vii) Seismic effect
Overbreak It is by far the major type of hazard in tunnel construction. It results
when the tunnel pierces through soft rock or extensively jointed rocks. The chances of
overbreak are more in fractured rock affected by tectonic movement. In the sedimentary
rocks where the rocks are layered and alternated with hard and soft bands, overbreak is
more prolifi c due to differential strength of the rocks and their attitude or confi guration
of the beds. In homogeneous rock free from fractures, the problem is less, but highly
micaceous metamorphic rocks due to their less strength and more fragility (with high
foliation character) are responsible for more overbreaks. Folding and faulting result in
deformation and shattering of rocks. If a tunnel cuts across a fault or shear zone, it may
cause serious overbreak deep inside the crown appearing like a chimney (Fig. 16.11).
Wall collapse is a very common feature in many of the tunnels. This is caused mostly by
unfavourable structure of tunnelling media. If the tunnel is aligned parallel to the strike of
beds or foliation planes, the problem of collapse of wall rock including a part of the roof
becomes more acute. This problem was frequently experienced when tunnelling through
the tectonically disturbed rocks of the Himalayan terrain (Appendix B.3).

Spalling It is the process of splitting of layers of rock from the tunnel wall and roof under saturation
with water for a prolonged period and undergoing some chemical reaction. The sedimentary tuff is
made of argillaceous as well as arenaceous (sandy) materials, the shaley matter being 55 per cent
in the tuff. The slaking characteristics of these matters may cause spalling and squeezing of the
incompetent members after excavation of tunnel. The slaking characters can be known by collecting
samples from surface and drill cores and testing in the laboratory. Heavy supporting is required to
arrest tunnel rocks affected by spalling. Spalling conditions in strong quartzite and squeezing ground
condition in softer phyllite rock were experienced in the Dul Hasti tunnel in Jammu and Kashmir.
Flowing ground Flowing ground condition inside a tunnel is a very adverse geological
situation. Such a situation arises when entrapped water under hydraulic head gushes out
immediately after tunnelling. During rainy season, this problem may become serious with large
fl ow of water through porous rock with water table above the tunnel level. The problem is
aggravated when large quantities of silt and clay fl ow out from tunnel rocks with the water
and deposit the load to choke a part of the tunnel. It creates a situation of repeated mucking,
aggravating and delaying the tunnelling work. Since natural arching cannot be formed in
loose material under fl owing condition, the removal of muck will lead to further problems.
In sedimentary rocks, some thin beds or pockets of loose porous sandstone may cause such
problem of fl owing ground. The approach to tackle the situation would be to allow the muck
to fl ow out of cavity, if required by a small diameter subsidiary tunnel, and to reduce the water
Chapter_16.indd 359 10/27/2012 12:49:23 PM
360 ● Engineering Geology
pressure by maximum drainage. Refrigeration of the impounded water is a good technique to
arrest the fl ow but is yet to be applied in our country.
Tunnelling in the Dul Hasti project was a challenging job where heavy ingress of water
associated with debris fl ow condition prevailed at the contact of the quartzite and phyllite
in several reaches. Even the tunnel boring machine (TBM) got partially buried under heavy
debris making it diffi cult to work. Flowing ground condition stopped work for several
months at Jaldhaka Stage I tunnel. Loose overburden materials and rock gouge from shear
zones fl owed into the tunnel at regular intervals immediately after muck-clearing operation.
Forepoling method was adopted to cross the fl owing ground having several shear zones
(Chowdhury 1971). The Umiam Stage II tunnel in Meghalaya is another instance where
such fl owing ground stopped tunnelling work for several months. The work could start only
after driving a small diameter tunnel from the affected part by the side of the main tunnel
and draining out the water fl ow and clearance of the muck through it in wet season (see
Appendix B.1).
Squeezing and heaving Squeezing and heaving ground condition is encountered when
tunnelling is done in unconsolidated rock or claystone containing deleterious clay minerals.
When soaked with water, the montmorillonite in such soft clay band or unconsolidated
material develop swelling pressure, and a portion of the tunnel wall or roof may squeeze or
heave away making it diffi cult for tunnelling. The squeezing ground condition is prevented
by immediately covering the entire stretch by shotcreting and then providing steel rib
supports capable of holding the distributed load. The cumulative tunnel support required is
governed by the designed stress computed from instrumentation. The use of yielding support
is necessary to tackle conditions of squeezing ground. Severe squeezing and heaving was
observed in Loktak tunnel in Manipur while driving through shales. Steel supports were
twisted and tunnel diameter reduced due to squeezing. Heaving of fl oor was also equally
heavy. Rock bolts and shotcreting were adopted to tackle such adverse geological conditions
(Chowdhury 1996).
Thermal springs Thermal springs may be met in some hilly terrain during rock tunnelling
through very deep parts. This may cause rushing of hot water inside the tunnel leading to
problems in tunnelling. There will be a temperature increase in the deeper parts of underground,
and the heat may be prohibitive for excavation work. In the Kolar gold fi eld, when underground
mining is continued below a depth of 4 km, the popping action (shooting of rock fragments under
pressure) is frequently encountered. The temperature is so high at that depth that excavation
could proceed only after providing air-conditioning facility.
Gas fl ow Gas fl ow is encountered in many tunnels of the world, especially in mining tunnels.
Suffocating gas generated from blasting in the absence of proper ventilation arrangement may
hamper the working in the tunnel. At times, during tunnel boring, there is an accumulation of
poisonous gas from some organic sources such as the peaty bogs or swamps close to tunnel line.
One such gas is methane (marsh gas), which is infl ammable and causes danger to workers by
igniting into fl ame as observed in coal mines but is generally exhausted quickly. Such hazards
can be avoided by providing proper ventilation arrangements to divert the gas to surface by
pipes and blowers. Loktak project of north-eastern India during tunnel construction experienced
natural gas fl ow through the pores of shale from a part of the tunnel, which was, however,
stopped within a short time.
Chapter_16.indd 360 10/27/2012 12:49:23 PM
Tunnels ● 361
Seismic effect Seismic effect causes serous hazards to tunnels. The intensity of earthquakes
that occurred in an area in the past needs to be known to suggest future possibility of ground
movement affecting the tunnel. Seismic zoning map (see the fi gure and table given in Section
20.7.1) gives the status of earthquakes experienced in different parts of India. The most
vulnerable area is the Himalayan terrain where several faults and thrusts are present. Movement
of ground along these planes of tectonic activity due to stress relief may trigger earthquakes.
Most of the major earthquakes in India such as that of Bhuj, Gujarat, in 2001 are generated by
the movement of Indian plate. Even peninsular India, which was so long considered to be a
stable land, has been affected by earthquakes, for example, the Koyna earthquake.
During the investigation on Yamuna hydroelectric project in the Himalayan terrain of Uttar
Pradesh, J.B. Auden (1942) observed that the effect of earthquakes is generally restricted within
the top 30 m of the ground. Hence, if the tunnel grade is constructed suffi ciently below this depth,
the earthquake may not cause serious damage to the tunnel. A tunnel may pass a thrust or major
fault in the extra-peninsular region; the release of accumulated stress brings about movement
along these planes. The intensity of probable earthquake in an area is known from seismic zoning
map and accordingly suitable design is prepared for tunnelling through the terrain.
16.6 DIFFERENT STAGES OF GEOTECHNICAL WORKS FOR TUNNEL
As discussed in the foregoing paragraphs, tunnelling through rocks or unconsolidated materials
undergoes different types of problems. An engineering geologist is required to give guidance as
to how to select the best tunnel alignment and the nature of exploratory works. The engineering
geologist is also required to know about the subsurface condition of the tunnel and several other
geotechnical works for successful tunnelling.
16.6.1 Selection of Tunnel Alignment
The fi rst step in selecting a tunnel alignment is the evaluation of the geomorphology and geology
of the terrain. A straight tunnel is always desirable. If a bend is inevitable, the angle at the turning
should not be less than 120°. However, there should not be any bend near the two portals. The
exit and inlet ends should be in hard rock that is free from fault or subsidence. In most cases,
the alignment for water conductor tunnel in hydroelectric projects is fi xed by the engineers on the
basis of engineering analysis and topography. However, an alternative can be suggested on the
considerations of geology and hydrology. For example, a tunnel alignment selected through rocks
having very low rock pressure and are free from major tectonic and structural disturbances and
devoid of karst, slump, rock slide, and other adverse effects are well accepted by the designer.
If the tunnel alignment passes through a valley or by the side of a hill with insuffi cient rock
cover, the tunnel grade in the valley portion should be depressed to avoid problem of instability. If
the physiography permits, the tunnel should be aligned across the strikes of the bedding or foliation
planes of the rock, as it attributes more stability in tunnelling due to arching action. Aligning
the tunnel parallel to the bedding or foliation brings about the problem of side wall collapse. A
knowledge of the structure and tectonic history of the region helps to anticipate the likely geological
problems to be encountered during tunnel construction. In fact, a correct appraisal of the weak
structural features that may affect safe tunnelling is of utmost importance for design consideration.
After the preliminary selection of the tunnel line, a large scale (say, 1:1000 to 1:2000)
geological map of the terrain covering the tunnel line and its surrounding areas is prepared.
This map should have contours at close intervals to facilitate drawing of ground profi le along
Chapter_16.indd 361 10/27/2012 12:49:23 PM
362 ● Engineering Geology
the tunnel line. It is, however, desirable that the cross section of the ground along the tunnel
alignment is prepared by actual topographical survey. In general, the engineers prepare this
section plotting the height and length of the section in different scales, but to facilitate geological
plotting, the scale in both the directions should be the same. With the help of a geological map
along and around the tunnel alignment, a geological section is drawn by projecting the various
strata and other features to the tunnel grade in the ground profi le (Fig. 16.12).

Fig. 16.12 Tentative geological section along the Pandoh Baggi tunnel in Himachal Pradesh
showing different rock formations including overburden at the tunnel grade (Tiku 1971)
For presenting the correct geology of igneous and metamorphic terrains in the tunnel grade,
knowledge of the rock types and structural features at depth is necessary. In the geological section,
the tunnel grade will be clearly marked by a single or double line, and the rock type and structural
features to be obtained at depth up to the tunnel grade and below will be shown. Further demarcation
is made for fresh rock, weathered rocks, and overburden consisting of soil or loose sandy materials
of the topmost part, if present. This clearly brings out the width of the fresh rock above the tunnel
crown, which is a very important criterion in the interpretation of tunnelling condition.
At the early stage investigation for selecting tunnel alignment, care should be taken to ensure
that no mineral deposit of economic value is affected by tunnel construction. If any monument
of archaeological or historical importance exists over the tunnel alignment, the safety of the
structure is to be ensured. While investigating an earthquake prone area, thorough analysis
is required on the ‘seismic zone’ depending upon earlier shocks, especially if it is in the
Himalayan terrain. Accordingly, the designs of the tunnel would include the necessary safety
factor to safeguard the tunnel from any damage due earthquake tremors.
16.6.2 Subsurface Exploration
Subsurface data of rock conditions derived from exploratory work at the tunnel level of tunnel
alignment is necessary to meet the design requirement instead of depending on geological
interpretation. Once the study of surface geological study is completed, exploratory work by
Chapter_16.indd 362 10/27/2012 12:49:23 PM
Tunnels ● 363
means of drill holes and drifts along the tunnel alignment is taken up to obtain knowledge of
the subsurface geology. The number and locations of drill holes are so chosen that these provide
data on the rock types, presence of fault and fold, extent of fracturing at depth, and other
adverse features at depth anticipated from surface mapping.
Angle drill holes are necessary to prove the extent of weak zone at depth due to vertical
dipping fault traced from surface geology. The locations of such drill holes including their
inclinations and directions of boring are precisely fi xed so as to cut across the anticipated
adverse structures such as fault at tunnel grade. The drill holes will be extended up to tunnel
grade rock and depths further than 6 m. In case the tunnel grade occurs at a very deep part, only
a few holes will be drilled up to 10 m in fresh rock to understand the overburden thickness and
rock types at depth. Horizontal holes are also drilled from valley slopes if the tunnel passes at
a short distance.
Water percolation test (pumping tests) is conducted through each drill hole to understand
the permeability of rocks due to porous characters, fracture opening, shearing, and shattering.
Many of the drill holes are maintained to use as piezometers for measuring groundwater levels
for knowledge of fl uctuations in the water table in different seasons. A graphic presentation
of the percolation test data is given with drill core logs (Section 11.7, Fig. 11.22), and the
groundwater table is marked by a line in the geological section to help design the tunnel and
construction approach.
In some projects, geophysical survey, especially by seismic refraction method, is carried
out to understand the subsurface geology. A hole needs to be drilled to prove the nature of
anomaly detected from geophysical study. Geophysical survey is especially important to detect
the anticipated presence of fault or other weak zones along the tunnel alignment, which may be
hidden under overburden.
The exploratory programme of a tunnel project also includes excavation of few drifts close
to the inlet and outlet portals of the tunnel or any other place as necessary to obtain geological
details. The test drifts facilitate a view of the rock condition with respect to its nature and structural
attitudes and degree of weathering in the subsurface. If the tunnel passes through great depth
limiting the drilling to only few holes, drift is taken up from valley fl oor and extended up to tunnel
grade, which facilitates visual observation of the rock condition at tunnel grade. A drift may also
act as an adit for movement of machineries in the construction time. A log of the test drift presents
schematically the rock types, their attitudes, and all other geological features observed.
The core samples of rock obtained from drilling or those collected from the drifts are tested
in the laboratory to determine their density, strength, porosity, and other engineering properties.
In case of unconsolidated material or clay, it is necessary to test for swelling properties and
clay minerals (e.g., montmorillonite) that causes overbreak under saturated condition. The
frequency of joints, the attitude of rocks, the nature of weathering, and similar geological data
obtained from the study of drill holes and drifts provide important information on the expected
overbreaks and other possible hazards. The subsurface information obtained from drill core
logs and the laboratory test data is necessary for design of the tunnel.
Use of borehole camera for borehole photography helps to understand the nature of jointing
and other adverse geological features at depth and to design the tunnel support. In all large
tunnels, especially those passing through faults and thrusts, behaviour of stress is measured by
inserting extensometers or other stress-measuring instruments in the tunnel grade rock through
the drill holes at the planning stage investigation. The quantitative evaluation of the rock load in
tunnel is measured by installing load cells in appropriate place. Flat jack is a simple instrument

364 ● Engineering Geology
used for measuring the in situ elastic modulus of tunnel rock. The deformation of rock that takes
place by applying pressure through jack can be directly recorded for use in the design of tunnel.
16.6.3 Construction Stage Work: Three-dimensional Tunnel Logging
In the construction stage, the most important work is the mapping or plotting of the geological
features inside the tunnel covering the two walls and arch section and is known as tunnel
logging or three-dimensional (3D) log of tunnel. The work includes plotting of the rock types
and structural features such as dip and strike of beds, foliation planes, joints, faults, clay gouge,
fold, shear zones, and seepage observed after tunnel boring. In general, the rock faces in the
two side walls and the arch sections inside the tunnel is mapped by tape and compass and the
data plotted in a plan.
The plan for tunnel logging is prepared as shown in Fig. 16.13(a) where the portion a–a′
represents the fl oor, a–b and a′–b′ the two walls, b–c and b′–c the half arch sections, and o–o′
the central line showing distances at intervals of 3 m. In the plot, a dipping bed (DB) in the
tunnel arch (portion c–b and c–b′) will appear curved in the plan, but a vertical bed (VB) will
appear straight. A folded cut-out of this plan will provide a 3D appearance of a tunnel when
the two ends c and c are joined together, keeping a–b and a′–b′ standing in vertical position on
the fl oor a–a′. Figure 16.13(b) shows the 3D tunnel log prepared from plotting geological and
structural features of tunnel rocks on such a plan. Figure 16.14 shows the 3D geological log of
a part of the head race tunnel in Maneri Bhali hydroelectric project of Uttar Pradesh.
During tunnel logging, while using any magnetic instrument such as a compass for plotting
the rock attitudes, it is to be ensured that there are no iron materials that will distort the data.
The presentation of the data may be done in different ways. The tunnel log (scale 1:100 to
1:200) shows the geological features of the roof and the two walls of the tunnel. Tunnel logging
should be done with the progress of tunnelling, preferably immediately after excavation and
mucking of certain parts, and should not be done after the completion of the entire tunnel.
In some tunnels, shotcreting and bolting are necessary immediately after excavation before
muck removal. In such cases, ‘face logging’ is done after each blast and a composite map is
prepared on the basis of these face logs later on. The tunnel log (or the map of tunnel interior)
thus prepared is helpful to decide on the required tunnel support, lining, and treatment of weak
zones. The geological report along with the tunnel log and associated diagrams helps to take up
these remedial measures.

16.6.4 Other Geological Activities of Tunnel Work
In addition to tunnel logging, the other engineering geological activities at the construction
stage are related to the following aspects:
(a) A clear appraisal is given to the engineers on the exact position and dimension of the
weak zones (due to fault, shearing, fracturing, etc.) that present a threat of overbreak and
require remedial measures. In a folded rock, joints and fractures may be intense where
strengthening of rock by grouting or shotcreting is to be taken up as remedial measure.
At places, rock bolting may also be required, especially where hard rocks form detached
blocks due to joints and faults. RCC lining is provided in extensively jointed rock.
(b) The construction stage work also ascertains whether support is to be provided, whether it is
of immediate requirement, and the portion of tunnel section (with respect to distance from
inlet portal) where support is needed. The geologist should also suggest the type of support
to be provided. Immediate support is necessary to prevent danger of heavy overbreaks or
roof collapse where soft seams, clay gouge, and squeezing ground are detected during tunnel
logging. Load test in such section decides the actual weight the supports can withstand.
(c) In some cases, sudden infl ow of water with silt and mud water may halt tunnel excavation. In
such cases, the geologist should suggest ways to tackle the situation. In general, use of high-
power pump may decrease the water fl ow if the water (perched water) is trapped in some porous
rock zone, but in case of groundwater fl ow it is diffi cult to deplete the water table. A small
diameter pilot tunnel may divert the water. In the dry season, however, the fl ow diminishes or
completely stops when the silt can be removed and tunnel boring work continued.
(d) In many tunnel projects, the conditions of the portals at the two ends of the tunnel require
special study because of their vulnerability to complete collapse due to insuffi cient rock
cover. The method of cut and cover by reinforced concrete is adopted for weak portal rocks.
(e) Tunnelling in rock suggests that a circular tunnel should have a minimum rock cover of
twice the tunnel diameter. In a horseshoe tunnel, the minimum rock cover should be three
times the sum of the width and height of the tunnel to avoid or minimize the chance of
complete roof collapse.

16.7 CONVENTIONAL METHODS AND MACHINERIES USED IN TUNNELLING
In the seventeenth century, gun powder was used for tunnel construction in India. The nineteenth
century saw the use of dynamite for rock blasting by mechanical drills with tungsten carbide
bits. Normally, jacks or wagon drills are used for boring holes for blasting. A self-propelled
jumbo provided with ladder for drilling and safety cover for the driller is used for accurate
drilling of blast holes. The jumbo moves to the heading of the tunnel and drills several holes in
the rock as per designed pattern. The pattern and depths of the holes may vary depending on the
dimension of the tunnel and type of rock, but a typical hole is about 3 m deep and only a few
centimetres in diameter (Fig. 16.15).

hydroelectric project (Kodkade 1971)
After completing drill holes, the next step is packing explosives into the holes and detonating
the charges. The mucking operation is then undertaken by laying trolley lines or by dumpers.

are also used in the mucking. The process of drilling, blasting, and mucking is repeated and
thus the tunnel advances. With advances of tunnel, permanent concrete lining and supports are
provided wherever necessary (e.g., zones of jointed and fractured rocks).
16.7.1 Conventional Method of Tunnelling by Tunnel Boring Machine
The conventional drilling and blasting method is commonly followed in small diameter tunnel
driving in rocks but a TBM is deployed to excavate large diameter tunnels with circular cross
sections. Considerable speed and economy are experienced in tunnelling nowadays by use of TBMs.
A typical TBM is circular in cross section and can be used in boring both hard and soft rocks in
tunnels of varying dimensions, even as large as 15 m diameter. This machine can cut smooth tunnel
walls with limited disturbances to the surrounding rocks and thus helps in reducing the cost of lining.
TBM is an expensive machine but for a large diameter and long tunnel, the overall cost of using
this machine is less than tunnelling by conventional method of drilling and blasting. The Dul Hasti
hydroelectric project of Jammu and Kashmir deployed this machine for full-face tunnel boring in the
excavation of 6.8 km-long tunnel some decades back. The large diameter circular-shaped head race
tunnel of Parbati hydroelectric project of Himachal Pradesh was also bored by a TBM.
16.7.2 Tunnelling by Road Header Machine
Another machine used in tunnelling is the road header, which, in contrast to TBM, can cut
variable-shaped tunnels and not only circular tunnel section. This machine has been found
advantageous and convenient to operate in tunnelling through moderately hard rocks of
compression strength less than 140 MPs to soft rocks for a limited length of less than 2 km.
The basic cutting tool for a road header is a large milling head mounted on a boom, which
in turn is mounted on tracks or within a shield (Fig. 16.16). Unlike TBM, the operation of
road header does not require drill and blast for excavation. This has been used in Subansiri
hydroelectric project of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. In view of the proximity of the four
tunnels to each other, blasting was not possible in this project as it might have developed cracks
in the rock (Siwalik sandstone). Instead, the road header was used for cutting in the entire
operation. Deployment of heavy-duty road header improved the production though it generated
lot of dust, which necessitated the use of foam for dust depression.

16.7.3 Shield Method of Tunnel Excavation
Shield, which is used for tunnelling in unconsolidated material, is also suitable to operate in
very soft rock. Tunnel with soft rock (up to 4 in Mohs scale of hardness) can be excavated by
Chapter_16.indd 367 10/27/2012 12:49:24 PM
368 ● Engineering Geology
an electrically operated mole. In a mole, a powered hydraulic jack holds the frame of the boring
machine in position when a second set of powerful jacks push a rotating disc (cutting tool)
against the rock face. The rotating disc cuts the end and crushes the soft rocks into bits. The
crushed material including clayey muck is carried by a conveyor belt and taken out by trains of
mining cars. Sometimes, buckets carrying the material are lifted and taken out through shafts
operated under pulley system. In large-diameter tunnels, mucking is done by means of dumpers
with rubber tyres and overhead loaders.
Many mechanized excavation methods have been developed by specialized manufacturers
in the US and Europe. ‘Jet piercing plasma joint, laser beam and electron beams method used
in western countries have good prospects in shattering tunnel rocks Under mechanical method,
fl uid erosion, ultrasonic and abrasion were expected to show promise. Nuclear energy for mass
excavation with no muck to handle, due to crater of ditch formation, is also heard of but its
use in open excavation is yet to be demonstrated,’ observed Murti (1971). The position has not
changed yet, even after so many decades of his observation.
16.8 EXCAVATION METHODS OF ROCK TUNNELLING AND SUPPORT SYSTEM
The excavation for tunnelling in rock is aimed at bringing about the exact shape of the tunnel
as in the design. The tunnelling is carried out by forward increment in excavation consisting of
drilling, blasting, ventilating, mucking, and installing the support. The time taken (in hours) to
complete a round represents a cycle. The rock types including the structural features decide the
extent of time or cycle necessary to install the support before the next round begins.
16.8.1 Full-Face, Top Heading and Bench, Side Drift and Multiple Drift Methods
The methods followed in tunnel excavation include full-face, top heading and bench, side drift,
and multiple drift methods. All these methods involve blasting, which is preceded by drilling a
set of holes (called blast holes) used for detonating purposes and fi lling them with infl ammable
substance. In full-face method, the entire face is blasted in one operation. It is most suitable
for strong ground or smaller tunnels. In general, this method is followed in hard and in small-
diameter tunnels. After completion of excavation, reinforcement by bolting and shotcreting is
provided to the crown. Rock tunnels, especially large-diameter tunnels comprising stratifi ed
rock, or blocky and jointed rocks are constructed by top heading and bench method.
The top heading and bench method can be operated by excavating side drift or multiple
drifts. The sequence of work involved in the top heading and bench method, shown in
Fig. 16.17(a) includes drilling in the top two-thirds of the tunnel, loading of explosives, and
properly detonating the rock to achieve suffi cient breakage of excavated materials with minimum
damage to surrounding rock. The tunnel is then ventilated to remove the gases generated from
the explosion. Thereafter, the crown area is reinforced with shotcreting or rock bolting. The
procedure for bench is taken up with the same sequence of work as in top heading. The centre
portion of the lower one-third of the tunnel is drilled, blasted, mucked out, and then bolted
or shotcreted for supporting the tunnel rocks. In the Malaprabha tunnel in Mysore, 41 holes
were drilled in the top heading and 27 holes in the bench operation. Using gelatine (60–80%
strength), blasting was done electrically with the help of electric delay detonators. Normal pull
achieved was 1.5 m to 3.0 m. For 1.5 m pull, 60 kg gelatine blasted 71 m3 of rock.
Large tunnels with poor-quality rock use the drift methods. In the side drift method, drifts
are driven fi rst in the two sides of the tunnel section providing supports, see Fig. 16.17(b).
Chapter_16.indd 368 10/27/2012 12:49:24 PM
Tunnels ● 369
Then, the middle section is excavated keeping the end supports intact. In the multiple drift
method, tunnelling is done by driving several drifts, see Fig. 16.17(c). The side drift or multiple
drift method of tunnelling is adopted in stiff or hard cohesive soil and well-consolidated soil.
Initial shotcrete support is needed immediately after each round of drift excavation. Systematic
reinforcement (welded wire fabric or fi bres) is provided by a ring closure behind the excavation
for stabilization of weak tunnelling media.

370 ● Engineering Geology
A typical sequence of tunnelling in rock includes drilling and blasting, mucking of the detached
rocks, supporting the rock, and lining with concrete. The drilling and blasting pattern of rock is
designed depending upon the rock condition and their structure. The number of drill holes and
the distribution of charge density are adjusted to suit the geological condition of tunnel rock. In
some large diameter tunnels, initially a small cavity (pilot tunnel) is made up to the crown to
facilitate observation of the rock condition. According to the rock condition, drilling and blasting
are continued to widen the cavity until the design dimension is achieved. The 9.75 m-diameter
tunnel in Lower Sileru tunnel in Andhra Pradesh was excavated by this method.
In general, tunnelling is done from two faces, namely the intake and exit ends, but in long
tunnels, the intermediate part is approached by an adit or shaft and the tunnel work is continued
from additional faces. The pattern of drilling and blasting is planned to keep the vibration at the
minimum to prevent overbreak at the rim of the tunnel. After each blast, ventilation is provided
by blower fans that remove the foul gases by suction through pipes leading to the upper end of a
shaft or to the exit outlet and fresh air is allowed to enter. This is followed by mucking operation
by carts and dumpers. One cycle of blasting and mucking takes generally about ten hours, which
includes four hours for drilling, half an hour for blasting, half an hour for ventilation, and fi ve
hours for mucking. Figure 16.18 is a view of a tunnel at the construction stage showing pipe used
for ventilation that extends out to portal end for sucking out foul gases from inside after each blast
and for entry of fresh air. The dumper at the front is used to remove the muck from the tunnel.

stage showing pipe used for ventilation
16.8.2 Types of Tunnel Supports Including Rock Bolting
A support is necessary in a newly excavated tunnel portion to keep the opening stable and avert
any collapse of roof or tunnel wall. This installed initial support system is important for safe
tunnelling until lining is provided. The conventional supports provided in a tunnel can be one
or more combination of the following types:
(i) Timber planking
(ii) Steel ribs
(iii) Steel ribs with pre-cast or cast-in-site concrete slabs
(iv) Shotcreting with or without wire mesh
(v) Perfobolt with shotcreting
Chapter_16.indd 370 10/27/2012 12:49:24 PM
Tunnels ● 371
(vi) Forepoling
(vii) Rock bolting
The type of support provided depends on the size of the tunnel cavity, geological condition
of rock, measured or anticipated rock load, and water fl ow conditions. In adverse condition of
tunnel rock, timber planks or steel rib supports are provided immediately after tunnel driving
to avoid any overbreak, see Fig. 16.19 (a). In general, the supports are kept permanently. If the
tunnel rock is not very weak, the supports by timber logs or steel ribs may be of temporary
nature until the rock becomes stable when the supports are removed and concrete lining is
provided. The steel rib support is very common and may be taken up alone or in combination
with concrete lining of tunnel interior and fi lling of the caved space between rock and the
support by rubble or concrete, see Fig. 16.19 (b).
(a) (b)
Fig. 16.19 Tunnel supports: (a) sequences (I, II, and III) of
erecting steel ribs in jointed rocks and; (b) complete face of
a tunnel with steel rib support and concrete lining
Supporting the rock by shotcreting is done in many tunnels for arresting the overbreak when
the rocks are extensively jointed, having a tendency to collapse immediately. Shotcreting is
the process of concrete spraying into the place by a nozzle. It is generally of 5–8 cm thickness
and contains some additive with capacity of immediate setting. It prevents cavity formation
in addition to collapse of rock. In case of soft and weak rocks, shotcreting of more thickness
and with wire meshing is provided. Once shotcreting stops the tendency of caving, permanent
support by steel rib is provided to contain the total rock load. Shotcreting can be made without
or with wire mesh or reinforcing fi bres.
Perfobolts are perforated hollow tubes that are fi lled with grout inserted into the drill holes.
The grout is extruded to fi ll the annular space around the tube when a piece of reinforcing rod is
pushed into the grout fi lling the tube. Perfobolt is provided after shotcreting has made it possible
to keep the rock intact. In case of hard rock with blocky joints, perfobolts are successfully used
for retaining the rock by extending the rods several metres inside sound rock.
Forepoling technique consists of providing an umbrella of suitable material (pipes or pointed
rocks) over the reach of the tunnel where fl owing ground condition is noticed or expected.
Typically, these are devices in overlapping arrangement as shown in Fig. 16.20 (a). The aim
of forepoling is to ensure that there is no movement of material above the umbrella during the
removal of muck. The two ends of the forepole rods are supported, one end on steel ribs and
the other on undisturbed muck, ahead of the heading, shown in Fig. 16.20 (b). Steel channels
are also used when the materials of the fl owing ground are clay gouge and sheared materials
without any big rock fragments. In case rock chunks are present, multiple rods or forepoles
are used. Forepoles such as rods or channels provide a complete umbrella over the entire zone

condition as noticed in many tunnels constructed in the Himalayan region (e.g., Jaldhaka tunnel
in West Bengal, Beas tunnel in Himachal Pradesh).

rib support, grouted interior fi nish, and
rock and blocky and seamy rock, but not in crushed rock
reinforcement of jointed rocks by rock bolting
or in swelling rocks.
16.9 PRESSURE TUNNEL AND LINING
Pressure tunnels are subjected to high hydraulic pressure from the interior parts. The pressure of
the rock and that of underground water work in compression before water is allowed to fl ow in
the tunnel. However, when under operation, the hydrostatic pressure inside exceeds that from the
outside. If the rock is hard, it can withstand the hydrostatic pressure developed inside. However, the
tunnel needs watertight lining for smooth fl ow and for resisting the outer pressure. For tight contact
of the lining with rock, cement grouting is to be carried out to seal the fracture openings and voids
of porous rocks. A tighter contact is achieved by injecting cement grout under high pressure into the
interface of lining and rock. Cement grouting behind the lining ensures its elastic interaction with the
rock and uniform distribution of rock pressure on the lining. In the design of the lining for pressure
tunnel, more consideration is given to the interior pressure due to the water fl ow under pressure.
The size and shape of a pressure tunnel are decided depending upon the hydraulic requirement
and the geological condition along the tunnel alignment. The thickness of lining provided is
based on the static load acting on it permanently or temporarily. The permanent load includes
the rock pressure and the mass of the lining itself. The other prolonged temporary pressure
indicates underground water pressure through the rock and inside water pressure when tunnel
Chapter_16.indd 372 10/27/2012 12:49:24 PM
Tunnels ● 373
is in operation. Several other temporary pressures such as the blasting effects, rock creep, and
grouting pressure act for a short time. The tunnel lining is designed in such a way that it has the
capacity to resist the combination of all these loads. The linings are generally provided by plain
cement concrete (PCC) or RCC and combined double layers having concrete outer and inner steel
encase. The pressure tunnels are lined for free and smooth fl owing and for preventing seepage.
If the rock in the water conductor tunnels is soft and erodes easily, RCC or PCC lining
is provided. In general, all pressure tunnels are lined to ensure smooth fl ow of water under
pressure. The concrete lining is provided after removing the timber or steel rib supports after
a certain time gap. The lining work is completed in three stages; fi rst, kerb concreting in two
corners; second, lining the arch and sides; and fi nally the invert is lined. The steel kerb carries
the load of concrete casting until concrete sets against the rock. In case no timber or steel support
is provided, shotcreting will be done immediately after tunnelling and concrete lining will be
undertaken shortly afterwards or simultaneously. The main consideration is that the developed
load may be active if the tunnel passes through a fault, fold, or thrust zones. The actual rock
load due to varying rock formations and structural set-up inside the tunnel is measured by
instrumentation to help design of tunnel lining.
In the tunnel lining, the coarse aggregate material to be used for concrete must be of sound and
durable nature and free from deleterious materials. The maximum size of the aggregate to use for
concrete should be smaller than 37 mm. If coarse aggregate for tunnel is not available from the
nearby rivers, this can be obtained by crushing the tunnel spoils of hard rock to sizes of 25–16 mm
and 16–10 mm sizes. The thickness of lining provided in many of the tunnels varies between 20 cm
and 76 cm. For example, it is 20 cm in the Yamuna tunnel in Uttar Pradesh, 25 cm in Beas–Sutlej
link tunnel, 30 cm in Parambikulam tunnel in Tamil Nadu, and 76 cm in Koyna head race tunnel.
The strength of the concrete used for lining is variable depending upon design requirement. The
concrete used in the Beas tunnel lining has varying strengths of 140, 210, and 280 kg/cm2.
16.10 ROCK MASS QUALITY AND SUPPORT REQUIREMENT
In designing a rock tunnel, the nature of rock mass with respect to its structural features in
addition to its strength is considered. Fault, fold, joints, shear zones, etc. are harmful features of
tunnel rocks. In order to bring stability of the tunnels and save from overbreaks, various types
of supports are designed as detailed in the following paragraphs.
16.10.1 Design Aspects
The design aspect of a tunnel including excavation, lining, and support system depends upon
the quality of the rock mass at the tunnel. Among the various geological factors that control the
quality of rock mass, the following are considered while designing tunnel support:
(i) Open joints, clay fi lling, porous and permeable layers, or foliation planes
(ii) Unfavourable orientation of rock attitudes
(iii) Fault or shear zone or karstic condition
(iv) Swelling type of clay
(v) Build-up of water pressure
(vi) Presence of in-situ stress or deformed rock
The support requirements suggested by Proctor (1971) for hard rock and fi rm rock with
jointing are as follows:
(i) Hard and intact rock—unsupported
(ii) Hard stratifi ed and schistose rock—unsupported
Chapter_16.indd 373 10/27/2012 12:49:24 PM
374 ● Engineering Geology
(iii) Massive, moderately jointed—unsupported in fi rm ground and very fi rm ground and steel
rib support at 3 m interval or shotcrete in arch only in troublesome jointed zone
16.10.2 Rock Load System of Terzaghi for Tunnel Support
In most of the Indian tunnels, rocks are of varied nature and numerous problems are encountered
during tunnelling. The rocks of the Himalayan terrain possess high stress and tunnelling is
always diffi cult. The type of support required in a tunnel is dependent on the overall quality (or
rock mass quality) that includes all weaknesses of rock. Several classifi cations of the rock mass
quality were devised and modifi ed by a number of authors. Terzaghi (1950b) was probably the
fi rst to suggest rock load based simply on geological observation of rock condition (Table 16.2).
The rock load is expressed as a function of tunnel size.

conservative, but it gives a good approximation of the rock and is easy to estimate. Moreover, it
does not consider dip, strike, alteration, and other factors related to the rock conditions. Among
the other classifi cations, the Norwegian Geotechnical Institute (NGI ) classifi cation of Barton,
Lien, and Lunde (1974) and the geomechanics classifi cation of Bieniawski (1974) are used in
many countries including India from the 1980s to determine the rock mass quality and decide
the nature of support requirement for tunnels. Both these methods (see Sections 10.8 and 10.9)
are found to be satisfactory in forecasting the rock load and designing the support system.
16.10.3 Methods of Evaluating Tunnel Support by Tunnel Quality Index and Rock
Mass Ratio Systems
Evaluation of support requirement for a tunnel as suggested in the NGI classifi cation requires
fi rst the estimation of tunnel quality index Q (Table 10.5 of Section 10.8) and then fi nding its

relation with equivalent dimension De of the tunnel from the chart. The value of De is obtained
from the following relation:
De = Excavation span, diameter, or height (m)/Excavation support ratio (ESR)
The ESR values of different excavation types proposed by Barton, Lien, and Lunde (1975)
fall into fi ve categories (A to E) as shown in Table 16.3.

Publication of Barton et al. (1980) provided additional information on the relation of
unsupported spans, roof support pressure, and rock bolt length with tunnel quality index Q and
other parameters as follows:
Maximum unsupported span = 2ESR Q0.4
The length L of rock bolts can be estimated from the relation:
L = 2 + (0.15B/ESR)
where B is the excavation width.
On the basis of the study on case records, the following relation was proposed for rock
pressure on tunnel roof by NGI support system (Grimstad and Barton 1993).

It can be seen from the table that compared to the predicted NGI support pressure, the
measured pressure of CMRS is found to be slightly low in the conservative side.

Lunde (1974) was later updated by Grimstad and Barton (1993). The authors have also

According to Barton, tunnelling revolution has taken place with the development of stainless
steel fi bre reinforced shotcrete (Sfr) to spray in dense, low permeability concrete of 35 to 45
MPa in-situ quality and epoxy-coated and PVC-sleeved triple erosion protection rock bolts. The
Norwegian method of tunnelling (NMT) support now follows the stainless steel fi bre reinforced
shotcrete instead of wire mesh as the use of latter in an irregular excavated tunnel surface
may not achieve regular contact with rock. The support system proposed in the geomechanics
classifi cation of Bieniawski (1974) for horseshoe-shaped tunnel of 10 m width, vertical stress
< 25 Mpa, and depth < 100 m has been presented in Table 16.5.

Barton has suggested the use of the data of Q system for initial support system and
subsequently modifi ed based on observation. Plotting of Q values versus rock mass ratings
(RMR) indicates that both are in conformity, thereby confi rming the classifi cation assessment
of Majumdar (1991). Tilak (1999) after a review of several completed Indian tunnels since
1980 came to the conclusion that the recommendation made on the basis of the two rock
mass classifi cations with respect to support requirement wherever adopted by the project was
found to be benefi cial in terms of cost and time. Consensus of opinion is that it is always
better to take up at least some instrumentation or testing of rock load in the pre-investigation
stage and compare the values computed from the two methods for better confi dence of the
methods.

17.1 INTRODUCTION
A powerhouse may be a surface or an underground construction. In the investigation
of a surface powerhouse of a hydroelectric project, in the fi rst instance, aerial
photographs are studied to fi nd the general topographical and geological features
of the site. Detailed investigation is then followed by visit to the site and large-scale
geological mapping. Investigation of an underground powerhouse is conducted by
exploratory drilling. Geological logging of drill cores and their laboratory testing
for strength properties are the most essential steps to understand the site conditions
of an underground powerhouse. This chapter presents case studies on some Indian
powerhouses and the geological problems encountered during their construction
and the methods suggested to rectify the problems. It also provides guidelines for
selecting a nuclear powerhouse site. In addition, the chapter highlights the problems
of setting up a powerhouse site in the Himalayan terrain.
17.2 DIFFERENT TYPES OF POWERHOUSES AND GENERATION OF
HYDROPOWER
Depending upon the sources of energy, there are three main categories of
powerhouse—hydroelectric, thermal, and nuclear. In hydroelectric powerhouses, it
is the water pressure that drives the turbines. In thermal power plants, fossil fuel
such as coal, natural gas, or oil is used to generate steam for driving the turbines.
The turbines are also driven directly by diesel-run motors for generation of power.
Fissionable materials are used for generation of nuclear power.

382 ● Engineering Geology
17.2.1 Harnessing Hydropower from River Water
Hydropower converts the energy in fl owing river water into electricity. The quantity of electricity
generated is determined by the volume of water fl ow and the amount of head created by the
dam. Head is the height from the turbine in the powerhouse to the water surface of the reservoir.
Some of the advantages of a hydroelectric power scheme are that it is cheap to run, the running
water (fuel) is not exhausted, it does not cause pollution, and the reservoir water that produces
electricity can also be used for fi shing, boating, and tourism.
High dam with large storage capacity reservoir is built to develop the hydropower potential
of a river. The essential structure required for harnessing power from reservoir water is
a powerhouse, which can be located within the body of the dam (Fig. 17.1) or near its toe
(Fig. 17.2). In many hydroelectric power schemes, the powerhouse is sited in the downstream
valley very close to or away from the dam. Depending upon the topographical features, when
the powerhouse is located at a long distance from the dam site, the water from the reservoir is
diverted to the power station through a power channel or a power tunnel. The source of energy
is the work done by the water moving from the reservoir and falling to the powerhouse. The
generation of power depends on the volume of available water and the head (or height) of
falling water from the reservoir level to the power plant.
Full reservoir level
Tail water
level
Fig. 17.1 Powerhouse within the Fig. 17.2 Powerhouse at the toe
dam body of dam
The main device in the powerhouse is the turbine having huge blades that rotate under the
thrust of water. The reservoir water is led through pipes (called penstocks) and then allowed to fall
down to the turbine forcing movement of its blades. A generator attached to the turbine produces
electricity, which is then distributed through transmission lines for domestic and industrial use.
The power potential of a hydroelectric project is calculated as follows (Lewit 1982):
Available power (P) in kilowatt = Q × H × g × effi ciency
where, Q is the discharge in m3/s, H is the head in m, and g is 9.81 m/s2 and effi ciency
depends on the type of the turbine or the total project assessment.
The volume of water available from the reservoir remaining constant, the greater the head the
more will be the power generation. The capacity of system in a powerhouse is expressed by the
terms peak capacity and installed capacity. Peak capacity is the maximum kilowatt capacity with
all power sources available at the time of occurrence of annual peak load in the system less power
requirement at the generating station. Installed capacity is the sum of the name plate ratings of all
generating equipment installed in the system. It is the maximum continuous kilowatt capacity of
Chapter_17.indd 382 10/18/2012 5:23:51 PM
Powerhouses ● 383
the system with all power sources available including thermal, nuclear, and hydro installations.
When no restriction is imposed on the use of electric power, the maximum load in a system in
a year is its peak load measured by actual deliveries at the generating station bus bar. While
calculating the peak load, the losses due to distribution and transmission are not considered.
17.3 SURFACE POWERHOUSE FOR HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
A typical hydropower plant includes a dam, a reservoir, penstocks (pipes), a powerhouse, and
an electrical power substation. The dam stores water and creates the head; penstocks carry
water from the reservoir to turbines inside the powerhouse; and the water rotates the turbines,
which drive the generators that produce electricity. The electricity is then transmitted to a
substation where transformers increase the voltage to allow transmission to homes, businesses,
and factories (Fig. 17.3).

17.3.1 Landform Characteristics of a Surface Powerhouse
A hydroelectric powerhouse may be a surface construction or an underground structure.
The surface powerhouse is located in the immediate downstream part or away from the
dam, depending upon suitable topography where high head is available. In hilly terrain,
many hydroelectric projects involve construction of long tunnels to carry reservoir water to

the powerhouse located in the lower valley to obtain suffi cient head (Fig. 17.5). A surface
powerhouse should preferably be located in a fl at terrain or gentle slope to avoid instability of
the site. The groundwater table should be low. An area with hard and sound rock is favourable
for a powerhouse site where heavy machineries are installed. If the site contains normal soil, the
powerhouse is commonly founded on raft foundation for a medium head hydroelectric project
or on pile foundation for a very large powerhouse. The foundation should be homogeneous and
of monolithic nature.
In the powerhouse site investigation, the main
Forebay geological aspect that needs careful consideration
Offtake
is that no part of the foundation settles due to the
load imposed by the machineries such as turbine
and generator. Settlement of the foundation
causes wear of the turbines. It may also damage
the penstock connection with the power plant.
Another essential point for consideration is the
vibration of the foundation when machines such
as turbines are in operation. In fact, vibration is
responsible for the settlement of soil foundation
and damage of powerhouse walls. The design

head ‘H’ whether suitable rock is present at shallow depth
close to the powerhouse for tying the rods.
17.3.2 Preliminary Site Investigation Including Study of Aerial Photographs
Initially, interpretation of aerial photographs under stereoscope gives a quick three-dimensional
appraisal of the ground features of the area where powerhouse site is to be selected. Study of
aerial photographs along with available geological map of the area helps in the preliminary
selection of probable sites. The sites are then checked by ground observation with respect to
the morphology, drainage pattern, soil or rock conditions, and so forth. The merits and demerits
of the different possible sites are then considered, and accordingly the best possible site from
engineering as well as geological point of view is selected.
The initial work in the selected site includes geological mapping covering the entire portion
of the area where the powerhouse and all ancillary structures are to be located. Since the sites
for the penstock, tail race channel, switchyard, and transformer are closely related to the
powerhouse location, these sites are also covered by preliminary investigation with respect to
their stability while selecting site for the powerhouse. The available rock types, their attitudes,
major joints, and fault and shear zones if present are plotted during mapping. If the area has
hill slope very close to the powerhouse site, the site should be studied with respect to slide
possibility.
A hill slope that involves cutting for founding the powerhouse may lead to problems of rock
fall and debris slide. In case any fault is detected, special care is to be taken to fi nd the thickness
or width of zone affected by crushing and whether any movement has taken place along the

fault plane in recent times. Because of the soft nature of rock in a fault, a change in the design
of the powerhouse layout is desired so that heavy equipment such as turbines does not directly
rest on it. A site with recent activity should be rejected in favour of another site free from such
faults.
17.3.3 Detailed Investigation by Subsurface Exploration
A drilling programme is planned after selection of the site based on geological investigation
and engineering consideration. The plan of drilling generally includes one drill hole in each
of the four corners and one hole each in the locations of each turbine unit. Additional holes
will be required for weak zones due to fault, thrust, intense jointing, and shearing. As a rule,
depths of the drill holes with respect to the foundation grade will be 1.5 times the width of the
powerhouse. If the foundation grade is at a depth of 10 m from ground surface and the width of
the powerhouse is 20 m, the depth of each drill hole should be 45 m. However, in case rock of
uniformly same nature continues at depth (as in igneous rocks such as granite and charnockite),
the depth of the drill holes may be limited to only 10 m in fresh rock. Exploratory drilling will
be done using NX-size diamond core bits to obtain good recovery of rock cores and facilitate
study of joints.
17.3.4 Laboratory Testing of Rocks for Strength Properties
Rock cores obtained from drilling at the powerhouse site are tested for determination of
various engineering properties in the laboratory including triaxial shear strength, compressive
strength, density, absorption, and elastic properties. In soil-covered areas, samplers are attached
with the drilling rod to collect undisturbed soil samples. The soils obtained from the sampler
are used for laboratory determination of shear, cohesion, angle of internal friction, and other
soil properties. Tests for swelling and clay minerals are also to be carried out.
17.3.5 Large-scale Foundation Mapping and Study of Seismicity
A powerhouse foundation should be above the water table. The drill holes may be utilized for
measuring the depth of water table. It is also necessary to fi nd if there is any artesian condition.
In folded strata, the synclinal part creates problem of artesian fl ow. In that case, the position
of the powerhouse may be shifted or treatment is adopted. In the Pong powerhouse in Punjab,
the sand-rock bands showed sub-artesian conditions in the foundation. To obtain relief of the
artesian pressure, several 30 cm-diameter artesian wells at intervals of 15 m were provided
around the powerhouse.
Geological features of the powerhouse are visible after excavation of the site for foundation-
grade rock or soil. At this stage, large-scale (1:100) plane table geological mapping is undertaken
covering each component of the power plant. The rock types, attitudes, and frequency of the
joints, the openness or infi lling material of the joints and fractures, and other weak zones
such as shearing or iron staining, alteration, and kaolinization if present should be clearly
brought out for suitable treatment. The load-bearing capacity of the foundation rock needs
to be determined by conducting tests on certain parts of foundation grade where rock is
apparently weaker (e.g., weathered or partly weathered rock) than the other parts. Ideally, a
powerhouse foundation should be homogeneous and monolithic. Such a condition is rarely
attained. Faults, joints, fractures, and other planes of discontinuities create heterogeneity

in rocks. Consolidation grouting is generally taken up to strengthen and create a monolithic
foundation.
Whether the powerhouse site and its adjoining areas have been affected by any earthquake
in the past is to be studied from the available records and mentioned in the engineering geology
report. The earthquake zone within which the powerhouse site falls is to be mentioned. The
appropriate seismic factor wherever necessary is accordingly incorporated in the design of the
structure.
17.4 INSTANCES OF GEOTECHNICAL PROBLEMS OF SURFACE POWERHOUSE
Geological defects due to weak rocks and adverse structural features of rock formation affect
the stability of powerhouse foundation. In many cases, these defective features are visible only
after exposing the foundation grade. The following presents some instances of such geological
problems actually encountered in some powerhouse projects after foundation excavation and
their solutions.
Powerhouse of Ramganga hydroelectric project of Uttar Pradesh
The powerhouse site consists of sand-rock and clay shale of Siwalik formation. The soft and
fractured rock of the foundation was incompetent to bear the heavy load of the equipment.
The variation in modulus of elasticity of foundation rocks threatened differential settlement.
Moreover, the access of water through the open joints in the rocks posed problem of uplift
pressure. To overcome these problems, the powerhouse was laid on 7 m-to 9 m-thick raft
foundation (Chaturvedi and Mandwal 1978).
Bassi powerhouse of Himachal Pradesh
After excavating to the depth as per the design of powerhouse foundation of Bassi hydroelectric
project, it was found that the rocks (sandstone and claystone) were partially weathered. Going
further down was not practical from the design point of view and it was also uneconomical.
In-situ bearing strength was then determined and it was found that the weathered rock had
suffi cient strength to bear the load. However, the rocks at the foundation grade were segmented
by two cross faults. There was no evidence, however, of any recent movement along the faults.
The crushed zones of the fault were removed up to a depth twice the width and backfi lled with
concrete. Later, the fault zone was grouted to a depth of 6 m by inclined drill holes (45° and
60°). At places where the turbine was directly on the fault zone, the turbine position was shifted
by minor adjustment in the powerhouse layout. The soft claystone band was excavated from the
foundation and backfi lled with concrete. After all these treatments, the powerhouse was laid on
reinforced concrete raft (Srivastava and Sondhi 1978) to provide required stability.
Balimela powerhouse of Orissa
Excavation of this powerhouse site encountered very hard and fresh gneissic rock at the
foundation. The rock was initially considered to be suitable for founding the powerhouse
without any treatment. Detailed geological study, however, indicated that the rocks were
fragmented by several sets of joints that were either open or fi lled by clay material. These clay-
fi lled joints and some shear zones provided heterogeneity to the foundation. Water percolation
test in these jointed rocks showed suffi cient water loss, indicating that the joints were open
at depth and also interconnected. In view of these open joints in the rock, the foundation was
grouted to a depth of 6 m using pressure between 0.5 kg/cm2 and 2.10 kg/cm2 with grout mix

of cement-to-water ratio 1:2 and 1:5. In addition, the 10–30 cm-wide shear zones were treated
by scooping out the soft material up to 50 cm depth and backfi lled by concrete (Sinha, Pradhan,
and Singh 1978).
17.5 UNDERGROUND POWERHOUSE OF A HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
Underground powerhouse for hydroelectric project in India was fi rst constructed in Maithon
project of Damodar Valley Corporation in 1953. Other instances of underground powerhouses
include the Koyna project of Maharashtra, Idukki project of Kerala, and Yamuna (Stage II)
project of Uttar Pradesh constructed in the 1960s. Since then, several underground powerhouses
were constructed for hydroelectric projects in different parts of India.
17.5.1 General Aspects
A stable landmass with outcrops of hard and sound rock mass free from fault, fold, and excessive
joints and without any groundwater problem is ideal for locating underground powerhouse.
Many of the problems encountered are the same as those in the construction of large tunnels in
rock. However, unlike a tunnel, any settlement of the foundation or roof collapse may jeopardize
the very functioning of the powerhouse including generation of power supply and also damage
the machineries. Hence, even a minor geological weakness such as a shear zone in the roof
arch or walls needs to be studied carefully. In the feasibility stage of engineering geological
investigation for underground powerhouse site, as in the case of other engineering structural
sites, study of aerial photographs is taken up in the fi rst instance, followed by surface mapping.
After selecting the site from ground survey, exploratory drilling is taken up.
The underground powerhouse site is explored by several NX-size drill holes. A programme
of exploratory drill holes may be formulated in the same way as explained in connection with
subsurface exploration for surface powerhouse but at least one exploratory drift will be driven
close to the proposed underground chamber. This is necessary for visually examining the rock
condition and conducting instrumental tests, especially for stress measurement. The drift may
also be used to take up drill holes from its rear end so as to penetrate the proposed foundation
grade of the powerhouse.
17.5.2 Special Considerations
The following aspects need special attention in engineering geological investigation of an
underground powerhouse:
(i) Orientation of powerhouse
(ii) Rock stress condition at depth
(iii) Infl uence of faults and joints
(iv) Groundwater condition and water seepage
(v) Excavation method and support system
The dimension and shape of the subsurface cavity affect the stress condition of the
rock. The orientation of the cavity with respect to the structural attitudes of rock infl uences
the stability. The most stable confi guration is achieved when the long axis of the cavity
is kept parallel to the maximum principal stress and perpendicular to the direction of the
main structural feature such as the bedding or foliation strike. The direction and magnitude
Chapter_17.indd 387 10/18/2012 5:23:53 PM
388 ● Engineering Geology
of stress are obtained by over-coring methods. In rocks devoid of any bedding or foliation
structures, the powerhouse cavity may be oriented with the long axis perpendicular or
oblique to the trends of the maximum number of joints. Intact igneous rocks such as granite
and charnockite, volcanic rocks such as massive basalt, or sparsely foliated metamorphic
rocks such as gneiss or horizontally banded massive quartzite are suitable for underground
powerhouse construction.
The stress condition in underground powerhouse rock infl uences overbreaks and collapse
of rock from roof or slide of the wall rocks. The rock pressure at depth on the roof arch of
underground cavity can be estimated following the empirical method of Norwegian Geotechnical
Institute (NGI) or rock mass rating (RMR) system. However, due to the heterogeneity of the rock
mass and irregularity in the shape of the cavities, determination of in-situ stress in powerhouse
rock is highly essential. The test for in-situ stress may be carried out in rock in a drift close to the
proposed foundation grade. The junctions of the powerhouse walls with pressure shafts, draft
tube, and access tunnel are the zones of high concentration of stresses.
Quantitative evaluation of the in-situ stresses is necessary for design consideration.
Extensometers are used to measure the stress in rock at depth through boreholes. The direction
and magnitude of stress are obtained by over-coring methods. Flat jack test or uniaxial jack
test method has been used to measure rock stress in many
Table 17.1 In-situ stress test of rocks in of the projects (Section 10.6). The method of photoelastic
Srisailam underground powerhouse site modelling is applied in assessing the stress condition
in subsurface rock with the help of computer software.

The orientation and spacing of the predominant joints
can be studied from borehole camera through the drill hole used to get subsurface conditions
of rocks of the powerhouse site. The infi lling materials in joints or the fault gouge are the
main harmful factors initiating slide due to their low cohesion and internal friction. Once
the slide takes place, it accentuates further roof collapse. Presence of permeable beds, close-
spaced joints, and fault zones in the foundation rocks provides passages for seepage of water.
If the water table is high, there will be a constant problem of groundwater fl owing into the
cavity. Water pressure in the fractures and fault zone due to seepage of water may cause

Powerhouses ● 389
hydraulic failure of the rock mass of cavity. Pumping test is conducted through drill holes to
determine the nature of permeability of jointed rock. The drill holes also serve as piezometers
for water table.
The conventional approach of tunnel excavation in rocks (Section 16.8), especially by
multiple drift method shown in Fig. 16.17(c), is followed in the excavation of underground
powerhouse. The sequence of excavation generally starts from top heading and then proceeds
downwards to bench and invert (Fig. 17.6). Prior to excavation, the blasting pattern is
designed depending upon the rock condition by making specifi c changes in the distribution
of charges in the periphery. Conventional supports include steel sets and rock bolts followed
by thick concrete lining. In recent times, more preference is given to rock bolting and shotcreting.
If the rock is very hard and sound, it is kept unlined. As in a tunnel, tunnelling quality index
Q and RMR values of rock (Section 16.10) play an important role in deciding the support
system for underground power plants in India with provision of cable anchor wherever required.
Pre-stressed anchoring is done in large underground openings by fi rst drilling holes as per
design angle and pre-grouting them. The cables are then installed and stressed against the
anchorage.

17.6 INSTANCES OF GEOLOGICAL PROBLEMS IN UNDERGROUND POWERHOUSES
The geotechnical problems faced by some underground hydroelectric powerhouses during
construction and post-construction stages and the measures adopted to overcome the diffi culties
of adverse geology are outlined in the following paragraphs based on Tilak (1999).
Powerhouse of Koyna project, Maharashtra
The powerhouse of Koyna hydroelectric project is located underground in the Deccan trap. Due
to horizontal lava fl ow, any orientation of the powerhouse cavity was possible. The powerhouse
Chapter_17.indd 389 10/18/2012 5:23:53 PM
390 ● Engineering Geology
consists of three chambers, namely the machine hall, the valve house, and the transformer hall,
and the span measures 15 m, 6 m, and 12 m, respectively. The machine hall arch encountered a
bole layer that was treated by 3 m to 5 m-deep bolts, introducing each at intervals of 1 m, and
providing 91 cm-thick concrete lining of the wall rock.
Excavation started by a drift towards the roof, which was then widened until the level of the
haunch. The arch portion was then lined by concrete. The remaining portion was then excavated
for benching following pre-split blasting technique. The condition was dry during the entire
excavation. The walls of the chambers were left unlined because of very hard basalt and no
dilation or rock fall was observed.
Powerhouse of Kadamparai project, Tamil Nadu
Kadamparai hydroelectric project with underground powerhouse, the fi rst pumped storage
scheme of India, was completed in 1987 but faced post-construction problems. It has four 400 MW
units 200 m below the ground level. The dimension of the cavity is 129 m × 21 m × 34 m.
Transformer bays are located on both sides of the long axis of the powerhouse. Charnockite and
gneiss are the rock types of the powerhouse site. The three adits, power cable shafts, and access
tunnels are unlined, whereas surge shafts and pressure shafts are lined.
Reinforcement has been provided to the arch portion of the roof of the powerhouse
cavern by means of 5 m-long, 20 mm-diameter expansion shell bolts spaced at 2 m × 2 m
intervals followed by cement grouting to full length. Some cracks developed in the cavern walls
were reinforced with bolting of 5 m to 7 m length followed by 75 mm-thick guniting and chain
link mesh.
After three years of its construction, an accidental fi re took place in the powerhouse that
necessitated plant shutdown. After dewatering, it was found that there were places where linings
were damaged, some plates were missing from the contact, and some pipes were buckled.
The remedial measures adopted include replacing the plates and grouting of the contact zone
between the rocks and the supports.
Powerhouse of Srisailam project, Andhra Pradesh
There are three parallel underground caverns in the Srisailam project for powerhouse, transformer,
and surge chamber, which are separated from one another by 30 m-thick rock pillars. Horizontally-
bedded massive quartzite and siltstone are the rock types of the caverns. The rocks are intersected
by three sets of joints. A fault was detected traversing a part of the powerhouse site but it was
avoided by a little shift of the cavity layout towards downstream. Estimation of the rock quality
indicated an RMR value of 61 and Q value of 25, indicating good condition of rock. Due to the
presence of a shear zone cutting the fl at-bedded rock, the powerhouse cavern experienced some
rock falls. The excavation was done by multiple drifts from roof towards the fl oor.
The supports provided include the following (Tilak 1999):
In the roof arch 9 m-long, 22 mm-diameter rock bolting by staggered holes spaced 3 m ×
1.5 m and 4.8 m-long 22 mm-diameter rock bolt, staggered holes spaced 1.5 × 1.5 m
In the walls 6 m to10 m-long, 25 mm-diameter grouted rock bolts with staggered holes
spaced 2 m × 1.5 m
At the bottom parts 2 m-long, 25 mm-diameter rock anchors drilled 1.5 m in rock spaced
at 2 m intervals
Inside lining of cavity 70 mm thick steel fi bre reinforced shotcrete

17.7 THERMAL POWERHOUSE
Hydroelectric power is not suffi cient to meet the country’s demand of electricity. Hence coal
in addition to diesel and gas based power is also required to meet the need. Of these, low grade
coals available from various coal-fi elds are mainly utilised that have been discussed below.
17.7.1 Basic Needs
A substantial portion of the power demand in India is met by the thermal power produced
mostly by use of low-grade coal as fuel. There are several power stations that use diesel or
natural gas. A thermal powerhouse requires water for cooling the turbines. In the absence of
natural water source such as a lake near the powerhouse site, a dam is constructed to create a
reservoir to supply water to the power plants.
Majority of thermal powerhouses of India are coal based. When the powerhouse is operated
by coal, a regular supply of large quantities of coal should be ensured. Railway facility is
needed for supply of coal from the coal mining areas. In general, low-grade coal with high ash
content is used in the thermal plants. A dumping place or big pit is required for deposition of
large quantities of ash. The ash produced is mixed with water to form slurry, which is poured
into the pit. The place where the ash is dumped should be periodically investigated with respect
to the effect of chemicals (sulphates and sulphurous acid) that may leach out from the ground
to contaminate groundwater, especially during the rainy season. To avoid contamination, large
silos made of concrete are used instead of pits. The ash is picked up from the boilers by vacuum
suction and then the compressed air system will eject the ash into the silos.
When gas is used for the turbines, it requires laying of pipelines for receiving the supply
from the source. The terrain through which the pipelines pass will need geological investigation
to avoid problems of slide and subsidence and this causes interruption in the supply of the fuel
to run the turbine.
17.7.2 Site Investigation by Mapping and Subsurface Drilling
Engineering geology helps in the selection of site for the powerhouse and ancillary structures.
In general, engineers provide some probable sites and the most suitable one from geological
consideration is to be selected. The geological study includes mapping of the area with
special care to reveal the characteristics of the rock with respect to its homogeneity and structures
such as fault and whether there is any recent movement along the fault. Drill holes are taken
up to study the subsurface condition of rock. If the area is covered by soil, details regarding
the thickness and nature of soil are to be determined by drill holes followed by laboratory testing
of soil. Samples are collected by soil exploration for laboratory determination of clay minerals
and swelling property. A swelling type of clay may develop heaving of the foundation, resulting
in crack and settlement of foundation. Drill holes are used for measurement of groundwater
table. An area with high water table is likely to encounter problem of constant dewatering
and needs waterproofi ng treatment at depth. The site should be avoided if the groundwater
always remains higher than the design base of the powerhouse where equipment will be
installed.
A thermal powerhouse requires installation of heavy machineries covering a large area. An
ideal condition for thermal powerhouse is uniform presence of fi rm rock at a depth of 3 m to
4 m under the fl oor at the main powerhouse and also in the areas outside the power plant for
Chapter_17.indd 391 10/18/2012 5:23:53 PM
392 ● Engineering Geology
locating machineries such as fuel oil handling, water treatment plant, and crusher house, where
the maximum strength of the foundation needed is of the order of 10–15 tonnes/m2. Such an
occurrence of rock may rarely be found. Extensive excavation is required for founding the
structure for feed pump and cable gallery and locating cooling water pump at the subsurface
region. If rocks are exposed throughout the area, it will involve blasting of the rock, which is not
only expensive but also a time-consuming process. Engineers, therefore, favour a soil-covered
area rather than a rocky area. According to Nag, Manier, and Reddy (1978), ‘Geological
exploration in that area can help in localizing a site with most favourable foundation conditions
for the power plant itself. Pile foundation is quicker and cheaper than rock foundation except
in unlikely possibility of rock being situated at an uniform depth of about 3 to 4 m below fl oor
level in the plant area.’
Location of many of the ancillary structures such as the ash pump house, hoppers, and
wagon trippers will involve cut and cover to an extent of 12 m to 15 m depth. Excavation in rocks
of such magnitude is observed to be uneconomical, and hence, soil is preferred. The presence
of rock is desired in limited areas near the surface where boiler, precipitator, and chimney are
located. The required bearing strength for the thermal plant foundation is 25–30 tonnes/m2.
Such bearing capacity is generally not expected in soil. Therefore, heavy machineries are
installed in soil-covered areas on pile or raft foundations. Soil of bearing capacity upto
60 tonnes/m2 can be achieved by driving piles. Testing of soil is needed for the actual loading
and for designing the length of the piles. After pile driving, in-situ bearing strength of the soil
is carried out to determine whether the piling has been successful to achieve the design load-
bearing capacity. The raft foundation is taken up in areas where ancillary structures will be
installed.
Foundation for the high-rise chimney is to be explored by drill holes. A rocky base is desirable
for founding the chimney to withstand the high pressure of its own load. Turbodynamos and
motor generator are different from conventional types. Using high-speed turbodynamos
involves foundation problem due to vibratory stress. For the high-speed machine, in-situ
dynamic properties of soil need to be determined in addition to other parameters such as density,
cohesion, angle of internal friction, and Poisson’s ratio for consideration in the foundation
design. To arrest vibration of foundation during the operation of machineries, the powerhouse
structure is to be tied with fi rm bedrock as done in hydropower plants.
17.8 NUCLEAR POWERHOUSE
Nuclear power is necessary to cope with the increasing demand for power. Because of the
danger of harmful radiation from nuclear powerhouse, it is highly essential to locate the plant
structure on stable foundation as well as avoid radiation hazard. Since nuclear powerhouse uses
fi ssionable materials, it requires construction of heavy and massive structure for radioactive
protection.
17.8.1 Guidelines of Atomic Energy Commission on Site Selection
There are several guidelines laid down by the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) of India.
Three of the major criteria are as follows:
(i) The powerhouse should be located about 5 km away from areas of major habitation.
(ii) Source of water capable of continuous supply of about 70–85 m3/s should be available
near the plant site for cooling and fl ashing the waste from fi ssionable material.
Chapter_17.indd 392 10/18/2012 5:23:53 PM
Powerhouses ● 393
(iii) The foundation of the structure should be very rigid without any chance of differential
settlement in the future. It should behave uniformly throughout the long period of the
power plant’s life.
17.8.2 Method of Engineering Geological Investigations
Photogeological studies are taken up in the fi rst instance for selecting suitable site for
founding the structures for nuclear power station keeping in view the necessary guidelines
provided by the AEC. Alternative possibilities in a locality are also recorded from the
photogeological study for further consideration by ground checking. In practice, the area for
locating the atomic power plant is proposed by the AEC team in collaboration with power
plant engineers. The engineering geologist needs to study the area and select the structural
site for founding the machineries. The study includes reconnaissance traverse, recording
of topographical features, geological mapping, logging of drill holes, and identifying
geohydrological conditions.
An important aspect of the study is to ascertain whether the area is affected by any earthquake.
In fact, seismicity is the most important factor in searching the location for a nuclear power
plant as any seismic movement in future will be highly detrimental to the structures of the
power station. Study of aerial photographs helps to determine whether there is any evidence of
recent earthquake movement in the area such as the presence of a fault of recent or sub-recent
age. Evaluation of local and regional stability is another important aspect of geotechnical study.
Regional stability is decided from the tectonic activity, seismic activity, and hydrothermal
activity within a radius of 300 km from the proposed site (Demin and Xun 1982). Based on
the stability of the proposed site, the base of the foundation is located on fi rm ground, or the
structure is designed with suitable seismic coeffi cient.
Once the area is covered by reconnaissance visit, large-scale geological mapping is
undertaken at the possible site for the powerhouse including ancillary structures. Once the site
is fi nally selected or accepted from engineering point of view, exploratory drill holes are taken
up for fi nding the rock condition or nature of soil at depths. The drill holes are used for the
study of groundwater table and also the fl uctuations in groundwater levels. Laboratory tests are
conducted to fi nd the engineering properties of the rock and soil samples. In addition, fi eld load
testing is carried out for the rock after removing the outer weathered zone. This in-situ bearing
strength of rock is necessary for engineering design.
The following conditions should be satisfi ed for a nuclear power station:
(i) The rock should be hard and sound and of homogeneous character without any major
discontinuities.
(ii) The powerhouse site, including its surrounding areas, should be a stable landmass and
should not be affected by any creep, slide, or subsidence.
(iii) There should be no effect of fault movement in the geologically recent or sub-recent
times.
(iv) In case any fault is traced, its effect and whether it is still active should be determined by
installing a seismograph along the fault.
(v) The groundwater table should be low. It must be lower than the powerhouse foundation
during the rainy season.
An ideal area satisfying all these conditions may not be available for locating a nuclear
powerhouse. The geological report brings out all the available topographical, geological, and
hydrological features and wherever needed suggests remedial measures. A homogeneous
Chapter_17.indd 393 10/18/2012 5:23:53 PM
394 ● Engineering Geology
nature of rock foundation is desired for nuclear power station. If soil or soft rock is present
in the powerhouse site, a raft foundation is to be provided for installing nuclear reactors and
other equipment. The isolation or disposal of radioactive waste needs to be done in a very deep
subsurface sound rock such as granite, charnockite, granulite, and basalt, which are available
in many parts of India.
17.8.3 Problems of Site Selection in Himalayan Area
Unlike peninsular India, the geological condition of the extra-peninsular (Himalayan) region
is different, where rocks are affected by thrusts and faults, and earthquakes are frequent. There
are several records of earthquakes of different magnitudes in the Himalayan terrain, causing
displacement along fault planes, sliding, and subsidence of grounds and damage of structures.
In general, the Himalayan areas are prone to seismic tremors.
Study of the foothill areas (Siwaliks) of the Himalayas in search of suitable locations for
nuclear power stations indicated a nature of the same geological and structural set-up in all
the possible sites. The area comprises soft rocks such as sandstone, sand-rock, clay shale, and
boulder conglomerate of Siwalik formation. Sand-rock and clay shale are especially of very
low strength. The bedrocks (Siwaliks) are covered by thick terrace deposits consisting of river-
borne boulders, gravels, and fi nes. The rocks were subjected to movement in geological past
by thrust and fault along which seismic activity might have taken place during recent times. If
any fault and thrust are detected close to the proposed sites, instrumental tests are necessary
to determine their activity with respect to movement in recent to sub-recent (late Pleistocene)
times. There are some tear faults (e.g., Yamuna tear) concealed under the overburden materials
where problem of groundwater will be intense (Hukku et al. 1975).
17.8.4 Problems of Locating an Atomic Power Plant on Alluvium—Case Study
Geotechnical investigation was carried out in parts of the Hissar district of Haryana for locating
an atomic power plant. The investigation focussed on the physiography, geology, geohydrology,
and seismicity of the area. Topographically, the area is nearly a fl at country with some sand
dunes. The average annual rainfall in the area is about 50 cm. The climate is sub-tropical, semi-
arid, and dry. Geologically, the terrain is represented by Indo-Gangetic alluvium and most
parts of the area are covered by thick aeolian deposits. The aeolian deposits are underlain
by Archaean granite and gneiss but the area is devoid of any rock outcrop. Bedrock could be
traced from a well about 250 m below the alluvium. Six holes drilled to a depth of about 60 m
in the area met only alluvium comprising sandy silt, silty clay, stiff (plastic) clay, and kankar.
Standard penetration test through the boreholes indicated presence of stiff clay bed at a depth
of 20 m and extended down to 26 m. The water table was recorded at a depth of 1.6 m to 6 m
from the surface. Laboratory tests indicated sulphate content in groundwater.
From overall consideration of the geology, geohydrology, and stability of the area, it was
recommended that the power plant and ancillary structures should be constructed at a depth
of 20 m providing raft foundation on concrete piles. It was also suggested that a special type
of cement be used for construction purpose as sulphate content in groundwater is detrimental
to ordinary cement concrete. The area falls under IS seismic zone III for which a horizontal
seismic coeffi cient of 0.34g was found to be necessary and was proposed for inclusion in the
design of the structure. Providing an inclination of 1.5 H:1 V to the cut slopes with 3 m-wide
berms at every 8 m-height intervals and arranging proper drainage system were recommended

as remedial measures to arrest potential danger of slope failures. Use of high-power pumps was
suggested for lowering the groundwater table to avoid development of pore water pressure and
heaving below the structural foundation (Mandwal 2005).

18.1 INTRODUCTION
This chapter deals with the geotechnical approach of site selection for a bridge
that depends upon factors such as geomorphic features, foundation conditions,
and available construction materials. In the design of a bridge, it needs to be
ensured that the foundation of the bridge piers can support the static load of the
bridge superstructure and the live load of the moving vehicles or trains. The site
investigation should be made by exploratory drilling to evaluate the subsurface
geological conditions and take decisions on the foundation capability of supporting
materials to bear the design load. Case studies on several bridges have indicated
that the main cause of subsidence of piers and even failure of a bridge is related to
weak foundation. The chapter suggests the measures to be taken to strengthen the
foundation.
18.2 BASICS OF A BRIDGE
The engineering structure of a bridge constructed across a river is characterized
by a superstructure and substructure. The superstructure serves as a link between
the two sides of a valley, canyon, or body of water such asa river. It connects roads
and railways at the two terminals and facilitates traffi c movement. The substructure
transmits the superimposed load to the underlying foundation materials through
supports. The design of a bridge depends on its function, the terrain condition, the
materials to be used in the construction, and the available funds for building the
bridge.
Chapter_18.indd 397 10/26/2012 7:55:12 PM
398 ● Engineering Geology
To cross a small valley, a bridge may be made
of only a single girder or a beam placed on two
supports on the two sides called abutments.
If the river valley is very wide, intermediate
supports called piers are required. Thus,
between the two abutments, a bridge may have
a single pier or multiple piers and accordingly
it will be designated as a double-span or multi-
span bridge. In a multi-span bridge, the length
of the span between two piers may or may not
be equal. A long, continuous single girder may
cover the entire length of the bridge, or there
Fig. 18.1 A single-span steel beam bridge
may be several girders, each resting on two

piers. Fig. 18.1 shows a single-span steel beam
bridge constructed over a high-altitude stream, resting on two stepped abutments that support
the bridge and also provide slope protection.
The forces acting on a bridge are of two types, namely static and live loads. The static load
is provided by the weight of the material of the bridge including the supports. The live load is
generated by the vehicular and train movements over the bridge. The total load is ultimately
transferred to the foundation. Hence, the foundation should be strong enough to bear both the
static and dynamic loads. Past records of earthquakes of the area where the bridge is to be
constructed are studied and suitable seismic factor is incorporated accordingly in the design of
the structure to save it from damage from earthquakes.
The materials generally used in the construction of bridges include timber, steel beam, steel
cable, concrete, and reinforced concrete. A long bridge constructed over a valley with no apparent
stream or with a small fl ow of water below is called a viaduct. An aqueduct generally means a
water supply or navigable channel or canal constructed to convey water (see Section 19.6), but
the term also applies to any bridge or viaduct that transports water across a gap. A description of
the aqueduct crossing the river Narmada is included in the case study in Section 18.11.
18.3 MAJOR TYPES OF BRIDGES AND ACTING FORCES
There are fi ve major types of bridges, namely girder or beam bridge, cantilever bridge, arch
bridge, suspension bridge, and cable-stayed bridge. The magnitude of load of the bridge and
the forces acting on the support system considered in the design depend on the type of bridge
as explained in the following subsections.
18.3.1 Girder or Beam Bridge
The simplest type of bridge has two supports to hold a beam or girder. This is known as a
single-span girder bridge or a beam bridge, as shown in Fig. 18.1. A beam bridge is made of
Span wooden plank or materials such assteel or reinforced
concrete. The two abutments that support the bridge
Beam are concrete or masonry structures. In a single-span
Abutment girder bridge, the two abutments take the load
acting vertically and transmit it to the foundation
(Fig. 18.2). In the multi-span girder bridge, in

and river bed piers
In an arch bridge, the two ends of the bridge are
carried outwards curving to meet the ground on
the two sides of the valley on which the bridge is
built (Fig. 18.5). In this type of bridge, the weight
is carried outwards along two paths curving
towards the ground. As a result, the ground around
the abutments is squeezed and pushes back on the
abutment. Thus, in addition to vertical force, an
arch bridge works by transferring its load partially
into the horizontal thrust restrained by the
abutments at either side, as shown in Fig. 18.6(a).
Fig. 18.6(b) shows a double-arch bridge with

piers founded in river bed
the deck and the arch is known as spandrel.
Fig. 18.7 shows a spandrel deck arch bridge with
piers founded in river bed below water.
18.3.3 Cantilever Bridge
In the cantilever bridge, the end girders or
beams have extended arms to hold a relatively
small beam. As in Fig. 18.8, the two beams
of the bridge, fi rmly anchored with the piers,
support another beam that is the middle deck of
the traffi c-way. In a cantilever bridge, the total
weight is transferred vertically to the two piers
Fig. 18.5 An arch bridge and nearly no load is imposed on the abutments.
18.3.4 Suspension Bridge
The deck or traffi c-way of a suspension bridge is hung by cables that hang from towers. The
cable transfers the weight to the towers, and the towers transfer the weight to the ground. In a
suspension bridge, the stress is transferred vertically to the foundation but the bridge is anchored
with the bedrock or a large concrete block on two sides to provide stability (Fig. 18.9).
18.3.5 Cable-stayed Bridge
Cable-stayed bridge is in some respects similar to suspension bridge, both having a suspended
deck structure and towers called pylons. In cable-stayed bridge, the cables from the towers
go directly to the road deck instead of spanning from tower to tower (Fig. 18.10). The towers
form the prime load-bearing structure and do not require fi rm anchorage to withstand the
horizontal pull of the cables as in the suspension bridge in which the deck merely hangs from
the suspenders. In the cable-stayed bridge, the deck is in compression, under pull towards

115 m wide with nine lanes and is supported by 121 tension cables. It is the world’s third largest
cable-stayed bridge that stands on four pylons on a 100 m-deep foundation in alluvial deposit.

18.4 SUPPORTS AND FOUNDATIONS OF BRIDGES
A bridge has a superstructure and substructure. The superstructure imposes vertical load on the
foundation, and therefore, the foundation must be very rigid to withstand the load. The concrete
Chapter_18.indd 401 10/26/2012 7:55:14 PM
402 ● Engineering Geology
blocks of abutments bear the load of the superstructure and transmit the load to the foundation.
Where sound bedrock is available, the support of the bridge bearing the deck is placed on the
rocky surface that serves as a stable foundation.
18.4.1 Abutments and Piers
Abutments are the two terminal supports of a bridge that may be of different designs
(Fig. 18.12). They are made of concrete or reinforced concrete, but some abutments, mainly
the old types, are made of stone masonry works with lime and sand or clay as cementing
materials. For the purpose of smooth passage of road to the bridge, the abutments are designed
in various shapes. When an embankment connects the bridge, the beam or girder is directly
placed on the embankment by constructing retaining structures for the latter’s protection.
A single-wing abutment, or a bevelled-wing abutment with footing or with column support
is generally designed to provide the seat of the bridge and act as a retaining wall of the
embankment.

In addition to two abutments, a medium or long bridge requires intermediate supports
provided by the piers made of concrete or reinforced concrete. The base or foundation of some
of the bridge piers remains under river water at all times, but others may be on land during
dry season and under water during rise of river water level (Fig. 18.13). The piers that remain
under water are made cylindrical in shape with rounded edge to allow unhindered fl ow of tides
and currents, though piers of other shapes are also prevalent. If the valley spread is large and
river water is small, some of the piers may always remain overground. These are land piers or
viaduct piers.

The piers take the load of the superstructure to transfer it to the rocky foundation below. In
homogeneous and sandy soil, piers rest on spread footings. Spread footing is provided when the
pier is founded at shallow depths (Fig. 18.14). However, if the soil is heterogeneous in nature
with clay bands and the pier base is very deep, the foundation is laid on piles. The stability
of the bridge depends on the stability of the pier foundation. Any deterioration of the pier
foundation may cause settlement of the pier and failure of the bridge as experiencedin the case
of Chambal bridge in Rajasthan (see Section 18.11.3).

18.4.2 Well Foundation for Bridges
Wells are caissons that open at both top and bottom and are made of timber, metal, concrete,
or reinforced concrete (Section 6.16). All major bridges in India involving deep foundations
are constructed by well foundation. It is diffi cult and also expensive to construct bridge piers
by open excavations in loose deposits of river sections, which necessitates heavy support. It
is also diffi cult to restrict ingress of water. Hence, well foundations are taken up that involves
sinking down of the hollow shells (wells) inside the loose deposits by dredging up to fi rm
soil or bedrock. Well foundation is preferred to pile foundation in bridge construction when it
is necessary to resist large lateral forces. In a well foundation, the well remains a part of the
permanent structure of the bridge. In case of well foundation across a river, the base of the well
is always kept below the scour level of the river.
In general, the shape of the well may becircular, twin circular, double-D, dumb-bell shaped,
square, or rectangular, but it may also be of other shapes such as hexagonalor octagonal (Fig. 18.15).
For very large size piers and abutments of cantilever, suspension, and cable-stayed bridges, large

rectangular wells are used. A large-diameter well is advantageous to several small wells to facilitate
sinking operation and erection of shuttering, provided the base does not rest on sloping rock surface.
The maximum diameter of a single circular well is limited to 12 m for concrete steining and 6 m
for brick masonry steining. Nowadays, double-D and dumb-bell shaped wells are used for deep
foundations, especially for double-line railway bridges. Multicellular wells are used for founding
long-span bridges as in Howrah bridge and Vidyasagar setu over the river Ganga.

The top plug of concrete serves as shuttering for laying the well cap.
This is provided after fi lling the well with sand. The bottom plug ismade of concrete and is used
to transfer the load from the steining to the soil below. It is bowl shaped so that it possesses
inverted arching action. The well curb is made of steel. The outer surface of the well curb is
made vertical. The cutting edge is made of steel with sharp edge that can penetrate into the
ground and withstand stresses from boulders, blows, and so forth. It is anchored into the well
curb that partially bears the load of the well at the initial stage when only a part of the cutting
edge is in contact with soil. A considerable part of the load coming on cutting edge is taken by
skin friction. The framework of the curb is removed after concreting is complete.
The well cap made of reinforced concrete is seated over the top of the steining. It is needed
to transfer the loads and moments from the pier to the well below. Sand fi lling is done after two
or three days of laying the bottom plug. The sand used for fi lling the well should be clean and
free from clay, plant roots, and pebbles.
18.4.4 Sinking of Well to Subsoil
The operations involved in the construction of a well foundation for bridge pier are sinking of
the well foundation to subsoil below water, plugging of the bottom, plugging of the top and
providing a well cap of concrete, and fi lling the inside of the well with sand.
Chapter_18.indd 404 10/26/2012 7:55:15 PM
Bridges ● 405
The well is sunk by excavating material from inside under the curb. If the ground is dry,
initially excavation up to about half a metre above subsoil water level is to be carried out. In
case the ground is not dry enough for such excavation, a cofferdam is constructed around the
well site so that a dry ground like an island can be obtained to facilitate excavation. The size of
the island should be such that there is suffi cient space for movement of workers and to operate
tools. When the dry area is made ready, the centre point for the well is fi xed and the cutting edge
is placed. At the initial stage, some wooden sleepers are laid below the cutting edge at regular
intervals so as to distribute the load evenly during concreting operation. The excavation of the
soil inside the well can be done by workers when it is dry inside. If there is water inside for
more than1 m, the excavation is done by dredgers.
Initially, the well steining is built to a height of only 2 m and later it is restricted to 5 m
at a time. Vertical reinforcement of steining shall be bent and tied properly to facilitate the
grab movement during steining operation. As the well sinks deeper invariably meeting water,
the skin friction on sides progressively increases and the effective self-weight is reduced by
buoyancy in the portion of the well below water level, requiring larger steining thickness. To
counteract the skin friction and the loss in weight due to buoyancy, additional loading known
as Kentledge (comprising iron rail, sand bags, concrete blocks, etc.) can be applied on the well.
In sandy strata, the frictional resistance that develops on the periphery of the well is reduced by
spraying a jet of water on the entire outer surface of the well.
When the well has been sunk deep enough, pumping out of water from inside the well
becomes effective. If the well passes through a clayey stratum, the chances of tilts and shifts
are also minimized.
18.4.5 Depth of Well Foundation
A well should be founded on fi rm bedrock or thick sandy and clayey deposit of suffi cient
bearing capacity even when available at a deep subsurface below water level. A sandy bed with
adequate strength is always preferred to clay bed. However, a thick and stiff clay bed is also
suitable for laying the foundation if it has suffi cient bearing strength. If thin layers or lenses of
clay are present between sandy layers, the well foundation must cross the clay layer and be kept
on sandy bed or stiff clay further down (Fig. 18.17).

loose river deposits, showing removal of materials from inside

Chapter_18.indd 405 10/26/2012 7:55:15 PM
406 ● Engineering Geology
The most important consideration in well foundation is the maximum scour depth that can
be calculated by Lacey’s theory (Section18.8). The well should be of suffi cient length, called
grip length, below the scour depth to counteract the overturning moment due to horizontal force
acting on the bridge deck and that due to wind and water.
The maximum load on the subsoil under foundation should not exceed the bearing capacity
of the subsoil after taking into consideration the scour. The load or total pressure of the well
(except the wind and seismic force) should not be more than 25 per cent of the bearing capacity
of the subsoil. The effect of the skin friction may be allowed on the portion below the maximum
depth of scouring of the river bed material.
Two important criteria are followed in well foundation. First, there should be adequate grip
length (length inside the bed) below the scour level. The grip length is taken as 1/3D below
max
the scour level according to the code of practice of the Indian Road Congress, where D is
max
the maximum depth of the well foundation. Second, the well should be based on strata that can
resist the load transmitted on it. In general, the bottom of the well is kept on a predetermined
(by drill hole) stiff clay or thick sandy zone present in the river deposit whose bearing capacity
is adequate in relation to the transferred load. In river with deep water (restricted to 30m
depth), pneumatic caissons are sunk. Inside the caisson, there is a working chamber fi lled with
compressed air up to 3.5kg/cm2 that prevents entry of water and permits men to excavate loose
materials inside the well and remove them.
18.5 DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION
OF A BRIDGE SITE
In the engineering geological investigations of a bridge site, emphasis is laid primarily on the
following aspects:
(i) Selection or evaluation of bridge site in different terrain conditions
(ii) Exploration of the site by drill holes and laboratory tests of rock and soil samples
(iii) Evaluation of the foundation condition of abutments and piers
(iv) Search for concrete aggregates and earth for approach embankments
The engineers make the overall planning of a bridge project and prepare the layout of the bridge
site and related road and railway links, and so on. Engineering geologists have limited scope in
such a scheme of selecting the bridge site and their work is confi ned to the evaluation of geological
conditions and preparation of a detailed geological map of the site. However, in case of a new
project with a bridge to be constructed in a diffi cult terrain, an engineering geologist’s association
is required from the initial planning stage to also investigate the road and highway connections.
The general practice is to fi nd several probable sites and the site most suitable from both
geological and engineering considerations is fi nally selected. Topography of the terrain,
hydrology of the river, and the rock and soil conditions for the support of the superstructure
are important in the selection of the bridge site. The geotechnical problems and approach of
investigation in the hilly terrain are different from those in an alluvial plain as discussed in
Sections 18.6 and 18.7.
18.6 LOCATING A BRIDGE AT DIFFERENT REACHES OF A RIVER
A river that originates in a high mountainous terrain fl ows through steep and narrow valleys at
the upper reaches and then gradually broadens its valley as it descends down to fan out in the
plain. In the course of its journey through the hilly terrain with steep gradients, it forms terraces
Chapter_18.indd 406 10/26/2012 7:55:16 PM
Bridges ● 407
with thick deposits of boulders, pebbles, and sand at different levels along the banks. In the
alluvial plains, the rivers are generally large and carry a huge load of fi ner sediments in their
bed. The following subsections discuss the consideration for a bridge site to be selected in the
upper, middle, and lower reaches of a hilly terrain.
18.6.1 Upper Reaches
In the upper reaches of the river, the valley is narrow and V shaped. A single-span bridge
supported on two abutments can be constructed in such high-altitude hilly terrain (Fig. 18.1).
Rocks are commonly found exposed on both the banks or under a shallow cover of overburden.
Terraces are rarely formed and the hill slopes are rocky. With the setting of the rains, jointed
rocks of the hill slopes or debris deposited on banks may cause the problem of slide. The site at
an upper reach should be selected where hill slopes are stable and rock outcrops exist on both
sides of the river. Once the bridge site is chosen, geological mapping is to be done covering the
site and its immediate vicinity. The foundation of the area may involve rock cutting. If the site
is covered by overburden, initially some pits or trenches can be made to study the nature of the
overburden material. In case of thick overburden, each abutment is to be explored by a drill hole
made to a depth of 6m in fresh rock or 10 m to 15 m in the unconsolidated materials.
An idea about the hydrology of the river with respect to maximum water level, fl oodwater
discharge, and so on is essential for design purposes and can be obtained from the daily record
of measurements in the river. An example of the salient hydrological data required for design
of a bridge has been shown in the case study on bridges (Section 18.11). In the high altitudes,
meltwater from snow during summer and rains in the monsoon cause an increase in the fl ow rate
and consequent rise in the water level. Huge deposition of bouldery materials may sometimes
block the fl ow path creating sudden rise in water level. The snow-fed Teesta River in Sikkim
is an example. A bridge at such a location is, therefore, to be designed for construction at a
suffi ciently high level. Rock cutting for the abutment foundation and hill slope cutting for road
construction near the bridge site may lead to the problem of slide. In such cases, the cut slope is
to be stabilized by providing breast wall and making suitable arrangements for drainage.
18.6.2 Middle Reaches
In the middle reaches, the river valley becomes broader. Terraces are formed on the two banks
at different levels. A good site for the bridge should possess sound rock for the abutments. It is
also to be ensured that vehicles coming from roads along the foothills have suffi cient space for
turning to move over the bridge. The hill slope along the proposed side should be stable. The
hydrological information and rainfall data as stated in the selection of upper reach site should
also be taken into consideration in fi nalizing the site for middle reach. Invaluable information is
obtained from the study of the aerial photographs on river basins. The three-dimensional (3D)
view will also help to decipher the stability of the slopes. Geological maps are to be prepared
covering the proposed site and at least further 100 m on all sides. The mapping throws light
on the possible presence of weak zones. Sites having any major weak features such as a fault
traversing any pier or abutment are to be avoided.
A bridge at a site in the middle reach with a wider valley will require one or two piers for
supporting the superstructure. Bedrock is commonly available at a shallow depth at the pier
sites. If the pier and abutment locations consist of deposits free from boulders, some auger
holes may be dug at the fi rst instance to fi nd whether bedrock is present at shallow depth.
Accordingly, the drill hole programme may be prepared such that each pier site is explored by
Chapter_18.indd 407 10/26/2012 7:55:16 PM
408 ● Engineering Geology
a drill hole. In case the abutment sites contain thick overburden materials, these are also to be
explored by drill holes. The holes should penetrate a depth of 20 m to 30 m at each pier site or
6m into fresh rock, whichever is less. Water percolation tests are to be carried out in the holes
to determine the openness of joints and other planes of discontinuities. Samples of rock cores
are tested in the laboratory for compressive strength and other properties.
It is desirable that the piers and abutments are founded on bedrock if it occurs at a reasonably
shallow depth below the overburden cover, including the river deposits. The drill holes will help
in designing the depths for founding the piers. A geological cross section showing the bedrock
along bridge axis may be prepared from drill hole data, which will be a good guide to locate the
positions of the piers. The bedrock at the edge of the water and the lowermost terrace is subject
to erosion by the stream, resulting in undercutting, which may pose a problem for stability of
hill slopes. It may be necessary to protect the hill slopes by providing breast walls with weep
holes. Boulder pitching with wire mesh may be done at the water edge to arrest erosion and
undercutting by the river.
18.6.3 Lower Reaches
In the lower reach, the river is generally quite broad. It has already attained the matured stage
and will debouch into the plains with fan deposits. The bridge is to be located at a suffi ciently
higher level. The approach roads for the bridge may be taken through the plain and then with
a proper gradient to the higher level. This may involve excessive cutting of foothill areas or
making tunnels to connect the bridge level. In general, rocks are available for the abutments in
the lower reach of a hilly river. The increase in the width of the river will necessitate construction
of several piers.
The investigation for a bridge site at the lower reaches may be carried out in the same way
as in the middle reaches starting with geological mapping, followed by exploratory drill holes
at the indicated pier sites. Before fi nalizing the design for the pier sites, a bedrock profi le of
the river along the bridge axis is to be prepared. This profi le will show undulations depending
upon the extent of erosion in different parts. The piers may be erected at the ridge positions of
the undulation to obtain stable bases. This will reduce the heights of the piers and the cost. The
troughs of the bedrock profi le may be the effect of erosion along weak zones and should be
avoided. Under such a situation, span lengths may have to be designed accordingly.
18.7 BRIDGE SITES IN ALLUVIAL PLAINS
Roads and highways in alluvial plains may have to be connected with a number of bridges at the
crossings of small streams or big rivers. In a single-span bridge to be constructed across a small
stream, the geotechnical investigation is mainly restricted to abutment foundation. In the case
of medium bridges requiring construction of one or more piers, the foundation of pier sites, if
any, has to be investigated in addition to the abutments. The sites of large bridges over broad
rivers, involving construction of many piers including some in the underwater environment,
require detailed surface and subsurface geotechnical investigation by exploratory drilling for
each of the pier sites and the two abutments.
The landmass in the plains consists of soil or unconsolidated sediments and presence of
bedrock is not expected within the depth of pier foundation. Construction of a long bridge
over a large river will involve construction of many piers in the river section as well on the
banks, which will be under cover of unconsolidated deposits or soil. A geological map is to be
Chapter_18.indd 408 10/26/2012 7:55:16 PM
Bridges ● 409
prepared showing the area of normal soil, zones of unconsolidated river deposits, and presence
of peat or organic soil, if any. Exploration by drill holes will provide information on subsurface
condition at the site.
As the bridge will be suffi ciently long with several spans and piers, the total load (dead
load plus live load) will be many times more than a bridge in hilly region. Hence, the forces
transmitted through the supports (abutments and piers) to the foundation will be rather high.
The design load considers the structural load and hydraulic factors. Geological investigation
has to ensure that the strata on which the piers and abutments are rested have adequate capacity
to resist the forces as in the design load.
Pits and trenches are dug at abutments and pier sites close to the banks to fi nd the nature
of the soil, and representative samples are tested in the laboratory. Exploratory holes are to be
drilled to 30–50 m depth at each pier site, and samples of soils are to be collected from depths
by using a special sampler. The logging of the drill holes will reveal the thickness of sand zones
and clay zones, whether the soil is of homogeneous or heterogeneous character in its depthwise
extension, and whether any organic material or peat bed is present.
Laboratory tests on soil samples of the boreholes are to be conducted for properties
such as compression, shear, friction angle, and plasticity. A geological section showing the
soil characteristics at depths including laboratory test results of core samples is helpful for
designing the foundation of the supports. If the soil is homogeneous and sandy in nature, spread
footing is considered in the design. Coarse-and medium-grained sand obtain more strength
after compaction. However, if the soil is heterogeneous in nature containing numerous clay
stringers or if it is of clayey type, pile foundation is adopted.
The hilly areas, irrespective of the upper or lower reaches, are prone to landslides. The condi-
tion may further deteriorate after cutting of the hill slope for construction of bridge abutments
and approach roads. Tremors due to earthquake and monsoon rains may also aggravate the situ-
ation. Stability of the hill slopes around the proposed bridge sites should, therefore, be studied
before fi nalization of the site, and if required the site may have to be shifted to a safer location.
If shifting is not possible, suitable remedial measures are to be suggested.
18.8 BRIDGE FOUNDATION IN SUBSOIL IN RELATION TO DEPTH OF SCOURING
The load of the superstructure of a bridge is transmitted to the foundation material through the
supports such as the piers and abutments. Foundation of hard rock possesses suffi cient strength
to withstand the load or forces transferred to it, but topsoil or subsoil including river deposits
cannot bear the superimposed heavy load of the superstructure. For design purpose, the bearing
capacity of soil is known from the fi eld load test or laboratory test on undisturbed soil samples
collected from drill holes.
The foundation is designed after due consideration of both vertical and horizontal forces
acting on the soil at depth. In principle, the shearing stress exerted by the superstructure on the
soil should not exceed the shearing strength of the soil. As the designed stress of the structure
is in most cases more than the shearing strength of the soil, the foundations of the bridge
supports are kept on spread footing or piles. A safety factor of two, three, four, or more is
provided in the design of a spread footing. A safety factor of two will mean that the soil is able
to withstand twice the designed pressure on the footing. In a spread footing, the total imposed
load is distributed over a large area so that the load on unit area (or effective pressure) of footing
is decreased. The larger the area of the footing in contact with the soil, the less is the effective
pressure on it.
Chapter_18.indd 409 10/26/2012 7:55:16 PM
410 ● Engineering Geology
Bridge foundation is also made on piles. In a medium-sized bridge, timber or concrete piles are
used. H-beam of steel is used for pile foundation in large bridges. The piles can be most effectively
driven if the soil is not of very steep nature. The ideal condition is achieved when bedrock is
available at a reasonable depth to drive the pile down to the rock. However, in the absence of
bedrock, as is generally the case in bridge construction in plains, the piles are taken down to some
gravel or sandy bed at depth. The drill hole data on substrata is the decisive guide to locate the
sandy zone down to which the pile should be driven. The idea is to get a fi rm base for the piles
on which the load of the superstructure will be transmitted through the supports such as the piers.
An important consideration in the foundation design of a bridge is the depth of scouring. The
approximate depth of scouring may be calculated from the Lacey’s empirical formula:
f = 1.76(m)1/2
where m is the mean diameter of the particles in millimetres.
D = 1.35(Q2/f )1/3
where D is the normal depth of scour in metres and Q is the discharge of the stream in cubic
metres per linear metre of waterways.
The maximum scour depth D at the nose of the pier is found to be twice the value of
max
Lacey’s normal scour depth. D is measured below the HFL of the stream.
max
To avoid the problem of scouring, the foundation level is kept below the depth of scouring.
Another problem is the underwater erection of piers. In all large bridges, many of the piers are
founded in river deposits below the column of water. In fact, the seat of these piers may be far
below the unconsolidated deposit under river water. Close to the banks where excavation depth
exceeds 5m, piers are constructed by open excavation during dry season when the river water
recedes from the banks.
18.9 CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS FOR A BRIDGE
Construction of a bridge requires large quantities of concrete for its various components. The
retaining walls on the hill slope and abutment slope protection in the two terminals of a bridge
also require concrete. The coarse and fi ne aggregates for the concrete can be obtained from
the rockcuttings and river sands from the bridge site itself. If the passage to the bridge is to
be connected by embankments, there will be need for earth. In the plains, plenty of suitable
earth will be available, and in the hilly areas, the fi ll material may be obtained from rock spoils
in the hill slopes. In hilly areas, the undercuttings of hill slopes are protected by placing rock
slabs, which may be obtained from excavation of the rocky hill slope or collecting big boulders
from the rivers bed. To fi nd the ‘minute geological defects’ in the constituents of the concrete,
petrological study is to be carried out in the aggregate material.
Minerals such asopal, chert, chalcedony, and zeolite cause concrete–alkali reaction. There
have been instances wherein the piers of a bridge developed serious cracks due to presence
of these ‘minute’ minerals of deleterious effect. While selecting aggregate materials, these
deleterious minerals should be avoided. During the construction of the Son bridge in Uttar
Pradesh, fairly hard and durable Vindhyan limestone was initially selected for quarrying to
meet the requirement of coarse aggregate. However, petrological study indicated the presence
of abundant cherts, which react with alkali in cement. The Kajrahat limestone exposed on the
right bank of Son River was then used as coarse aggregate by crushing the rock to desired sizes
for the bridge construction.

18.10 SALIENT POINTS RELATED TO GEOTECHNICAL EVALUATION OF A BRIDGE SITE
A bridge is the link of roads, rails, and so on on the two sides of a river. Hence, the bridge site
will have to be selected as a part of the overall plan to accommodate the approaches from either
side. The structure should be cost-effective. A narrow river section reduces the length and
hence the construction cost is also reduced, but it may involve long diversion of existing roads
for entering the bridge. A site that facilitates easy connections without long deviation from the
roads should be chosen.
The hydrological study of a river provides information on the maximum water level, river
discharge, and related aspects. Study of aerial photographs provides data on drainage pattern,
bank erosion, terrace deposits, bed load, and so on of the river. All these pieces of information
are required to locate the bridge site on safe ground and for taking measures against adverse
geological situations.
The mere presence of rock is not a suffi cient condition for the bridge supports. The rock
should have the capacity to resist the designed loads on the supports. Laboratory test provides
information on bearing capacity of the rock. In-situ load test is the best way to confi rm the load-
bearing capacity of foundation rock. In hilly sections, rocks are generally exposed or available
under shallow overburden cover. In the investigation of bridge sites in such areas, exploratory
drill holes indicate the depth to bedrock. A bedrock profi le of the river section along the bridge
axis will help to locate the piers and abutments on rock foundation.
In the alluvial plains, a bridge site should be explored by drill holes for all the pier and
abutment sites. Sandy zone in the river deposit at depth may be chosen for placement of the
pier base. Soil samples from drill holes are tested in the laboratory for their strength parameters.
The pier and abutment foundations are designed on spread footings or piles so that the load
transferred by these supports to the soil is less than the bearing strength of the soil. Materials
for concrete aggregate required for constructing a bridge may be found from the rock cutting
and river sand. The sand should be free from minerals that react with cement to cause concrete–
alkali reaction.
A bridge fails due to settlement of supports under deteriorating condition of the foundation
strata. A study of such bridges is helpful to understand the problem of settlement and probable
cause of deterioration of the foundation strata of the concerned bridge. The knowledge can be
applied in the construction of other bridges under similar geological set-up.
18.11 CASE STUDIES ON BRIDGES INCLUDING A COLLAPSED BRIDGE
A bridge construction usually encounters several types of problems that are related to the
adverse geology of the bridge site, especially in relation to the weak foundation conditions
of the piers. Geotechnical investigation helps to identify the weakness of the site, if any, and
specify correct treatment. The following case studies are presented to give practical examples
of the problems faced at the bridge sites of varied geological set-ups and the geotechnical work
conducted at the site that helped in safe construction of the bridge.
18.11.1 Aqueduct-cum-road Bridge in Madhya Pradesh
A 35.5 m-high and 940 m-long aqueduct-cum-road bridge over the river Narmada near
Tilwaraghat connects Jabalpur with Nagpur by National Highway 44 in Madhya Pradesh. Of
the total span of the structure, the length of each of the 18 main ducts is 18m and that of the
11 viaducts is 20 m. An earlier bridge at its upstream part remained submerged by fl oodwater

for quite some time and this new one was then constructed. The following is the salient
hydrological data of the river:
(i) Catchment area: 17863 km2
(ii) Maximum fl ood discharge: 28,316.50 m3
(iii) Longitudinal slope: 1:3000
(iv) Highest fl ood level: 385.47 m
(v) Lowest water level: 360.02 m
(vi) River bed level (lowest): 358.00 m
(vii) Maximum mean velocity: 3.05 m/s
It is a 29-span bridge with 30 piers of which 19 piers have been designed for open-well
foundations, nine piers for sink-well types, and the remaing two abutment piers were founded on
rafts. The site is represented by different varieties of schists such asmica schist, chlorite schist,
and sericite schist, which are jointed to various extents and contain shear zones. Geotechnical
investigation was conducted by geological mapping (Fig. 18.18) including exploratory work
and 3D log of the pier sites.

The pier sites were drilled by 19 large-diameter (calyx-type) boreholes upto 25–30 m depth,
which gave only chips of rocks. Later, diamond core drilling was undertaken in ninepier sites.
The cores were tested for crushing strengths. The designed load was 6–10 kg/cm2. The bedrock
(schists) obtained at depths showed crushing strengths of 80–170 kg/cm2. The drilling proved
the presence of fi rm rock in most places within a depth of 5–11 m and piers were founded on
rock except for sixpiers whose bases were laid on stiff clay–kankar at depths of 5 m from the
ground. Geotechnical study helped to fi nd stable foundations for the piers at reduced depths

as compared to the earlier design and thus saved substantial amount of expenditure in project
constrction (Chibber, Chepe, and Ramachandra 1991).
18.11.2 Tikira High-level Road Bridge in Orissa
The 243m-long Tikira high-level road bridge in Angul district of Orissa was constructed across
a tributary (Tikira nala) of the river Brahmani. It connects Talchir with Rengali dam project
over the river Brahmani. The area covering the bridge site is a part of the Talchir coalfi eld
under Gondwana basin. The site lies over a wide boundary fault between the Archaeans and
the Gondwanas. Partly weathered, greenish, and gritty-to-pebbly Talchir sandstones of the
Gondwanas occur on the right bank, whereas Archaean pegmatite is found on the left bank and
quarzite occupies the central part of the bridge site.
Originally, 11 piers were proposed for the bridge site, but in the fi nal design seven piers
were provided. The span length between two pier varies between 21.5m and 37m. Drilling
at the seven pier sites indicated very low core recovery (only chips) that caused diffi culty in
fi xing the depths for pier foundation. Later excavation revealed the presence of rock (schist,
quartzite, and pegmatite) at the foundation levels of four pier sites but in a shattered or sheared
condition. From geological consideration, consolidation grouting for 6m to 9 m was suggested
in shattered rocks of all the pier sites and this was adopted to strengthen the foundation. As per
geotechnical suggestion, the three pier sites located on highly fractured and brecciated rocks
were specially treated by means of consolidation grouting, spread footing, and deep anchoring
as a measure against possible differential settlement. The bridge has been functioning without
any trouble since its construction in 2000 (Mukherjee and Ghosh 2004).
18.11.3 Failure of a National Highway Bridge over Chambal River in Rajasthan
The failure of the 742 m-long bridge over Chambal in Dholpur district of Rajasthan on National
Highway No.3 is attributed to incompetent foundation strata. Four of the arch spans of the bridge
collapsed due to the subsidence of a single pier in 1978, fourteen years after construction. With
a view to fi nding the reasons for the failure, the foundation area was geotechnically explored
with the help of drill holes at the 22 pier sites of the collapsed bridge.
Geotechnical study by exploratory drilling revealed that certain piers founded on jointed
limestone got affected due to the presence of solution cavities and fi ssures in the rock. The
foundation of other piers consisted of soft claymatrix conglomerate. At the pier foundation that
was affected by settlement, the drill holes indicated that the clay matrix of the conglomerate
was altered to 1 m-thick residual clay. Boreholes at the remaining sites of piers encountered
limematrix conglomerate, which was proved to have an adequate bearing strength, 10kg/cm2.
Artesian conditions were observed in all the drill holes. Based on the geotechnical fi ndings of
the subsurface condition, seven new piers had to be constructed by taking the foundation to
deeper parts in bedrock that could safely withstand the imposed load (Mathur 1983).
18.11.4 Foundation of Banas Bridge in Rajasthan
The experience gained from the investigation on the failure of the Chambal bridge was well
utilized in selecting the foundation for another bridge in Rajasthan over the river Banas near
Sawaimadhopur town. The Banas bridge consists of 12 piers. The span between piers 1 and 2 in
the right bank is 26 m. However, the length of each of the fourspans covering piers 3 to 7 is 27 m.
The area in and around the bridge is covered by alluvial soil with few outcrops of limestone
with thin shale layers.
Chapter_18.indd 413 10/26/2012 7:55:16 PM
414 ● Engineering Geology
Geotechnical study of the bridge site included subsurface exploration by eightdrill holes.
In the river section, bedrock was encountered below 7.5 m to 9 m of overburden material.
The overburden thickness on the left bank was found to be only 1 m to 2.5 m. Groundwater
was observed to occur at a depth of 3 m to 5m below the surface. Surface mapping and
exploratory drill holes helped to take a decision on the foundation depth. The foundation
was placedon dolomitic limestone below the depth of the scouring and also below the zone
of weathering along joints. Out of the twelvepiers, three were founded on bored piles and
nine on open foundation, resting on rock. The foundation was placed on dolomitic limestone
after ensuring that it had adequate bearing strength to withstand the imposed load of about
15 kg/cm2 (Mathur 1983).
18.11.5 Distressed Railway Bridge of Bhagalpur District, Bihar
An old railway bridge over Sahabgunj loop in Bhagalpur district of Bihar was severely
affected through settlement and subsidence of its right abutment and one of its four piers
(pier P4) in November 2007, resulting in twisting of the rail line (Fig. 18.19) and causing
suspension of service for a long time. Deep and wide cracks encircled the distressed abutment,
and subsidence cracks in two or three steps along the banks of the river and see page of
water through the cracks were noticed. Study of available exploration data at the bridge site
indicated that the abutments and the piers of the bridge were founded on 10 m to 11m thick
silty clay layer having low bearing capacity, which was responsible for the settlement and
subsidence.
Fig. 18.19 Twisted rail line over a distressed railway
bridge in Bihar caused by the subsidence of abutment
and a pier (Pal, Roy, and Mishra 2009)
Further investigation revealed that the distress in the abutment and pier has been caused
by the combined effect of scouring below the foundation, plastic deformation of foundation
materials, swelling pressure, neo-tectonic activity, and piping action. In order to rectify the
defect, stabilization measure of the foundation was taken up by the engineers. This included
sheet piling encircling the distressed right abutment. From geotechnical consideration, it was
also recommended to provide large number of relief wells to create see page path to relieve the
hydrostatic pressure. Ground cracks were sealed by sand mixed with coal tar. On completing
these measures on the bridge pier and abutment, the operations on rail line over the bridge were
restored (Pal, Roy, and Mishra 2009).

19.1 INTRODUCTION
This chapter deals with the geological approach in the selection of a highway
alignment. The main factor that requires attention in highway construction is
the pavement, which must bear the load of moving vehicles. Another important
aspect is the materials used, including concrete aggregate. This chapter presents
the specifi cation of the Indian Bureau of Standards for concrete aggregate and also
highlights the procedure for locating other pavement material.
19.2 HIGHWAYS
Highways pass through plains and land slopes extending over various types of soil
and rocks. Engineering geological investigation of a highway alignment is taken up
for identifying its geological problems and determining suitable materials for its
construction. The work approach in highway investigation is described below.
19.2.1 Site Investigation for Highways
In recent times, the need for geotechnical investigation for highway has become
essential as most of the highways are designed as two-way roads varying in width
from 6 m to 8 m and having 2–3 m shouldering on both the sides (Fig. 19.1).

or identify the type of treatment necessary to rectify the defects.
(ii) The volumes of cutting and fi lling required in different parts of the alignment are estimated,
the availability of materials such as soil and rocks in the nearby areas are determined, and
sites for borrow areas for soil and rock quarry are located.
(iii) Study along the alignment also includes measurement of soil slope and that of rocky
sections to ascertain the inclination of stable cut slopes and measures to be taken in the
design for the unstable slopes.
(iv) Soil samples are collected at every 200–300 m intervals to conduct laboratory analyses,
which provide knowledge regarding the variations of the soil types encountered along
the alignment. The ultimate aim is to fi nd the suitability of the soil for subgrade of the
highway.
(v) An important objective of the site visit is to assess whether the ground conditions of the
different sections are safe to carry the dead and live loads of the automobiles.
(vi) At the outset, aerial photographic study is taken up covering the proposed alignment
with special emphasis to locate the presence of peat, swampy land, and similar weak
features along the alignment and, if present, to ascertain their effect when pavement
is laid.
(vii) It will also be necessary to determine the amount of pitting, trenching, and drilling
involved in investigating the subsoil condition and the cost involved.
(viii) The most important part of the investigation is the preparation of a geological strip map
covering the areas along the alignment and its neighbouring parts, plotting soil cover, rock
outcrops with rock attitudes, and morphological features.
A report is prepared on the basis of the investigation and submitted with the geological map
and test data on soil and rock to help the engineering design and cost estimation of the highway
construction. The sampling of soil is done by pitting and trenching from 1 m or 2 m below
the surface. The tests conducted in the laboratory for soil include water content, dry density,
and consistency limits (Section 6.3). The report submitted also includes the intensity of the
seismicity of the area with specifi c mentioning of the areas of instability along the alignments
and recommendation for measures to be adopted to stabilize these sections. In general, the
rocky sections remain stable even with a cut slope of 60°, but in soil, the inclination of cut slope
should be 30° or less; however, this general rule may vary in individual sections depending
on soil or rock condition and attitude of rocks. Slopewise inclined beds, even if they are low
dipping and jointed, may require retaining structures to prevent slope failures.

19.2.2 Placement of Pavement Material and Drainage
The pavement is the most important part of a highway construction. It should be a stable and
waterproof surface that can withstand the wear and tear resulting from the impact of wheels. It
is to be so designed that the dead and live loads of automobile movement are safely distributed
to the pavement without exceeding its bearing capacity. The pavements are constituted of
certain layers of materials placed on the original ground called subgrade. The subgrade is the
base on which concrete slabs are directly laid for a thickness of 5–15 cm, or concrete slabs are
placed with some materials of crushed stones and sand as base course to make rigid pavement
(Fig. 19.2).

Several layers of material need to be placed above the subgrade for fl exible pavement as
shown in Fig. 19.3. The sub-base layer that lies above the subgrade is made of soil taken from
local pits. This is followed by a 15–20 cm thick layer of crushed rocks called base course.
The base course materials are properly compacted and then another layer of 5–10 cm thick
asphalt concrete is placed on its top. In some roads, even a thin coat of asphalt powder is
provided to make the topmost surface fairly smooth. The crushed rocks of the base course are
generally mixed with gravel, sand, and clay with cement or asphalt acting as binders. The layer
of compacted base course materials of fl exible pavement laid on subgrade acts as the most
protective bed to carry the load of vehicle movement.

Alternate cooling and heating due to fl uctuating day and night temperatures may cause
heaving and cracking of pavement, especially in summer months. In general, to prevent such
cracking of pavement, expansion joints are provided with tie rods between the pavement slabs.
Deterioration of the base course material with time may cause erosion of pavement, showing
signs of heaving at places. The main cause of such deterioration is the entry of water through
the surface to the material below. During rainfall, water enters into the subgrade and cracks
Chapter_19.indd 419 10/18/2012 5:25:53 PM
420 ● Engineering Geology
are developed. Figure 19.4 shows the cracks
developed in a pavement by passage of water
into the subgrade; the material of base course
are scattered with parts of the road section being
broken. Proper drainage is necessary to avoid
such breakage. Rain or snow-melt water in hilly
areas entering into the subgrade from top, below,
or sides may cause further deterioration of the
pavement and its side shoulders. To avoid such
deterioration and cracking of road pavement,
under-drains are provided, which prevent the
entry of water into the subgrade. These drains
are connected to gutters in the uphill side. In
the plains, reinforced concrete pipes are placed
below the saturated soil to drain out water to the
underlying impervious layer.
19.2.3 Quality of Aggregates and Their
Functions
Fig. 19.4 Cracks developed due to passage of water
into the subgrade
Raw materials such as crushed rocks, gravel,
sand, and clay are used as concrete aggregate for road constructions. The following guidelines
are specifi ed by Indian Standard (IS) (387–1970) for use of aggregate in concrete (see also
Table 12.3):
(i) Specifi c gravity not less than 2.6
(ii) Water absorption not to exceed 5 per cent
(iii) Deleterious materials (coal, clay, soft shale, micas, opal, etc.) not to exceed 5 per cent by
weight of total aggregate
(iv) Aggregate crushing value not to exceed 30 per cent in fresh sample and 45 per cent in
weathered sample
(v) Abrasion value (Los Angeles test) not to exceed 10 per cent in 100 revolutions and 40 per
cent in 500 revolutions
(vi) Soundness value (sodium sulphate test) for fi ve cycles not more than 12 per cent
The test procedures for laboratory determination of values for crushing, abrasion, and
soundness have already been described in Section 12.4. The percentage of deleterious materials
can be calculated by determining the content of deleterious materials in the aggregate (see
Section 12.7).
Toughness is the most signifi cant aspect of aggregates. The top of the pavement is hardened
and smoothened by concrete or asphalt. The upper part is made impervious. The lower part made
of aggregate should also be made impervious; otherwise, it may heave and the pavement might
develop cracks. In general, aggregate materials for highways are made of angular fragments,
which are resistant to cold and hot temperature conditions. It should also have high resistance
to thrust caused by moving vehicles, and hence, trap rocks such as basalt are considered to be
the most desirable material for aggregate.
The hard variety of sandstone with siliceous matrix when crushed may also serve as good
quality aggregate. The size fractions of the materials should be such that the void or pore spaces
Chapter_19.indd 420 10/18/2012 5:25:54 PM
Highways, Runways, Canals, Power Channels, and Flumes ● 421
are fi lled up by fi nes and the binder provides good bonding of the aggregates. Materials such
as clay, powder of dolomite, and limestone with some chemicals are used as binders. The void-
fi lling fi nes may be made from dust of silica, limestone, slate, or soapstone. The aggregate
should be inert and not undergo any chemical reaction. It should have very low coeffi cient of
expansion so that it does not undergo degradation such as erosion and weathering by natural
processes.
19.3 RUNWAYS
The most important aspect of runway construction that is discussed in this section is the laying
of pavement, including its construction materials. Drainage problems and the load-bearing
capacity of the pavement are the other important aspects discussed along with seepage problem
and its solution.
19.3.1 Plan of a Runway
Runway is one of the important components of an airport, which extends over a large area,
accommodating the passenger building, hangars, apron, and taxiways (Fig. 19.5). It is built on
a rectangular area in the airport land to facilitate landing and take-off of the aircraft. Aircraft
weighing 90 tonnes need an area of 30–40 m width for a runway and 12 m width for taxiways
with the length being at least 1800 m. Larger aircraft may require about 2500 m-long runways,
and close to sea level a stretch of 3000 m might be needed. The runway is a man-made structure
constructed of either concrete or asphalt, or a mixture of both. However, a natural surface
covered by gravel, dirt, grass, or ice is also utilized as runway for small and light aircraft,
provided the ground is plain and has no humps or uneven features.

19.3.2 Investigation Approach
The main consideration in the runway investigation is the topography and the drainage. The
location to be chosen for a runway must be an even ground. The area surrounding the runway
must be free from any large construction so that the view of the runway from a distance or
height is not blocked. Once the layout of the runway is fi xed, a programme for exploratory
drill holes is planned. Depending upon the nature of the ground, the drill holes may be spaced
100 m to 150 m apart through the central line of the runway and the depth to penetrate will be
10 m to 12 m. On the basis of the exploratory work, a cross section may be prepared showing
variations in the subsurface strata for the design of the runway pavement. Undisturbed samples
of different types of soil are collected from the drill holes and tested in the laboratory for size
Chapter_19.indd 421 10/18/2012 5:25:54 PM
422 ● Engineering Geology
fractions of particles and properties such as density, moisture content, and consistency limits as
well as for expansion nature for swelling clay, if any.
If the area is composed of homogeneous type of soil without any change in the soil type
at depth, auger holes spaced at longer intervals penetrating to a depth of about 6 m may
be taken up instead of drill holes. Investigation for foundation of an airport is the same as
that explained for building foundation (Sections 6.13–6.16). Groundwater condition should
be ascertained from the drill holes with respect to water table from the drill holes or from
any springs if available. Areas with old fi ll material or where groundwater level is close to
the surface require special consideration with respect to settlement problems and their
remedy.
19.3.3 Runway Pavement
The materials to be used in the construction of the pavement for a runway are decided based
on the local ground conditions and the type of aircraft to be used on the runway. In general,
the materials required and types of pavements are the same as that described in Section 19.2.9
(see Figs 19.2 and 19.3). Where ground condition permits, a rigid concrete-type pavement is
considered to be the most favourable. A concrete pavement is very stable and requires minimum
maintenance for a long term. However, if the study of topographical and drainage condition
indicates the possibility of settlement problems, it is preferable to install an asphalt–concrete
pavement. It is easy to undertake patchwork in such type of pavement as and when required or
on a periodic basis. If the runway is used only by small and light aircraft with very low traffi c,
it may even be possible to use sod surface. In all cases, the specifi cation given for aggregate
materials in Section 19.2.3 may be followed.
19.3.4 Seepage Problem in Pavement and Corrective Measures
Runway pavement surface is prepared and maintained to withstand maximum friction for
wheel movement. Water may seep into the pavement fl owing from side slope or upslope
and may even seep below the subgrade. Meteoric water such as rain or melting snow
may fl ow into the pavement entering through cracks or concrete joints. In areas with high
groundwater table, water may enter the pavement by capillary action. All these factors
increase the moisture content of subgrade materials, thereby changing the soil characteristics.
This causes decrease in stability of the subgrade when its water content exceeds the plastic
limit.
As a measure to reduce the water content in the subgrade or make it free from moisture,
pumping is undertaken to drain the accumulated water and adequate drainage arrangements
are made. The drainage arranged may be opened or covered ditches (sub-drains). In covered
drains, the possibility of clogging by muddy suspensions should be considered. Excessive entry
of water softens the fl exible pavement, which is then easily cut by heavily loaded axles. To
minimize the entry of rainwater into the pavement surface, the surface is fi nely grooved so that
water fl ows through surface fi lm into the grooves, thereby minimizing the chance of slip of
aircraft tyre.
In order to stabilize and take measures against heaving of expansive soil in the pavement,
quicklime and anhydrous lime products are used. Fly ash mixed with lime forms a synthetic
product that can retard the expansion. Transverse cracks may develop due to difference in
day and night temperatures, especially in summer and winter months. Spraying of suffi cient

quantity of water on the pavement during dry spells may prevent formation of cracks and solve
the problem of water seepage.
19.4 CANALS
This section describes the investigation approach needed for selection of canal alignment. The
excavation or fi lling involved in canal construction requires special study. The inclination of
cut slope and the requirement of anti-seepage lining and protective coating for a canal to be
constructed in soil and rock get special consideration in design. This section describes all these
aspects and the problem of canal construction through hill slopes and its right solution with
illustrative fi gures.
In the discussion of canal, the status of cut slope plays an important part. In the uncovered
section, lining needs to be provided to arrest seeping of water and stop consequent
drainage. Geotechnical investigation aids in selecting the power channel alignment and fl ume
route so that the stretches of unstable area can be identifi ed and stabilization measures can be
adopted.

Water level
Canals are artifi cial waterways that are mainly
used for irrigation and navigation by boat.

Fig. 19.6 Nomenclature of different parts of a canal water to the farmers for irrigation purpose.
For example, the tailwater of the Bhakra dam
is used for the irrigation of vast areas of Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan by a network of
174 km-long main line canal and 1110 km-long branch canals.
Engineering geological investigations for canals include the following aspects:
(i) Geological mapping and exploration by drill holes along canal alignment
(ii) Estimation of cutting involved in soil and rock
(iii) Stability of cut slopes in soil and rock and support requirement
(iv) Settlement of soil and problem of weak rock in canal construction
(v) Groundwater and its possible infl uence on canal excavation
(vi) Lining requirement of a canal for stretches in soil and rock
Ideally, the layout of the canal should be straight and it will have small gradient along fl ow
direction. A contour plan and cross section along the canal alignment are generally obtained
from the project authority for engineering geological investigation. Realignment of the canal
may be required in certain stretches having adverse geology or important religious or historical
structures. A long canal commonly passes through an undulating terrain consisting of soil as
well as rock. To fi nd the extent of cutting involved in soil or rock, it is necessary to measure the
horizontal disposition as well as the vertical extent of rock or soil up to the canal level. A canal
constructed in soil or rock may be rectangular, semicircular, trapezoidal, or polygonal in cross
section (Fig. 19.7).

19.4.2 Site Investigation by Geological Mapping and Exploratory Work
At the initial stage of site investigation, study of aerial photographs gives a quick appraisal
of the morphological and geological features of the area. Geological mapping of the area is
then undertaken along the canal alignment extending over at least 50 m on both the sides.
The geological map will show the soil-covered area and rock outcrops. The boundaries of
different types of soil are to be demarcated, and the types of rock and their degree of alteration,
attitudes, and weak structural features are to be plotted. If any cultivated land falls within the
canal alignment, it is to be delineated in the map. During mapping, care should be taken to plot
the slide-prone areas where slope stability measures may be necessary. The areas of tectonic
disturbances, pervious grounds, boggy areas, quicksand, and subsiding grounds are also to be
plotted, and care should be taken to avoid such unfavourable grounds wherever practicable. The
geological map will provide the base for further exploratory works by trial pits and drill holes
for the canal alignment.
Pits may be dug where the canal grade is available within a couple of metres below the
ground level. The type, in-situ density, and fi eld permeability of the soil are measured in the
pits. Drill holes are made at 300–500 m intervals up to a depth of 3 m below the estimated
level at canal invert. However, if fresh rock is available at the upper horizon and geological
knowledge indicates continuation of the same rock at depth, the drill hole should be restricted
to only 3 m in fresh rock. If there are variations in soil or rock types, additional holes, even at
intervals of 50 m, may be drilled to cover the varied types of strata.
Diamond core bits are required for obtaining cores for study of rock features at depth and
laboratory tests for rock properties. While drilling in soil, samplers may be used to collect
undisturbed soil samples from depths down to canal level. The soil samples obtained from
canal grade from pits and drill holes are tested for various parameters, especially those
related to soil stability analyses. If there is any anticipated major weak feature (e.g., fault)
continued at depth for a long stretch, seismic survey is carried out to determine how far it has
affected the canal media. The seismic survey reveals the thickness of overburden and bedrock
profi le. Electrical resistivity survey helps in the detection of pervious strata such as sandy and
silty beds.
Chapter_19.indd 424 10/18/2012 5:25:55 PM
Highways, Runways, Canals, Power Channels, and Flumes ● 425
The logging of soil or rock cores will provide data on the soil or rock type and the condition of
rock including the thickness of soil zone formed by in-situ decomposed or alteration of bedrock
and the dip of bedding, intensity of joints, and weak zones such as a fault. The samples of rock
and soil obtained from drilling are sent to the laboratory for quantitative data related to their
strength parameters and other engineering properties. The swelling index and clay minerals
present in the canal bed are determined in the laboratory. A cross section along the alignment
is prepared based on surface mapping and drill hole data to portray the subsurface rock or soil
condition up to a depth of 3 m below the canal fl oor. The approximate extent or volume of rock
or soil cutting required for the canal can be estimated from this geological profi le. The data
on soil and rock cuttings helps in the estimation of cost for contractual purpose. The more the
bore holes, the more will be the accuracy of the estimate. The geological section and data of
subsurface explorations are needed for the design of the canal.
19.4.3 Excavation and Filling Involved in Canals
Depending upon the terrain morphology and geology, a canal construction may involve
entirely excavating or entirely fi lling, or both cut and fi ll (Fig. 19.8). The canals are commonly
rectangular or semicircular in cross section when construction involves cutting and/or fi lling of
steep soil or blasting of rock. Canals that are trapezoidal or polygonal in cross section are made
in clayey soil ground, attributing better stability and operational facility. The major problems
in a canal excavation pertain to providing stable side slope of the canal and that of the hill side

traversed by the canal; settlement, scouring, heaving, and cracking of ground of canal bed;
and seepage from the soil or fractured rocks traversed by the canal. It is a favourable feature if
the canal passes through a terrain having ground elevation coinciding with the top level of the
canal. This is because the cutting involved in such case will be only for the canal dimension.
19.4.4 Design Aspects of Soil Slope and Water Depth of a Canal
In the design of a canal, the side slopes provided for the underwater portion of the canal are
slightly steeper than the portions over water (in berms). The side slope in unconsolidated
material is kept such that the ratio of vertical-to-horizontal distance is always less than 1:1
(Fig. 19.9). The approximate design slopes of vertical (V) to horizontal (H) for a 5 m-deep
canal for different types of deposits are as follows:
(i) Fine sand 1:2
(ii) Pebbly and sandy soil and also in clayey loam 1:1.25
(iii) Decomposed peat 1:2.5
(iv) Medium-to-coarse sands and also in sandy loam 1:1.5

The channel gradient of a lined canal is not steeper than 1V:1.5H. The slopes provided in
canal walls are steep to vertical while passing through hard rock. Rectangular canals as such
are very common in rocky hill slopes. The rock types and their degree of alteration are to be
considered in estimating the rock slope. In hard and massive rocks such as granite, the slope
may be vertical, whereas in hard shale or sandstone 1V:0.5H to 1V:1H slope will be safer.
However, in soft shale or sandstone, slopes steeper than 1V:1H will be unsafe. A survey of the
natural slopes in rocky hilly faces and rock cut quarries provides proper guidance regarding
the stable excavation slopes for canals in similar geological set-up. While deciding on the safe
slope angle, due consideration needs to be given to the heights of the slope faces.
Deep cutting is involved when the canal alignment traverses hilly terrain or high ground
above the proposed level of the canal level as shown in Fig. 19.10(a). The stability of the hill
slope or the high ground slope is signifi cant for the safety of the tunnel and needs consideration.
It is advisable to always take the canal through fl atter hill slope involving shallow cut.
From the stability point too, a canal laid on a fl at terrain is always safer than that passing
through a hilly terrain. Canals made by deep cutting of hill slopes are subject to landslides.
Canals dug in unconsolidated materials of hill slopes may cause debris slide and subsidence
leading to complete destruction of the canals, especially during rainy season. If the hill slope
is made of jointed rock, the undercutting of the hill face for canal construction disturbs the
rock mass and initiates rock slides, resulting in damage of the canals. Structural study of
the rock types traversed by canal alignment with respect to faults, joints, bedding dip, and
so on helps to ascertain the failure mechanism of rock slopes. The laboratory test results on
Chapter_19.indd 426 10/18/2012 5:25:56 PM
Highways, Runways, Canals, Power Channels, and Flumes ● 427
shear, cohesion, internal friction, and so on of soil mass are used to decide the safe angle in
soil slope.
Remedial measures for protection against slides of hill slopes should be taken up for the
safety of the canal structure. If the hill slopes are devoid of sound rock, benches of 1 m or 2 m
width are provided with side drains in the upper reaches. This is needed to ease the overlying
load, prevent rainwater fl ow to the canal, and arrest rock fall or debris slide. If the pathways
of the canal involve cutting of unstable hill slopes, retaining structures are provided, which
include breast wall or other structures with side drainage as shown in Fig. 19.10 (b) and (d). In
soft and pervious strata, the measures adopted include compaction of soil followed by lining.
If the soil is of swelling type, which creates problems of heaving and cracking of the canal bed
and walls, the expansive clay materials are removed and backfi lled by normal earth followed by
lining to the affected part (Fig. 19.10c).

Groundwater condition of canal areas is known by measuring the seasonal variations in
water levels through the piezometers inserted into the completed boreholes. If the water table
lies near the surface, special drainage measures will be necessary. The design should provide
proper drainage arrangement for draining surface water for the quantity of water that enters
into the canal during rains. Similarly, the drainage measures should ensure stability of the canal
slope and prevent groundwater hazards.
Canals passing through loess type of soil may cause subsidence and deformation with the
consequent creation of fi ssures through which water fl ows out. Peaty soil is also not good for canal
construction. Vegetation cover is provided by the sides of the canals to protect them from slide and
slumping. The canal water carries certain percentage of particles in suspension, which are carried
Chapter_19.indd 427 10/18/2012 5:25:56 PM
428 ● Engineering Geology
away and cannot settle down in the canal if the water moves under certain velocities. Settlement
of suspended materials may cause an increase in water level and consequent siding in canal wall.
Some amount of water in the canal is lost by evaporation and seepage through the canal bed
or walls. Lining is provided to the canals to prevent water percolation or seepage and to avoid
scouring of canal when it passes through loose sandy or clayey soil. It also reduces silting and
arrests slides in unstable areas. The velocity of water fl owing in canals is designed such that
there will be no scouring and siltation. This non-scouring velocity is dependent on the depth
of canal water and the average diameter of the bed material. The non-scouring velocity of a
5 m-deep canal is 11 m/s in sedimentary rock and 17 m/s in a concrete-lined canal.
Depending upon the materials used, linings are of two types—anti-seepage and protective
linings. Anti-seepage lining uses compact clay, asphalt, and bituminous coating in addition to
concrete or reinforced concrete. Protective linings are given to prevent erosion and scouring of
canal bed by paving stone slabs and pitching with reinforced concrete slab. If the soil of the
canal contains swelling clay, reinforced lining is provided to prevent heaving and avoid creation
of fractures in the soil.
All types of lining in canals are subjected to pressure when the water table is high. It is,
therefore, necessary to make drainage arrangements underneath the lining to avoid adverse
effect during drawdown and dewatering of canals. In hard rock lining is not needed, but it is
provided in uneven rock surface for smooth fl ow and complete prevention of water outfl ow
through the pores and fractures.
19.5 POWER CHANNELS
This section deals with the geological and engineering reasons for opting for a power channel
instead of tunnel construction. The case study given in this section indicates that the stability of
cut slopes is the main problem encountered in taking a power channel through varied topography
and geological conditions. This section elucidates the remedial measures that need to be taken
up to overcome the construction diffi culties. In addition, it also highlights the importance of
siphon construction to carry the water of canal or power channel.
19.5.1Choice of Construction and Selection of Alignment
Power channels are the canals that carry water from a natural lake, run-of-river scheme, or
storage reservoir for the sole purpose of power generation. In general, in a hydroelectric project,
power channel is a part of the water conductor system that comprises tunnel and also covers
duct. Decision regarding whether to construct a power tunnel or a channel is made depending
on the cost factor involved in the project as per the engineer’s design as well as on geological
conditions such as stability of hill slope, type of constituent material or rock including its
permeability, and geological structures along the power channel alignment. In hilly terrain with
soft and shattered rocks, tunnel construction may be a diffi cult proposition involving expensive
treatment, whereas a channel construction in such terrain will be more economical and safe.
Power channels traverse mostly rugged and hilly terrains. During investigation for selecting the
alignment, it should be examined whether the power channel route passes through stable lands.
Geological situation plays an important role in the consideration of protective measures against
sliding or collapse of channel walls. The channel while crossing the hill slopes with soft rock or soil is
commonly lined by concrete to permit undisturbed fl ow of water. However, in intact and impervious
rock free from joints, the channel may be kept unlined to reduce the cost. Concrete capping of power
channel is required where fall of debris is expected from the hill slope into the channel water.

19.5.2 Case Study on Power Channel
The 2.27 km-long, 18 m-wide power channel of the Loktak project of Manipur is aligned through
lake sediments comprising clay, silt, and pebbles with occasional vegetable matters. Its bed slope ratio
is 1V:1.5H to 1V:3H. The power channel experienced problems of subsidence of banks and heaving
of fl oor in several places and artisan water fl ow after it began its operation. Figure 19.11 shows
the geological profi le across the centre line of the power channel having adverse features such as
heaving, black humus clay, and ground cracking. Remedial measures such as drainage through sand
fi lter holes, grouting of bed, loading at places by means of concrete blocks, and providing cut and
cover ducts in certain sections could restore the operation of the power channel (Chowdhury 1990).

19.5.3 Siphon to Carry Water of Canal or Power Channel
A siphon that looks like an upturned ‘U’ is made of concrete or steel pipe. It is used to carry
the canal or power channel water from one slope to another across a valley (Fig. 19.12). Large
inverted siphons are used to convey water being carried by canals or fl umes across the fi eld for
irrigation. Any settlement of foundation of the siphon may damage the connected structures
making the entire canal system inoperative. Protection of siphon foundation against settlement
is, therefore, necessary. Hence, the geological condition of foundation site of proposed siphon
structure needs to be thoroughly evaluated and protective measures suggested where necessary.
The Gumti hydroelectric project of Tripura is a run-of-river scheme with a diversion dam. The
stored water is diverted to the powerhouse through a 2.42 km-long power channel that includes
mostly open canal with cover duct at places. The power channel traverses highly undulating
terrain with several low valleys, involving construction of several siphons to cross small valleys
including lowlands, locally called charas (Fig.
19.13). The area consists of sandstone and shale,
which are altered and structurally disturbed. The

19.6 FLUMES
This section deals with the landform and the geological condition of the ground when a fl ume
is constructed to cross a small valley, carrying the canal water. It explains with illustration the
construction of the engineering structure named trestle on which fl umes may be placed. The section
also includes a case study on a bridge-cum-aqueduct over the river Narmada. It further describes
an ancient aqueduct constructed under royal patronage for water supply and irrigation purposes.
19.6.1 Geological Problems and Remedial Measures
For reasons of convenience and economy, some portions of a canal alignment may be crossed by
other means of water conveyance such as fl umes, aqueducts, siphons, and pipelines. Flumes are
artifi cial water passageways made of timber, steel, concrete, or reinforced concrete in the form of
an open trough usually for water fl ow along the ground where excavation for a canal is diffi cult
or impracticable. They may be placed on the ground slope or above the ground on support.
Similar to a canal, they may be of various shapes such as semicircular, trapezoidal, or rectangular.
Undulated landform, steep ground slopes, and hilly terrain may be found unfavourable for canal
construction. In a topography that does not favour construction of a canal, a fl ume that is generally
of trapezoidal or rectangular shape can be constructed.
In areas that involve huge fi lling, instead of a canal, a fl ume is generally provided to reduce the
cost. At places of lowland, the fl ume is taken above ground by placing it on a trestle. When the
fl ume is laid on a continuous stretch, it can be constructed

In the latter case, the walls are separated from the inverts
by joints to function as breast walls. The trestle-elevated
fl umes are of two types. In one type, the entire load is carried
by the span between the supports, see Fig. 19.14 (a), and

in the other type, longitudinal beams between the trestle

of 30 m revealed heaving and subsidence cracks in the ground. The affected zone consisted of sheared
and pulverized phyllite in a decomposed state. As remedial measures, the materials were removed up
to certain depth and backfi lled by graded boulder, pebbles, and sausage fi lters of 1 m thickness. After
carrying out these measures, no further problem was observed at the fl ume path (Chatterjee 1983).
19.6.2 Aqueducts to Carry Water for Canal or Flume
An aqueduct is a water supply or navigable channel (conduit) constructed to convey water. In
modern engineering, the term aqueduct is used for a bridge-like structure supporting a water conduit
including canals or fl umes. The structure is built to cross rivers, gullies, or other natural depression.
In Fig. 19.15, an aqueduct supported and elevated on trestles is connected with the canal or channel
portion by a fl aring fl ume transition laid on the ground. A hinge provides watertight sealing to the
fl ume at its entrance to and exit from the aqueduct. Sometimes, an aqueduct-cum-bridge is built
over large rivers for fl ow of traffi c as well as conveying water. The aqueduct-cum-road bridge over
the river Narmada connecting National Highway 44 between Nagpur and Jabalpur is an example.

The Narmada aqueduct-cum-bridge forms a part of the Bargi canal system of the left bank. An
11.8 m-wide canal carries 127 cumecs of water through the aqueducts to supply 54.28 million
cubic metres of water to Jabalpur city for drinking purpose and for irrigation of land around
Jabalpur and Narsingpur districts of Madhya Pradesh. The 940 m-long aqueduct (length of the
18 main ducts being 38 m) is made of pre-stressed
concrete with carriage way width 7.5 m, footpath
1.5 m, and slope 1: 400 (for more details, see
Section 18.11.1). The structure resting on a large
number of piers is stated to be the highest and
unique of its kind in India (Chibber, Chepe, and
Ramachandra 1991).
It may be of interest to the readers to know that
though particularly associated with the Romans,
aqueducts were devised much earlier in the Indian
subcontinent. Evidence can be found at the site of
present day Hampi, in Karnataka (Fig. 19.16). The
massive aqueducts near the river Tungabhadra

20.1 INTRODUCTION
This chapter explains the theory of continental drift and plate movement in relation
to origin of earthquakes. It also explains the various aspects of seismic waves and
the methods of determining the origin of an earthquake. The chapter also highlights
the use of Richter scale for measuring magnitude and Mercalli scale for measuring
intensity of earthquakes. Geological investigation in any project site should include
the study of seismicity of the area from past earthquakes known from earthquake
zoning map, and suitable factor is to be incorporated in the design of the structure to
protect the engineering structure from damage of seismic shock. This chapter also
describes the available methods of forecasting an impending earthquake including
the Global Positioning System (GPS).
20.2 EARTHQUAKE
Earthquake is the rapid vibration of ground caused by the sudden fracture and
movement of large segments of rocks in the earth’s crust. The vibration may cause
extensive damage to man-made structures such as buildings, dams, and bridges
and trigger landslides, avalanche, and fl ash fl ood resulting in loss of property and
lives. This section discusses the causative factors, different types of seismic waves,
method of fi nding the origin of earthquake, and the nature of the earth’s interior.
Chapter_20.indd 434 10/18/2012 5:26:44 PM
Natural Hazards ● 435
20.2.1 Causative Factors
Earthquakes are caused by sudden release of strain energy that rocks had accumulated over
prolonged time of many thousands of years. Rupture of the earth’s crust along some faults
results in earthquakes. The rocks around the faults are weak and hence they are broken easily.
Powerful forces compress the rocks along a fault for a prolonged period. These forces will
make them to break apart and move. The sudden movement shakes all the rocks around leading
to an earthquake.
About 90 per cent of all earthquakes have depths less than 100 km (generally within 70 km),
but some have more than 100 km. Faults or ruptures restricted to a depth of one or two kilometres
produce minor earthquakes. The crust of the earth is composed of brittle rocks. The breakdown
of the crust occurs when elastic strain built up in the crust exceeds the effective strength of
the rocks in that part. Earthquakes associated with ruptures on normal faults commonly reach
the earth’s surface, but when hidden inside the crust, as in the case of low-angle reverse faults
(thrust), only seismographs can detect them.
20.2.2 Seismic Waves and Other Earthquake-related Terminology
The point below the earth’s surface where the rocks fi rst start moving is the focus or hypocentre
of an earthquake. The location on the surface of the earth vertically above the focus is the
ep icentre. The depth of the focus from the epicentre is called focal depth. The distance of
the epicentre from any place of interest (say, a seismograph station) is called the epicentre
distance. The movement of a large section of rocks in the
Plane of rupture (fault) crust creates vibrations called seismic waves that travel

in all directions from the focus due to an earthquake

are body waves and propagate through the earth’s interior.
The third type is the surface wave that travels through the

(underground)
which are called so because they travel through the body
Fig. 20.1 Propagation of seismic waves in of the earth— are termed primary wave (P-wave) and
all directions from the focus of an earthquake secondary wave (S-wave). The surface wave is known as
Love wave and moves from side to side.
There is another type of surface wave known as Rayleigh wave, which rolls like the ripples
in lake water. The P-wave is a compressional wave and is the fastest of the two body waves.
This wave is generated when the rock is pushed or pulled forwards or backwards. During the
propagation of compressional wave, particles of materials move back and forth parallel to the
direction in which the wave is moving. The S-wave is the shear wave caused when rock is
shaken from side to side like the wave motion. During the propagation of shear waves, particles
of material move up and down perpendicular to the direction in which the wave is moving
(Fig. 20.2).

20.2.3 Locating an Earthquake
Earthquake waves are recorded by a device known as seismograph and the record is called
seismogram (Fig. 20.3). In the simplest form, a seismograph carries a heavy weight tied to a
horizontal rod that hangs from a fi xed point and moves freely in the lateral direction when the
ground vibrates due to earthquake shocks. The rod carries a writing pen at its other end and a sheet
of paper rolled around a cylinder. As the cylinder rotates, the pen continuously draws lines indicative
of ground motion during earthquakes. A seismologist reads the pattern of lines in the seismogram
and measures the different parameters of the earthquake. In its present form, the seismographs are
very sophisticated and sensitive. There are strong motion seismographs that can detect and record
highly disturbing earthquakes near the source but other seismographs are designed to detect and
record even very small earthquakes from a long distance. In modern seismographs, seismic signals
are recorded on fi lm or magnetic tape in digital form that enables a computer to process the data.

Fig. 20.3 Seismogram of earthquake that occurred in Bhuj, Gujarat, in
January 2001
A seismograph records a series of waves that appear like waves on a sea with several peaks
and troughs. The height of the peak from zero position is the wave amplitude and the time taken
to complete the wave from one peak to the next (one cycle of motion) is the wave period. The
number of cycles of motion of wave per second is the frequency of a wave, which is measured
in hertz. The amplitude that is measured from the seismogram curve is many times more (may
be a thousand times) than the actual, and the amplifying factor of the seismograph device
needs to be taken in to account to get the correct value. Human ear can hear sound if its wave
frequency is 15 Hz or more, even in thousands. However, ground vibration of an earthquake
has frequencies of 20 Hz to less than 1 Hz. Hence, though in general an earthquake is only felt,
sometimes it may be heard to.

Natural Hazards ● 437
Prior to the invention of seismograph, earthquake effects were measured by visits to the places
affected by the earthquakes. The locality of maximum damage was then traced as the epicentre.
The classic work of R. D. Oldham (1899) of Geological Survey of India (GSI) on the Assam
earthquake of 12 June 1987 was based fully on fi eld visits that demarcated the epicentre from the
place of maximum disturbances and also worked out the source mechanism by adopting a state-
of-the-art technique. After the invention of the seismograph, the distance of the earthquake focus
from the seismograph stations can be measured from the travel times of the P- and S-waves. The
seismograph records the exact time of arrival of both P- and S-waves from the starting place
of disturbance. Since the P-waves travel faster than the S-waves, they arrive fi rst and then the
S-waves arrive. The difference of arrival times of the two waves increases with the increase of
distance of the seismograph station from the earthquake disturbance. This time difference is a
vital parameter in determining the epicentre distance of an earthquake (Fig. 20.4).

The various methods of locating the focus of an earthquake and epicentre are nearly the same
in principle. All methods basically depend on one factor, that is, the travel time of P- and S-waves
from the source (focus) to the seismographic station, which enables direct measurement of the
distance between these two points. Seismologists from their experience of studying the wave
patterns in seismograms have been able to determine by trial and error the average travel time
of P- and S-waves for any specifi ed distance. The time versus distance data can be plotted in
a graph and entered in a table. The appropriate distance between the seismograph station and
earthquake focus can be read out from this graph or from the table by comparing the arrival
times with those that were actually measured from an earthquake. The distance of an earthquake
from at least three seismograph stations when plotted by triangulation gives the location of the
epicentre, and the time of earthquake disturbance at the source can also be calculated.
Figure 20.5 illustrates the determination of epicentre distances d , d , and d to seismograph
1 2 3
stations A, B, and C, respectively, from the plotting of time intervals of S- and P-waves in a graph.
Thereafter, taking these distances as radii, a minimum of three circles are drawn to fi nd the
geographical location of the epicentre from their meeting place (Fig. 20.6). It should be noted
that the circles do not actually intersect at one point, but the actual location is to be obtained
from the interpolation of overlapping arcs. Today, seismograph stations spread out in the
different parts of a country and even in other countries can record the seismic waves generated
even from a moderate-size earthquake in any part of the world and can precisely locate the
epicentre with the help of computers.

Again on the basis of past experience, seismologists have prepared a ready reference chart for
the average distance of an earthquake epicentre from a seismograph station corresponding to the
difference of time intervals of P- and S-waves in reaching the station. Thus, the distance of epicentre
can be obtained from consulting this table when the arrival times of S- and P-waves are known
from a seismogram. Though the distance is known, the geographical location of the epicentre is not
known. Taking the distance as radius and the seismograph station as the centre, a circle is drawn.
The meeting point of a minimum of three circles drawn from three different stations gives the
geographical location (latitude and longitude) of the earthquake epicentre as shown in Fig. 20.6.
20.3 EARTH’S INTERIOR AND PROPAGATION OF SEISMIC WAVES
Knowledge of the earth’s interior and its crust is necessary to understand the propagation of
seismic waves inside the earth. The total depth from surface to core of the earth (i.e., the radius
of the earth) is 6371 km. The crust of the earth varies between 5 km and 75 km (Fig. 20.7), of
which the undulating land area of the crust is only one-fourth of the total area, the remaining
three-fourths being covered by sea of shallow depth. The temperature of the earth’s interior
increases slowly towards the interior and is above 2000°C at a depth of 400 km, which is
the upper mantle (Fig. 20.8). Further down, towards the lower mantle, there is a rapid rise in
temperature and the rocks are in a semi-liquid state.
In fact, the earth’s crust is fl oating on a semi-liquid layer of molten rock (magma) and down
below is the liquid outer core, whereas the inner core is in a solid state extending beyond a
radius of 3400 km. This solid inner mantle of the earth is composed of dense metal—iron and
nickel. The earth was formed approximately 4.5 billion (4.5 × 109) years ago during which time

the denser substance sank towards the core by a process of planetary differentiation, whereas
the less-dense materials migrated towards the upper part of the earth. It is argued that the solid
inner core would be in a giant crystal form. In a recent research (August 2011), Prof. Kei Hirose
of Japan placed a sample of iron–nickel alloy in the grip of the tip of two diamonds and then
heated it to a temperature of 4000 K with a laser beam. Later, the sample was observed with
X-rays; the observation strongly supported the theory of the earth’s inner core being in the form
of a giant crystal running north to south (Wikipedia 2012).
Seismic waves show properties of refl ection and refraction similar to light and sound waves.
They change direction and speed as they travel through different densities of the earth’s rocks.
The P-waves can propagate through solids such as rock and also through liquid and air. When
it passes through air, some sound may be produced. S-waves cannot travel through liquid or
air. Hence, a person will not feel it while travelling by air or sea. P-waves arrive a few seconds
earlier to S-waves. Surface waves travel along the surface of the crust and are the slowest of the
seismic waves. They arrive last but usually cause more damage than the P- and S-waves.
As soon as an earthquake is generated in rocks in the interior of the earth, the seismic waves
spread out in all directions and take only a few seconds to travel long distances. When these
waves reach the surface, the ground shakes and an earthquake is experienced. A number of
earthquake shocks also take place before and after the main shock and are termed foreshocks and
aftershocks, respectively. In general, the propagation of

20.4 CONTINENTAL DRIFT AND PLATE TECTONICS IN RELATION TO EARTHQUAKES
Alfred Wegener of Germany fi rst asserted the concept that light rocks of continents resting
over the heavy crustal materials of deeper parts slowly drifted from their original positions
through the long geological time. According to the modern accepted concept of earth scientists,
the earth’s outer crust is made up of several huge fragments of continental dimensions, which
are termed tectonic plates. These plates move relative to one another above a hotter, deeper,
and more mobile zone at average rates of few centimetres per year due to convection current.
According to this concept of continental drift, the earth was initially made up of a single
continent called Pangaea. Fossil evidence of Gondwanaland also proves that once there were
land bridges connecting Australia, India, Africa, and South America. However, eventually
Pangaea broke up to form the seven continents of the current time.
Plate tectonic theory explains the processes responsible for global and regional earthquakes.
Bolt (1999) has discussed in detail the theory of plate tectonics in relation to the earthquake
processes. According to this theory, the lithosphere, which is the crust and outer mantle of the
earth ranging from 80 km to 200 km in thickness, consists of several large and stable segments of
rocks called plates. These plates are, in fact, oceanic and continental parts of huge dimensions.
The plates have taken the current pattern by fragmentation of the ancient supercontinent
Pangaea over the past 200 million years. Below the lithosphere is the asthenosphere composed
of rocks very close to melting point. The asthenosphere occasionally rises to the lithosphere
through some weak places as a hot spot. Each lithospheric plate moves horizontally relative to
the neighbouring plate on the softer rock of asthenosphere in the lower part. The energy for the
driving mechanisms of the drifting plates comes from the heat produced by the decay of the
radioactive elements in rocks inside the earth.
20.4.1 Possibilities of Plate Movement and Resultant Earthquakes
There are three main possibilities of movement of the plates. First, the plates move together
causing ruptures of the crust at the edges of the plates. Second, the adjacent plates may move apart
from each other creating a widening gap between them. Finally, the plates may slide alongside
each other on transform faults. Thus, there are three environments in earthquakes caused by
plate movements, namely compressional (or convergence), extensional (or divergence), and
transform:
(i) At the convergent boundaries, the earthquakes are of the most severe types and originate
from shallow depths to deep parts of the subduction zone, which is a very deep trench in the
earth’s crust. There may be convergence of plates when the edge of a plate is moved down
and forced into subduction. The subducting plate is pushed down into the asthenosphere,
where it is heated and absorbed into the mantle rock.
(ii) At the divergent boundaries such as spreading ridges, the earthquakes originate at a
shallow depth along the spreading line, showing the divergence mechanism. Spreading
ridges or mid-oceanic ridges are formed due to the spreading apart of plates below the
ocean.
(iii) At transform, earthquakes originate from the motion of strike–slip fault generally
within a depth of 25 km. Transform faults connect the ends of subduction zones and
mid-oceanic ridges into a continuous network of earthquake-rich belt of the world
(Fig. 20.10).

Plate geometry is not a permanent feature but it goes on changing. In the subduction zone,
cool materials of the earth’s crust plunge inside and melt because of the high temperature inside
the earth. As the density of the lava increases, it becomes more buoyant and tries to come out
to the surface. However, material from the crust moves to the core and vice versa leading to an
earthquake or a volcano. In mid-oceanic ridge, there is constant ejection of materials from the
earth’s surface to form new crust. This material is deep seated on both sides of the plates and
is responsible for breaking apart or unifi cation of the plates. The processes arising from the
growth of the plates produce earthquakes along the mid-oceanic ridges.
20.4.2 Interplate and Intraplate Earthquakes
The earth contains several major lithospheric plates and their boundaries are seismically
active. There are many other minor plates too, but it is along the boundaries of the major
plates that earthquakes and volcanic eruptions take place. Earthquakes that occur at the contact
of two interacting plates are called interplate earthquakes. All the major earthquakes of the
Himalayan region are interplate earthquakes and originate in the collision zone of the Eurasian
plate and the Indian plate.
The earthquakes that occur within the plates are called intraplate earthquakes. Such
relatively low-intensity earthquakes arise from the localized system of forces in the continental
region. Stress due to compression is responsible for the generation of tectonic movement
related to intraplate seismic events that take place along intersecting fractures or a single plane
of rupture. Frictional forces along one of the fracture surfaces initiate the earthquake. The
earthquakes of peninsular India are of intraplate type.
20.5 VOLCANO AND ITS ACTIVITY RELATED TO EARTHQUAKE AND OTHER EFFECTS
Earthquakes may also occur due to volcanism, which is a phenomenon connected with volcanic
activity. Volcanoes have many effects on the earth’s crust. The molten rock or magma erupting
from the earth’s interior due to volcanism behaves differently depending upon its viscosity.
Chapter_20.indd 441 10/18/2012 5:26:47 PM
442 ● Engineering Geology
Viscous magma can cause explosive eruptions destroying lands and burn forests, habitats, crops,
and human properties. Non-viscous magma as lava issuing out of the earth’s interior fl ows to
the surface causing enormous damage of land and loss of human lives. The cross section of a
typical volcano will reveal the features as shown in
Fig. 20.11.

and the dissolved gases come out of the solution
Magma as expanding bubbles. Finally, the force of the
chamber gases blasts open a circular vent on the earth’s
surface through which ash, cinders, and lava fl ow
out. Near the top vent or crater, the volcano’s
Fig. 20.11 Cross section of a volcano showing its conduit is in the form of a cone. In addition to
different parts the main vent, a volcano may release lava and ash
from side vents creating subsidiary cones.
The surface features or landform originated by a volcano may be of different types from
towering peaks to vast sheets of lava. The features of volcanoes vary with the type of eruption,
nature of lava and other erupted materials, and subsequent erosion. There are four major types
of volcanoes, namely lava cones or shield volcanoes, cinder cones, composite cones, and lava
plateaus.
A lava cone volcano is usually formed by slow upwelling of viscous lava from steep-
sided volcano (Fig. 20.12) as seen in parts of California. It is also called a shield volcano as
it resembles a warrior’s shield. The Mauna Loa volcano in Hawaii is a classic example of this
type of volcano. It rises from the sea fl oor nearly 10,000 m deep to a height of nearly 4100 m
above the sea level.
A cinder cone volcano is composed of loose pyroclastic materials. The volcano mainly
ejects rock fragments of solid lava. Large quantities of ash are also released by this type of
volcano (Fig. 20.13). The eruption from the volcano is very explosive and the erupted materials
generally do not rise to more than 300–400 m above the surface. The slope of the volcanic cone
may be above 40°.

A composite cone volcano possesses concave cone-shaped sides and erupts ash and lava
alternatively (Fig. 20.14). Mt Fujiyama in Japan and Mt Vesuvius in Italy are examples of this
type of volcano. It is also known as stratovolcano because of its very large and symmetrical
structure. It is composed of lava fl ows and pyroclastic materials. In AD 79 the entire city of

Magma Pompeii was buried in three days by ash and pyroclastic
pipe Steep slope material that erupted from this type of volcano, which was
dormant through centuries. Sometimes solid lava seals the
main pipes to the crater and the top part blasts off to release
the pent-up gases. The summit may collapse leading to the
formation of a very big cavity called caldera. The Ngorongoro
crater in Tanzania is the world’s largest crater created by such
blast of volcanic summit.
Fig. 20.14 Composite cone type volcano
In the lava plateau type of volcano, the magma from the
interior comes to the surface as lava fl ow through fi ssures and after solidifi cation forms a huge
blanket of basalt (Fig. 20.15). The Deccan plateau basalt of India (Fig. 20.16) is an example
where the thickness of basalt is as high as 2199 m and the basaltic rock covers an area of about
650,000 km2. Another such lava plateau is the Columbia plateau, also known as Columbia
Basin, located in the Pacifi c Northwest.

Earthquake related to volcanism can cause ground deformation and destruction of buildings
and other man-made structures. It can also cause ground subsidence and large ground
cracks. When the injection of magma from volcano is sustained, it may produce a number of
earthquakes, called volcanic tremors. A volcanic tremor is thus an indicator of an impending
earthquake. Movement of molten rock from the earth’s inner mantle by thermal convention
current with gravitational effect and by plate tectonic motion can result in volcanism. Magma
intrusion by such volcanism may form large intrusive bodies such as batholiths, lopoliths, and
laccoliths and also dykes and sills (see Section 2.2).
When water interacts with volcanism, it acts as geothermal energy to create geysers,
fumaroles, hot springs, and even mudfl ows. On the earth, volcanism occurs in distinct geological
settings, generally associated with boundaries of enormous rigid plates that make the crust’s
upper mantle and crust. Nearly 80 per cent of the earth’s volcanic activity takes place where
two plates converge and one overrides the other. The island arc trench at the subduction zone
is an example of such volcanic activity. Another site of volcanism is the oceanic ridge system
where plates move apart on both sides of the ridge and magma fl ows out to the ocean fl oor
creating a new landform. The Hawaii Islands, in which active volcanoes still exist, were thus
formed in the Pacifi c Ocean. An example is the Kilauea volcano through the crater of which
lava still fl ows out (Fig. 20.17). With the movement of the Pacifi c plate, it is believed that
Kilauea will move farther away from the hot spot under the plate.
Among the chain of several volcanoes in the Hawaiian Islands, Kilauea is geologically
the youngest and it is currently the most active volcano. It still exhibits its upwelling basaltic

lava, which extends over a wide area of the
surface with glow of fi re as the molten lava
fl ows through certain channels (Fig. 20.17). The
magma chamber of Kilauea is estimated to be
nearly 60 km below its main vent to the surface.
The volcano showed its vigorous eruptive force
with upwelling lava and shaking of the ground
throughout the nineteenth century, and continued
to erupt many times in the twentieth century
and is still active. The frequent volcanic erupts
of Kilauea have made it a centre of study on
volcanism for volcanologists.
Local people believe that Pele, the goddess
Fig. 20.17 Upwelling viscous lava with fi re in Kilauea of fi re, lives inside this volcano. This belief and
volcano (photograph taken from helicopter) several tales associated with its eruptive history
have made it a spiritual site of signifi cance for
the Hawaiian people. Amidst the burnt forests and villages damaged by the fi re from Kilauea,
there still stands an isolated hamlet, where, it is said, long back lived a pious priest couple of the
local church, whose lives and homes were saved by the mercy of Goddess Pele.
20.6 MAGNITUDE AND INTENSITY OF EARTHQUAKES
Magnitude is the quantitative measure of the size of an earthquake. Its effect may vary with respect
to distance, ground conditions, construction standard, and other factors. Each earthquake has a
unique amount of energy, but the magnitude values given by different seismological observatories
for an event may differ. The scale for magnitude of earthquakes is not linear. The energy released
by an earthquake of a particular magnitude may be equal to the energy released by 30 earthquakes
of the previous magnitude. For example, the energy released by an earthquake of magnitude 6 is
about 39 times that released by an earthquake of magnitude 5 and is about 900 times that released
by an earthquake of magnitude 4. The energy released by an earthquake of magnitude 6.3 is
equivalent to the energy released by the explosion of the atom bomb in Hiroshima, Japan in 1945.
20.6.1 Richter Magnitude Scale
Depending upon the size, nature, and location of earthquakes, seismologists use different
methods to estimate the magnitude. The widely used scale for measuring seismic magnitude
is the Richter scale developed in 1935 by Prof. Charles Richter of California. Richter found
that at the same distance, seismograms (records of earthquake ground vibrations) of larger
earthquakes have larger wave amplitudes than those of smaller earthquakes and that for a given
earthquake the seismographs at farther distances have smaller wave amplitudes than those
at close distance. It means that larger the intrinsic energy of the earthquakes, greater is the
amplitude of ground motion at a given distance. On this observation, he calibrated the scale of
magnitude using the measured maximum amplitude of waveform (shear wave) with periods of
about one second. The record had to be obtained from a specifi c type of seismograph called
Wood–Anderson Seismometer. Later seismologists have developed the scale factors to extend
the Richter magnitude scale to all types of seismographs.
The Richter magnitude (M ) is given by the following expression:
M = Log A + 3 log (8Δt) − 2.92
10 10
Chapter_20.indd 444 10/18/2012 5:26:49 PM
Natural Hazards ● 445
Here, A is the amplitude in millimetres measured directly from the photographic paper of
seismogram and Δt is the difference in seconds between the times of P- and S-waves in the
wave curve.
The Richter scale in whole number varies from 1 to 9. It is such that the magnitude of the
quake is 10 times greater than the previous whole number. For example, an earthquake of 6
has 10 times the force of that with a magnitude of 5, or an earthquake of magnitude 7 has
100 times the intensity of that of magnitude 5. The typical effects of earthquakes in Richter
scale are stated in Table 20.1 for different magnitudes.

20.6.2 Mercalli Intensity Scale
Intensity is a quantitative measurement of an earthquake
based on its impact on people, land, and building. It is

with distance from the focus of an earthquake. In a map of
an earthquake-affected area, the curved line showing the

line and the map is called an isoseismal map (Fig. 20.18).

20.7 SEISMIC ZONING AND CODES FOR EARTHQUAKE RESISTANCE
20.7.1 Seismic Zoning Map of India
Seismic zoning map of a region is prepared based on the extent of damage suffered by the region
due to the effect of past earthquakes. The seismic zoning map of India showing fi ve zones (zones
I–V) was fi rst prepared by Geological Survey of India (GSI) in 1935 based on the damages
suffered in a particular region due to past earthquakes in the areas with an intensity higher than
Rossi–Forel intensity VII (equivalent to MM intensity VIII). This gave a design criterion of the
severity of damage that each zone is liable to suffer in case of future earthquakes (Table 20.3).
Since then several modifi cations have been made by Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS).

Nearly 60 per cent of the areas in India fall under the zones III, IV, and V. The Himalayan
region is within zones IV and V. Peninsular India was earlier considered to be a seismically
stable landmass but after the Killari earthquake of 1993 and Jabalpur earthquake of 1997
(see the table in Section 20.9), modifi cation has been made as regards the seismicity of the
peninsular region. In the revision of seismic zones in 2000, zone I (very low damage risk zone;
maximum intensity of V in MM or MSK) has been merged with zone II by the BIS seismic
zoning committee. Thus, there are now four zones, numbered II, III, IV, and V, in the earthquake
zoning map of India (Fig. 20.19). The intensity and probable earthquake damage that may be
suffered by these zones are as follows:
Zone II : The maximum intensity in MM and MSK scales is estimated to be VI. This zone
is termed as low damage risk zone.
Zone III: T he probable intensity in MM and MSK scales is VII. This is termed as moderate
damage risk zone.
Zone IV: T he area under this zone is equivalent to seismic intensity VIII in MM and MSK
scales. This zone is the high damage risk zone.
Zone V : This covers the area liable to seismic intensity IX or more (MM and MSK scales).
This is the maximum damage risk zone.
20.7.2 Codes for Design of Earthquake-resistant Engineering Structures
Deformation or damage of structures is caused by earthquake forces and ground shaking.
Seismic codes are prepared as guidelines for design of earthquake-resistant structures. When
an earthquake occurs, the ground moves in lateral sides and also in the upward and downward
directions. The forces that cause the movement of the ground can be resisted by the structure if
it is constructed following the guidelines provided in the seismic codes. The codes are based on
the probable maximum shocks that a structure may experience during its lifetime. The probable
maximum intensity of earthquake of an area is considered from the seismic zoning map, which
has been prepared from the past earthquake records of the area.
Throughout the world, codes for aseismic design are prepared to save man-made structures
from the destructive effects of earthquakes. In fact, the structural design is codifi ed to respond
to earthquake vibrations without damage in case of moderate earthquakes and save the structure

Fig. 20.19 Earthquake zoning map of India showing the four zones
from total collapse during high-intensity earthquakes. In 1962, BIS published the code IS
1893 for earthquake-resistant structures, which include structures such as buildings, dams, and
retaining walls. In the latest revision of BIS in 2002, this code has been separated into fi ve parts:
(i) part I for retaining tanks, (ii) part II for buildings, (iii) part III for buildings and retaining walls,
(iv) part IV for industrial structures, and (v) part V for dams and embankments. In addition, in
2000, codes for bridges over roads and railways were made in separate codes by IS 1984 and also
by Indian Road Congress IRC 6. The codes take care of the following criteria in the design:
(i) The structure can resist the lateral forces so as to prevent the collapse of structures.
(ii) The load-bearing capacity (size, shape, and structural system) of the structure is kept in
such a way that the fl ow of inertia to the ground takes place smoothly.
(iii) The lateral load-resistant system is made in such a way that under low-to-intermediate
earthquake shocks, there will be no damage to structures.
(iv) During high-intensity earthquakes, the structure will be saved by providing ductility.
Since the Bhuj (Gujarat) earthquake of 2001, it is mandatory to design structures (e.g., buildings)
following the code of earthquake-resistant structures in areas of seismic zones III, IV, and V.
20.7.3 Tips for Earthquake-resistant Design and Construction
The catastrophic Bhuj earthquake has also initiated the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur
(IITK), and the Building Materials and Technology Promotion Council (BMTPM) to release 24
tips for dissemination of knowledge on various aspects of earthquake, especially for construction
of buildings. It is to be remembered that an earthquake does not directly kill a person, but

20.8 RESERVOIR-INDUCED SEISMICITY
It has been found that under water-fi lled condition, some large reservoirs trigger earthquakes
known as reservoir-induced seismicity (RIS). The initial activity, generally of low magnitudes,
results from the instantaneous effect of loading and delayed effect of pore pressure diffusion.
Following this initial activity, major incidents of high-magnitude earthquakes take place several
years after impounding water in the reservoir to maximum water level. The delay in the large
event depends on the permeability of reservoir rocks, geological structures, and volume of water.
Widespread seismicity is observed in the periphery and deeper parts. The maximum intensity
in RIS is followed by decay in the activity continued for months and years. In Koyna of India,
even after three decades of impoundment, seismic intensity of lesser extent has been recorded.

20.8.1 Incidents of Reservoir-induced Seismicity in Different Parts of the World
Reservoir-induced seismicity has been reported from as many as 120 reservoir projects of the
world as mentioned in the International Symposium on RIS held in Beijing, China, in 1995.
In the 1960s, several severe RIS occurrence of magnitudes more than 6.0 on the Richter scale
were recorded from reservoirs of different countries such as Koyna of India, Xinfengjiang of
China, Kariba in Zimbabwe, and Krembasta of Greece. Study of reservoir loading in relation
to RIS has indicated that in most cases seismicity is associated with the initial impoundment
of the reservoirs. However, there are several cases in which RIS has been found to occur after
some years of initial impoundment. In the case of Aswan dam of Egypt, it was after 17 years of
impoundment that the reservoir triggered an earthquake (Table 20.4).

It may appear that RIS is the result of additional weight that a reservoir experiences after
being fi lled with water. Calculations have shown that the additional pressure or stress due to
Chapter_20.indd 451 10/18/2012 5:26:50 PM
452 ● Engineering Geology
the impounded water is only a fraction of already existing tectonic stress in the rocks below
the reservoir covering several kilometres. The reason for the earthquake is explained to be the
extra pressure resulting from the impoundment of water, which spreads out as pressure waves or
pulses through the pores or fractures of the rocks (Bolt 1999). Detailed fi eld study of the reservoir
areas has led to the conclusion that the factors responsible for RIS include ambient stress fi eld
condition, availability of fractures, hydro-mechanical properties of the underlying rocks, geology
of the area together with dimensions of the reservoir, and the fl uctuations in lake level.
20.8.2 Conditions Required for Generation of Reservoir-induced Seismicity
The following conditions generally need to be fulfi lled for generation of RIS, which is a shallow
focus earthquake with considerable damage potential over only a limited area.
(i) Water body of a reservoir depth of more than 100 m can produce RIS.
(ii) Access of reservoir water to the potential focal zone through interconnecting rock cracks
is necessary for RIS.
(iii) Optimum structural set-up (under gravity faulting and not thrust faulting environment)
very close to a limiting condition is required, so that a relatively meagre water load may
act as triggering effect. As already mentioned (Section 15.9), there is no evidence of RIS
in the Himalayan reservoirs mainly due to their location under thrust fault environment.
20.9 SEISMOTECTONIC FRAMEWORK OF INDIA
Seismotectonics deals with the tectonic features of the earth related to origin of earthquakes.
Understanding of tectonic features of a terrain helps to delineate seismically active zones and
design earthquake-resistant structures for such zones. The Himalayan region and the peninsular
plateau of India have been suffering from frequent earthquakes of varying intensities related to
tectonic history of these regions. The Himalayan region has been subjected to several tectonic
movements since Tertiary time. The maximum number of high-magnitude seismic events in
India has been recorded in this region. Earthquake records of the past 100 years indicate that
the Indian subcontinent has experienced over 600 earthquakes of magnitudes 5 and above and
most of the high-magnitude earthquakes (magnitude > 7) took place in the Himalayan terrain
whereas peninsular India experienced mostly low-to-medium earthquakes.
The most prominent tectonic event of the Himalayas is the collision of the Indian plate
with the Eurasian plate producing large-scale seismic activity in the plate boundary. The plate
boundary was at the Indus suture zone when collision began in the Tertiary time. In subsequent
time, it shifted southwards along the Main Central Thrust (MCT) and further later along the
Main Boundary Fault (MBF). The southern shifting is related to the convergence of the Indian
plate. The detachment surface represents the upper part of the Indian plate, underlying the
entire Himalayas. The thrust sheets (MCT and MBF) merge with the detachment surface at
depth. High-magnitude earthquakes located within this 50 km block between MCT and MBF
result from differential movements of discrete tectonic blocks. These blocks are the source of
neo-tectonic activity and geothermal manifestation (Narula 1999).
According to the tectonic model for the western Himalayas outlined by Dhar (1991), ‘the
Himalayan thrust belt is composed of two distinct segments: (i) a shallow portion, dipping
gently northward designated as “detached” and (ii) the steeper portion situated down-deep
from the detachment separates the basement of Indian shield from the overlapping sedimentary
wedge composed of Siwaliks of the lesser Himalaya. The basement thrust, on the other hand,
Chapter_20.indd 452 10/18/2012 5:26:50 PM
Natural Hazards ● 453
juxtaposed the basement rocks of the Indian shield in the foothill walls with similar rocks in the
hanging wall side.’ As per this model, all the great earthquakes (magnitude > 7.8) are produced
at long intervals in the detachment side whereas relatively frequent earthquakes of smaller
magnitudes take place in the basement thrust area.
During the past 100 years, eastern Himalayas has experienced many earthquakes of
magnitudes above 7 including the great Assam earthquake of 1897 of magnitude 8.7 (Table 20.5)
having their epicentres concentrated along the MCT. Some lineaments running parallel to
MCT are responsible for the Shillong earthquake of 1950 that devastated large areas of Assam.
Maximum seismic activity of the eastern Himalayas has been recorded from the subduction
zone where Indian plate has thrust below the Burmese plate. In the Shillong plateau, high-
magnitude seismicity has been developed from the northerly subduction zone of Indian plate.
Some major earthquakes have originated from faults parallel to the MCT. Regional tectonic
features such as Bomdila and Kopili lineaments across the eastern Himalayas have experienced
several seismic events along them.

454 ● Engineering Geology
Based on the synthesis of various works on tectonic framework of the eastern Himalayas, the
region was divided into fi ve tectonic domains (Gupta 2003):
(i) Main Himalayan belt (collision zone) trending E–W to NE–SW
(ii) NNW–SSE trending Abor–Mishmi Complex (the syntaxis zone of the Himalayan and the
Burmese arcs)
(iii) NNE–SSW to N–S trending Arakan Yoma belt (subduction Zone) that joins at the south
with the high seismicity zone of Sunda arc
(iv) Shillong plateau and Mikir massif marking plate boundary with Assam valley
(v) Bengal Basin and plate boundary zone of Tripura folded belt area
In the western Himalayas, the isoseismals drawn for a number of major earthquakes are
found to follow the regional trends (Narula and Shome 1992), but the seismicity trend in the
eastern Himalayas indicates alignment along transverse features such as Bomdila and Kopili
lineaments. The Tista lineament, which is oblique to the Himalayan belt, defi nes the western
limit of seismicity of the eastern Himalayas.
The peninsular region was once considered to be a seismically stable landform, but earthquake
hazard study of the area in the past two to three decades have indicated that the region has
been subjected to several high-magnitude (> 6) earthquakes such as the Latur earthquake of
30 September 1993 and the Jabalpur earthquake of 22 May 1997 with magnitudes 6.3 and 6.0,
respectively, and MSK intensities IX and VIII, respectively. Of the earthquakes recorded in the
peninsular region of India, the Kutch earthquake of 1819 had the highest magnitude of 7.8 and
intensity XI. Among the several earthquakes experienced by peninsular India and recorded so
far, fi fty-six are of magnitudes 5 to 6 and nine are of magnitude more than 6, of which two are
of magnitudes 7 and above (Table 20.6). The depths of focus of these seismic events are shallow
and confi ned within 20 km from the earth’s surface.

Seismotectonic evaluation of peninsular India indicates that the region is characterized by
intraplate types of earthquakes (Fig. 20.20). The region has varied rock types that include Archaean
crystalline, Cuddapah sedimentary metamorphics, Deccan Trap, and Tertiary sedimentaries.
The terrains have experienced more than 1000 earthquakes, mostly of magnitudes ranging from
3 to 5, in the past six centuries. The tectonic movement was restricted to two areas, which are
the relatively stable craton with large number of seismic events and the relatively active craton
characterized by structures such as rifts and graven.

The work of Pande (1999) has indicated that from seismotectonic angle, the region can be
divided into two units:
(i) Higher seismicity domain indicative of very active and extensive heat sources resulting
from strong tectonism in the intracrustal zones
(ii) Relatively stable tectonic domain where events of damaging earthquakes are large and
attributed to the compressional region along basement factors. For example, the Jabalpur
earthquake took place along the Narmada rift indicative of a relatively deep source.
One interesting feature of some low-intensity seismic events of peninsular India is the
rumbling sound. During the fi ve decades from 1950 to 1999, 13 places of this region have
Chapter_20.indd 455 10/18/2012 5:26:50 PM
456 ● Engineering Geology
experienced microseismicity, which is characterized by tremors known as swarm earthquakes,
which are sometimes accompanied by a sound. These earthquakes of low intensity and low
magnitude occur generally at shallow focal depth, and ground shaking lasts for a very small
period of time in seconds. Swarm earthquakes occur as a result of stress adjustment within a fault
system where several structural planes intersect and where enough stress cannot accumulate to
create even a moderate earthquake.
In Khandwa region of Madhya Pradesh, earthquakes with acoustic phenomenon were
observed for 25 years until 1999 and had continued even afterwards. Indian Meteorological
Department (IMD) and GSI monitored these earthquakes for fi ve months and recorded 700
microseisms with the peak magnitude of 3.1. The source of these earthquakes is within the soft
and saturated red mole of Deccan basalt at a depth of 1–10 km. The occurrence of such swarm
seismicity for a continuous period at a place suggests that the area is under the process of stress
building that may be a precursor of a major earthquake in future.
20.10 GEOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS IN ASEISMIC DESIGN
Aseismic design is based on the seismic code outlined by BIS for earthquake-resistant structures.
However, understanding of the probable behaviour of rock under a seismic event is required
before the construction is undertaken for large structures including high dams. In this regard,
engineering geological data assumes considerable importance in the design of the structure,
especially if it is to be built in a high-seismic zone or if any active fault is present close to the
proposed structural site.
In many areas, earthquakes occur as a result of reactivation of ancient faults that are not
exposed to the earth’s surface. The engineering geological investigation should aim at the fi rst
instance to determine whether the construction site including its surrounding area is affected
by any fault and then decipher whether there is a possibility of its reactivation to generate
earthquake in the lifetime of the structure. It is also to be seen if the motion in case of a seismic
event in the surrounding area would reach the structure.
An active fault is identifi ed by the presence of any tectonic effect in recent or Holocene
times (10,000 years). Instrumental test by installing seismographs is to be taken up to measure
the nature of ground motion along an active fault and decipher the possible earthquake ground
motion. RIS has been felt in many of the large reservoirs. In case of a large reservoir project,
therefore, the area should be investigated by geodetic survey to determine the nature of
deformation of strata that may take place after loading of reservoir with water.
Seismic risk is very high in marginal areas of the continental plates. Geological inputs
of possible earthquake effects are taken into account in structural design of this part. The
Himalayan region with complex tectonic features, especially the terrain in and around
MBF and MCT, is highly susceptible to seismic hazards. The 246 m-high dam of Tehri
hydropower project is located within a high-seismic risk zone of the Himalayas. Based on
the data of detailed geotechnical study on seismic effect, a number of defensive features
were incorporated in the design of this dam including liberal free board and fl atter slopes,
and even the type of the dam was changed from the earlier straight concrete dam to clay-core
rock-fi ll dam. By model test, ‘the safety of the dam was checked in actual accelerogram on
the severe earthquake parameter with peak ground acceleration value of 1.38 g vertical and
0.72 g horizontal both acting simultaneously and the dam was found to be safe against this
earthquake’ (Gupta 1999).
Chapter_20.indd 456 10/18/2012 5:26:50 PM
Natural Hazards ● 457
An aseismic design is aimed to mitigate or resist the disastrous effect of lateral movements
and vibrations of ground associated with an earthquake shock. The parameter of peak ground
acceleration or maximum ground velocity is of main consideration in the aseismic design. In
practice, the designer takes in to account the magnitude of earlier-recorded earthquakes and the
expected maximum magnitude for estimating ground motion parameter, so that in case of any
seismic event there will be no damage to the structure. The peak ground acceleration for the
various earthquakes located within a distance of 100 km from the focus can be calculated on
the basis of attenuation relationship as follows (McGuire 1974):
a = (472) × (100.278M ) / (R + 25)1.3
m
Here, a is the maximum ground acceleration (cm/sec2), R is the distance from earthquake
m
focus, and M is the magnitude of earthquake.
Peak ground acceleration up to 0.19 for subsurface structures (e.g., tunnel) located
within 80 km distance from the focus of an earthquake of magnitude 8 is considered safe.
However, this may not be true for surface structures for which the induced stresses due to
seismicity should be considered in the design for safety of the structure. In fact, earthquake
causes damage in three ways—ground shaking, slip along a fault if present in the vicinity
of a structure, and induced landslide. Geological investigation is taken up to evaluate all
these possibilities for consideration in the design of the structure. The normal approach to
resist earthquake shocks is to tie the structure fi rmly with foundation ground. All ground
movements are transferred to the structure that is designed to survive the inertial forces of the
ground motion. In major structures (say, a large building), these inertial forces can exceed the
strength of the structure. The design should ensure that the building is constructed of ductile
material so that it may deform but not collapse. Moment-resistant steel frame structures are
good for the purpose.
20.11 FORECASTING EARTHQUAKES
Forecasting of an earthquake has not yet reached a very accurate stage. The phenomenon of
earthquake prediction involves innumerable unknown parameters that cannot be detected with
technical precision. Earthquake scientists have forwarded several suggestions towards fi nding
clues of possible earthquakes as stated in the following subsections.
20.11.1 Measurement by Global Positioning System
The following are the various approaches for forecasting an impending earthquake:
(i) Studies in China and Japan have revealed that certain animals and fi sh behave very
strangely before the occurrence of an earthquake. However, its practical application in
forecasting an earthquake is found to be a diffi cult proposition as it involves keeping a
constant watch on such animals.
(ii) Continuous monitoring of the behaviour of the ground around an active fault zone for a
suffi cient period may provide some fruitful results. If the site of a large structure such
as a dam is traversed by a fault, precision survey by repeated levelling is required to
determine the possibility of earthquakes. If the survey shows minor displacement or level
difference between the two sides of a fault, an earthquake is expected to occur but the
time cannot be predicted.
Chapter_20.indd 457 10/18/2012 5:26:50 PM
458 ● Engineering Geology
(iii) It has been found that prior to an earthquake, water levels in lakes and wells suddenly go
down. Well water may completely disappear. Spring water may become turbid and ground
temperature rises before an earthquake. Such observations with respect to water level in
wells and springs sometimes give clues of an impending earthquake.
(iv) Prior to a seismic event, due to change in rock property, the velocity of P-waves may
change up to 10 per cent. Fluctuation in the speed of P-waves in the record of seismograph
installed close to an active fault is, therefore, considered suggestive of a possible
earthquake. If the active fault occurs in a large reservoir area, there is every chance of
generating an earthquake (RIS) under full reservoir condition.
(v) Geophysical survey by magnetic and electrical conductivity methods in high seismic
zones may provide indication of the possibility of earthquakes. In tectonically disturbed
terrain or faulted rocks, if magnetic and electrical conductivity tests show anomalies, an
earthquake is expected in the area. However, it is argued that the geophysical survey rather
proves the presence of a fault and in an earthquake-prone area a fault may be reactive and
hence causes earthquake hazards.
(vi) Radon, a radioactive gas, comes out to the surface in higher concentration through an active
fault or deep well prior to an earthquake. Nine days before the 1995 Kobe earthquake, a
tenfold increase in radon concentration was detected from a place 30 km away from the
epicentre (Bolt 1999). The measurement of this increased concentration of radon provides
clues of impending earthquakes. However, continuous measurement of radon release in a
fault zone for uncertain period of time is not a realistic approach.
(vii) The detection of strain in the rocks of earth’s crust by geodetic survey, statistics of frequency
of occurrence of earthquakes in time and space, and monitoring of the foreshocks by
precision seismographs may provide important clues of earthquake.
(viii) In recent times, measurement of low build-up of tectonic strain in the earth with the help of
orbiting satellite enables forecasting of earthquake in specifi c tectonic belts. Seismologists
can also measure movement along major faults using Global Positioning System (GPS)
satellites to track the relative movement of the rocky crust by a few centimetres each
year. This information may help predict earthquakes. Scientists in the US have been able
to measure the relative motion of plates by observing changes in earth’s magnetic fi eld
preserved in ocean crust. ‘These rates of movement of plates has been confi rmed by direct
measurement using space satellite through the GPS and by the relative motion of radio
telescope with respect to quasar signals from outermost space. All our information about
relative plate motion can be fed into a computer model that tells us the motion of any
given plate with respect to any other’ (Yeats 2001). This provides a promising approach in
earthquake prediction.
(ix) In recent times, an earthquake prediction programme funded by the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration (NASA) has accurately predicted 15 of California’s 16 largest
earthquakes since January 2000. The scorecard uses records of past earthquakes to
predict California’s most likely locations and time to have quakes of magnitude 5 or
above in every 10 years. The ‘scorecard’ is in fact one component of NASA’s QuakeSim
project, which develops tools for quake forecasting. It integrates historic data, geological
information, and satellite data including high-precision, space-based measurements from
GPS satellites and Interferometric Synthesis Aperture Radar (InSAR) with numerical
simulations and pattern recognition techniques for updated forecasts of quakes (USGS
Website 2004: Earthquake Activity).

20.11.2 Earthquake Disaster Mitigation
It is not possible to prevent an earthquake but its disastrous effects can be mitigated. The
impact of collapsed buildings or houses during ground shaking by earthquakes is the main
cause of loss of lives. It was found that the Latur earthquake of 1993 had collapsed 90 per
cent of houses (mostly brick built) in that area. It is thus the design of the house, including the
construction material used, that causes signifi cant damage during an earthquake. Earthquake-
resistant structures are constructed in earthquake-prone areas to resist earthquake shakings. The
main purpose of an earthquake-resistant house is to protect people inside the structure from the
disastrous effects of an earthquake.
Primarily, an earthquake-resistant structure is fi rmly attached to the ground so that the
ground motion is transferred to the structure, which is designed to survive the inertial forces of
ground movement. Wherever available, light materials such as wood and plaster are used in the
construction of houses. Hollow concrete bricks are also used. BIS has formulated building codes
for earthquake-resistant structures for the expected seismic intensity of the terrain as given by
the seismic zoning map. It is mandatory to follow these building codes while constructing any
structure in areas under seismic zones III and IV.
In seismically active terrain, in addition to constructing earthquake-resistant structures, the
place should be connected by good communication system so that in case of a seismic event,
amenities can reach in a short time. A disaster management body for educating people about
the effects of earthquakes and making advance plans regarding earthquake survival should be in
place. A network of instant warning systems is the fi rst and foremost requirement to transmit the
news of an incoming destructive earthquake to vulnerable places by fast-moving microwaves.
20.12 CASE STUDY ON A DEVASTATING EARTHQUAKE
The 8 October 2005 earthquake known as the Kashmir earthquake was a major one with a
death toll of 70,000 and 106,000 were injured. It is said that the earthquake was related to the
major tectonic event of collision of Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates. Figure 20.21 shows a
map depicting the Eurasian and Indian plates along with the Arabian and African plates. The
epicentre of the Kashmir earthquake is shown by the dark solid circle.
The Kashmir earthquake is considered to be the seventeenth deadliest earthquake of all
times. The United States Geologic Survey (USGS) measured its magnitude as a minimum of
7.6 in the moment magnitude scale and Japan Meteorological Agency measured it as 7.8 with
its epicentre falling at 34°29/35//N 73°37/44//E, nearly 19 km northeast of Muzaffarabad in
Pakistan-administered Kashmir. The earthquake affected India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan.
Such a high-intensity earthquake is comparable to the major earthquakes of the earth such as
the 9.1 magnitude of Indian Ocean earthquake of 2004 (see Section 20.13), 7.5 magnitude of
Quetta earthquake of 1935, 7.7 magnitude of Gujarat earthquake of 2001 (see Fig. 20.18), and
Sumatra earthquake of 2009.
A total of 147 aftershocks were registered in the fi rst day after the initial quake, with one of
magnitude 6.2. As on 27 October, after 19 days of the earthquake, a total of 978 aftershocks
were registered. The severity of the damage of the earthquake is attributed to its origin being
connected with the severe upthrust and poor construction of buildings and houses. Measurements
from satellite have shown the rise of the Himalayas by a few metres as a consequence of this
earthquake, giving ample proof that the uplift of the Himalayas is still continuing (Wikipedia
http://wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_Kashmir_earthquake).

20.13 TSUNAMIS
Tsunami is a natural phenomenon that causes immense damage of property and lives of people
living in the coastal areas of oceans. It has not been a regular feature in India, but in 2004 it
affected costal India causing extensive damage. This section discusses the effect of the tsunami
of 2004. It also highlights the methods of coastal protection as well as measures to be taken to
prevent damages caused by tsunamis.
20.13.1 Origin of a Tsunami
A tsunami is indicative of the destruction that can be caused by ocean waves. The word tsunami
is the combination of two Japanese words tsu (meaning harbour) and nami (meaning wave).
This natural hazard in the form of large waves of ocean causes destruction in the coastal area.
Tsunami is different from tidal waves, which result from the attraction of the sun and the moon.
Tsunami waves have larger wavelength, higher amplitude, and greater velocity than tidal waves.
Tsunami originates from an earthquake, which has its focus in deep ocean fl oor. An undersea
volcanic eruption or seabed slide may also create tsunami. In the ocean fl oor, an earthquake is
generated in the subduction zone due to the sliding of one lithospheric plate against another.
The energy released by an undersea earthquake of a large magnitude of 7 or above on the
Richter scale may cause rupture of subduction zone and sudden rebound of ocean fl oor giving
rise to tsunami.
‘A typical tsunami wave has about 10–20 m height, 200 km wavelength, and a speed
equivalent to that of an airplane, i.e., 700–900 km/hour in deep waters. Tsunamis contain about
1 % to 10% of the total energy of the earthquake that in case of a great event may release energy
equivalent to 1023 ergs equivalent to four million atom bombs detonating simultaneously. Since
the velocity of the Tsunami wave is a function of depth (c = √ gD where c is the velocity, g
acceleration due to gravity, and D the water depth) the wave speed decreases on approaching
the shallow continental coasts. As the period remains constant and the velocity decreases, the

wavelength gets shortened and the wave amplitude increases from a metre in the deep sea to as
much as 30 m in the shores.’ (Pande 2005)
20.13.2 Destructive Action of Tsunami
The damaging effects of a tsunami depend on the geomorphic feature of the coastal belt and the
density of people and their properties. A tsunami that comes as waves in succession of crests and
troughs can cause destruction in two ways. First, the impact of the waves damages everything
in their path and large areas bordering the ocean including agricultural lands are inundated by
saline water making the land unproductive. Second, the retreat of the waves with considerable
speed destructs everything on their path including buildings, household materials, livestock,
and even people and ultimately dragging them into sea water. Low-lying lands remain fully
inundated by water for a long time even after the ocean water has receded.
The tsunami waves originating in the deep ocean travel at a very high speed. Though the
speed of the waves decreases as they reach the coastal land, the wave height increases many
times. These high waves hit the coastal areas as troughs and crests in succession within a
duration of few minutes. The wave coming in as a trough causes sea water to recede, exposing
and scouring the seabed for a long stretch, but within minutes the high wave reaches the shore
causing severe destruction of property and life.
The rough confi guration of the ocean fl oor, especially the Pacifi c Ocean, is susceptible to
tsunami. Most of the tsunamis take place in the Pacifi c affecting the coastal areas of countries
such as Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, South America, Philippines, New Zealand, and
Hawaii. In 1883, an undersea volcanic eruption of Krakatau Island caused tsunami waves
35 m high, which devastated localities in East Indies killing more than 36,000 people. Japan is
the country that is mostly affected by tsunamis. It has been recorded that in 1933 a tsunami in
Japan caused the waves to rise to an extent of 30 m killing 299 inhabitants.
The greatest destruction recorded in the history of Japan was caused by the 11 March
2011 earthquake with a magnitude of 9.0 on the Richter scale and the consequent tsunami.
The earthquake triggered a powerful tsunami that swept over homes and farmlands in the
northern part of Japan. This resulted in the death of many human lives, and nearly 20,000
people went missing. It also set off a nuclear crisis forcing thousands of people to evacuate
their homeland.

20.13.3 December 2004 Tsunami on Coastal India
On 26 December 2004, the collision of the Indian Ocean plate and the South-east Asian plate
(Burma plate) caused displacement rupture of 1200 km length along the Andaman–Sumatra trench
creating an earthquake that threw up the ocean fl oor by 6 m and triggered a tsunami. The earthquake
with its focus 30 km beneath the ocean bed released energy equivalent to that of 100 atomic bombs
of the type used in Hiroshima. The magnitude of the earthquake was 8.9 on the Richter scale.
The Sumatra earthquake was so destructive that the landmass of Sumatra was uplifted to
different extents and shifted in southwest direction by nearly 8 m. The waves of the tsunami
travelled at a speed of 500 km/h. The height of two waves nearly 150 m apart in the mid-ocean
was only one or two metres. As they approached the shallow coastal area, the waves became
as high as 30 m. The giant waves dashed against the coastal land as a high wall and extended
to a distance of 1.0–1.5 km inside the land causing devastating effect on people and properties.
The tsunami that swept through the coastal areas of Indian Ocean on that day was the worst
in the recorded history of tsunamis of the world. Nearly two lakh people of many countries of
Asia and Africa bordering the Indian Ocean died and many more suffered from its destructive
effects. Of the 11 countries affected by the disturbances of the tsunami (Fig. 20.22), the death
toll recorded includes 122,232 in Indonesia, 30,974 in Sri Lanka, 10,776 in India, and 5395 in
Thailand. In addition, thousands of people remain untraced. The other countries that suffered from
the effects of this tsunami include Somalia, Maldives, Malaysia, Myanmar, Tanzania, Kenya, and
Bangladesh. Since 1767, Indian coastal areas have experienced 15 tsunamis that originated in the
Indian Ocean prior to the December 2004 tsunami, but those were not so destructive.
In India, Andaman and Nicobar Islands and the coastal parts of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh,
and Kerala were affected by this tsunami that caused huge loss of property and human lives. The
calamity was so severe in the coastal areas of South India that it caused complete collapse or
damage of thousands of houses and agricultural lands and the death of more than 6000 people.
Many of them were fi shermen who were engaged in fi shing in the ocean, far away from their
coastal habitats. One strange feature of the tsunami is the change in the marine environment
caused by the fl eeing of fi sh and other marine species from South Indian coast to other areas.
The drastic decrease in fi sh in the post-tsunami ocean water has become a constant source of
worry for thousands of fi shermen of the coastal south whose livelihood has been threatened.
Another tsunami-created feature is the covering of the rocky ocean bed of the coastal belt by
sand and silt deposits of enormous thickness.
In Andaman and Nicobar Islands, the giant waves of the tsunami moved with great speed and
deeply scoured the coastal landform and also brought about a change in the sea fl oor profi le.
The land was uplifted or subsided at places. Eruption of mud volcanoes and reactivation of old
faults were other features observed during the tsunami. About 1800 people of these islands died
and another 5500 persons remain untraced. Large stretches of agricultural land along the shore
were submerged by sea water as a result of the high waves. The ocean water receded after some
time, but even after two years the land was not usable for agricultural purpose as the salinity of
the soil was high.
20.13.4 Protection Against Tsunami
India had not experienced the destructive effects of a tsunami prior to the 26 December 2004
tsunami that lashed the coastal states of the south and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands
bordering the Indian Ocean. This has led to the realization that tsunami is a natural hazard that
should not be ignored as India is prone to further tsunamis and may have to experience its
Chapter_20.indd 462 10/18/2012 5:26:51 PM
Natural Hazards ● 463
destructive effects again. The gigantic trench (fault) below the Indian Ocean created during this
tsunami extends up to the Andaman Islands. This fault may be reactivated or a new rupture can
take place in future to cause an ocean bed earthquake that triggers another devastating tsunami.
It needs to be understood that the important factor is not the source of the tsunami but
the steps taken to protect life and property against its destructive effects. Whether it will
occur again is not of signifi cance but getting warned about it on time is. Observation of the
condition of waves in mid-ocean during a tsunami can predict the danger of an incoming tsunami.
Japan, whose coastal region is frequently affected by tsunamis, has placed several seismograph
systems on the ocean bottom covering the shelf and deep ocean parts for a distance of
200 km from the coast to get warning signals of the advancement of a tsunami before it strikes
the land.
When any earthquake is generated in the ocean bed, the tsunami centre at the shore station
instantly records the shaking, and in case of an impending tsunami immediately informs coastal
inhabitants through a well-grid warning system. India has gained technical knowledge in this
respect and is in the process of placing seismographs and warning systems to monitor round-
the-clock activity of the tsunami waves and storm surges in the Bay of Bengal and Indian Ocean
and provide warning to the coastal inhabitants.
Protection from tsunami should be taken up along with coastal management (see
Section 8.9). Construction of buildings and other engineering structures and human habitation
should not be allowed in the coastal areas as tsunamis may cause extensive destruction of life
and properties of people in such areas.

21.1 INTRODUCTION
Landslides bring about immense loss of property and even loss of human lives.
Geological and human actions and to a certain extent natural causes are responsible
for causing landslides in soil mass and rocks, especially in hill slopes. Investigation
methods of landslides include searching for their causes, identifying measures
to restore the damaged structures, and suggesting measures to ensure future
safety. Landslide zonation map is prepared to highlight the areas of instability
where there is a chance of occurrence of slide. This chapter describes all these
aspects and explains with illustrative fi gures landslide mitigation measures such
as modifi cation of slope geometry, drainage arrangement, and reinforcement of
slope.
21.2 HAZARDS OF LANDSLIDES
Landslide is a geological phenomenon involving downward movement of large
quantities of materials such as rock, earth, sand, and clay in any combination
(Fig. 21.1). The movement of materials may be very slow from a few millimetres to
a few centimetres per year, when it is called creep. In a fl ow type of landslide, the
materials may move very fast, even over 15 km/h. The collapse of the masses in a
landslide may also be very sudden as in an avalanche, especially in steep hill slopes
of high mountainous terrain.
Landslides bring about changes in the landform and affect people by causing
massive damage of buildings and loss of crop and livestock and even human
life. Landslides may disrupt the functioning of powerhouses, waterways, and

travelling public.

21.3 LANDSLIDE TYPES—CLASSIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION
Landslides are classifi ed in different ways depending on the various essential factors involved in
the slide mechanism such as the nature of materials, depths of sliding, speed of mass movement,
and nature of the failure plane. The most obvious factor is the nature of the masses or materials
such as rock, debris, and earth that are displaced from the parent body due to the landslide.
The mechanism of material movement, which includes falling, toppling, sliding, or fl owing, is
also a very important factor in the landslide process. Combining these two factors—the types
of materials and the mode of movements—the United States Geological Society (USGS) has
provided a classifi cation (USGS 2004) that is widely used in landslide investigation. This scheme
of classifi cation, provided in Table 21.1, is followed in describing the different types of landslides.

21.3.1 Falls
Falls are abrupt movement of masses of geological materials (rocks,
soils, and debris) that become separated from the parent body in
steep slopes and fall freely or bounce and roll down under gravity
(Fig. 21.3). Differential weathering, erosion and undercutting of
slope, unfavourable disposition of divisional planes with respect
to slope, and interstitial water are the main factors that infl uence
the fall of masses. In general, hill slopes steeper than 45° are
generally involved in falls. The failure surface in falls is planar,
wedge shaped, or vertical (Fig. 21.4).
An example is the well-jointed metadolorite that remained
exposed in one of the high walls of Barapani (Meghalaya) tunnel
after its roof collapse covering a wide area and repeatedly caused
rock falls.
Fig. 21.3 Fall—free fall of
Another example is the high rock falls that occurred along the
detached blocks of rock from steep

interrupted traffi c for quite some time. Here, the
rock fall was triggered by the blasting for road
extension in highly jointed arenaceous phyllite
(see Fig. 21.17). The devastating Malpa landslide
of 1998 in Uttaranchal was mainly a rock slide.
21.3.2 Topples
Toppling of the soil or rock blocks takes place
along planes of discontinuities by forward rotation
with respect to the point below the sliding mass.
The toppling failure is characterized by end-
over-end motion of rocks (Fig. 21.5). The rocks
involved in a topple move by action of gravity or
forces exerted by adjacent blocks. When the centre
of gravity (CG) of rock blocks fall outside the rock
mass, then there is a possibility of toppling. The
forces for topple of blocks may be created by water
or ice in cracks in the mass. The initial failure

surfaces being mostly vertical surface may be single or multiple (Fig. 21.6).

Examples of topple-type slide of jointed rock blocks are seen in joint locks in parts of road
cuts (highway) from Jammu and Kashmir where snow penetrating into the joint openings
widens the gaps and causes toppling due to gravity. The toppling of decomposed rocks shown
in Fig. 21.6 was observed in one of the abutments of a Bihar dam project after the dam and
abutments were excavated.
21.3.3 Slides
The slide type of failure may take place in varied types of materials including rock, soil, and
debris. Slides in rock always occur along well-defi ned surfaces with down slope movements.
Faults, shear zones, joints, and bedding or foliation planes of rock are usually the planes of

470 ● Engineering Geology
weaknesses along which the masses slide. The
two main types of landslides under this category
are rotational slide and translational slide.
Rotational slide
In this type of slide, which basically occurs in soil
zone, the surface of rupture is curved concavely
upward, and the movement is caused by rotation
of the slid material about an axis parallel to the
ground slope and transverse across the slide
direction. Rotational slide usually shows steep
scarp at the upslope end and bulging of toe of
the slid material at the bottom (Fig. 21.1). The
materials may creep slowly, or there may be a
sudden collapse or avalanche of large quantities
of materials that move over long distances. Figure
21.7 shows a rock slide in parts of Sikkim, where
a huge mass of rock collapsed from a scarp face
and rolled down a long distance.
Fig. 21.7 Rock slide Translational slide
During transitional slide movement of materials
takes place along a more or less fl at (planar) surface, sometimes with a slight backward tilting
(Fig. 21.8). The surfaces of ruptures are usually the contact planes between fi rm rock and
overlying loose earth, bedding planes of layered rock, and other weak planes in rock or earth
deposit. A translational slide may be a block slide involving down slope movement of the sliding
mass as a single unit or few closely related units as a coherent mass. Block slides are usually
seen in bedded rocks in which large blocks of rock move along the dipping surfaces of beds or
along divisional planes such as faults and joints (Fig. 21.9).

21.3.4 Lateral Spreads
Lateral spread type of mass movement occurs in fl at or low relief areas in saturated soil consisting
of loose sediments (sand and silt) that fail by liquefaction. Loose sediments underlying and
overlying fi rm and coherent mass (dense soil or rock) may liquefy when fractures are developed
in the overlying coherent materials due to shear and tensile stresses. The materials accompanied

it is termed lateral spread (Fig. 21.10). The failure is triggered by ground motion due to
earthquakes or induced vibration.

The movement of masses is like the fl ow of fl uid plastic in viscous state. The movement may be
a complete run out of the source materials of catastrophic nature. Depending upon the material
involved and the rate of movement, fl ows are classifi ed into four groups, namely rock fl ow,
debris fl ow, earth or mudfl ow, and creep.

small fractures, or even micro fractures, without concentration of displacement along a through-
going fracture’ observed Varnes 1978. Hungr et al. (2001) described the rock fl ow as extremely
rapid, massive, fl ow-like motion of fragmented rock from a large rock slide or rock fall. The
rock slope involved in rock fl ow may be 45° to 90°.
Debris fl ow
Debris fl ow is the most destructive type of landslide and results after heavy rains or extensive
melting of snow in the source area due to supersaturation of the ground with water. The materials
involved in the debris fl ow include large quantities of rock fragments or boulders and loose soil
with sand, silt, clay, and organic matter, the fi ne particles (2 mm or less) being less than 50 per
cent. The masses in the debris containing large quantity of water moves along the hill slope
generally within 10–20 km/h, but it may move at a faster rate depending upon the water content
in the slurry as well as the terrain morphology.
Initial failure (scar)
The debris fl ow is commonly initiated at the steeper
part of the hill slope, and with the fl ow continuing

water, earth, boulders, and vegetation including trees. As

it enters fl at ground, the materials of debris fl ow spreads
up as a fan encompassing a large track of land (Fig.
21.11). Debris fl ow may even dam a stream and block
fl ow of water. The bursting of such a dam creates fl ash
fl oods leading to further problem of ground slope failure.
The variety of debris fl ow in which the movement of

debris avalanche. Debris avalanche is common in
hilly terrain with slopes having thick deposit of
loose overburden materials and inclination of 20°
to 45° (Fig. 21.12).
As a result of cutting of the hills consisting
of regolith (decomposed rocks) with overburden
cover for making highways and roads, many of the
cut hill faces have become unstable. Hence, many
slides (mostly debris slide or debris fl ow type)
are encountered along the Sikkim and Darjeeling
highways (see Fig. 21.12 and Section 21.8).
Earthfl ow
Heavy rainfall in the hilly terrain of a moderate
slope constituted of soil or earth deposit is the
immediate cause of earthfl ow. The fi ssures
developed by the movement of earth materials
help infi ltration of water into the ground. The
ingress of large quantity of water increases the
Fig. 21.12 Debris avalanche of loose overburden
pore water pressure and reduces the shear strength
materials from a high hill
of the soil deposit, resulting in sliding of the slope
materials as slurry of earth or mud with water (Fig. 21.13). The materials involved in earthfl ow are
mainly fi ne-grained particles (clay, silt, and fi ne sand), but certain percentage of coarser particles
(debris) are usually present in the fl owing mass.
The difference between debris fl ow and earthfl ow depends upon the content of fi nes in
the fl owing masses. In earthfl ow, more than 20 per cent of the materials by weight contain
particles fi ner than 2 mm in size (Fig. 21.14). If the earthfl ow contains materials as high as
50 per cent of fi nes, it is normally called mudfl ow. The rate of material movement in earthfl ow
is slow to rapid (> 1.8 m/s or nearly 6 km/h or more), whereas in the mudfl ow it is rapid to very
rapid (> 5 m/s or over 18 km/h). Compared to earthfl ow, mudfl ow contains signifi cantly greater
water content to facilitate faster fl ow (Hungr et al. 2001).
Examples of mudfl ow are many as seen in Fig. 21.14. In Norway, in earlier years mudfl ow in hill
slopes used to be initiated due to the presence of quick clay (sensitive clay) band or lens in soil. Any

vibration will cause this clay to expand and the soil mass moved as fl ow over long distances along with
overlying trees or man-made structures including houses. New techniques of soil protection by electro-
osmosis have prevented such slides.
Creep
In creep, the slope materials move down slope at a very slow rate (few millimetres to few
centimetres per year). The shear stress in the materials induces the deformation responsible for
the slow movement but it cannot cause shear failure. Depending upon the operative process, the
creep type of mass movement may be continuous, progressive, or seasonal in nature.
Creep in a slope of rock or earth can be recognized from bending of trees, tilted electric poles, and
retaining walls or fences out of alignment (Figs 21.15 and 21.16). Layered bedrock below the soil slope
also bends downwards due to creep resulting in ripple-like features in the soil.

21.3.6 Complex
Severe landslides may take place by the combination of two or more types of material movements,
namely falls, topples, slides, fl ows, and lateral spreads. This combined effect of mass movement
is termed complex. Such slides of combined nature are distinctly visible in many highways.
Some of the slides investigated in Sikkim, Darjeeling, and Kashmir highways are of
complex type being debris slide combined with earth slide or rock slide. Figures 21.17 and
21.18 show the disturbingly famous B-2 and
Pagla slides of Sikkim and Darjeeling highways,
respectively, where landslides take place almost
every year with the onset of monsoon. See
the fi gure in Section 21.4.2 for a slide in an
engineering construction site, which is mainly
of man-made origin.
21.4 CAUSES OF LANDSLIDES
Two types of forces operate landslides, namely
driving forces and resisting forces. The driving
forces (shear stresses) act to cause movement
of the masses whereas resisting forces (shear
strength) tend to resist the slides. Landslides
Fig. 21.16 Soil cover of hill slope under creep
showing bending of trees occur when combined driving forces within

474 ● Engineering Geology
a land slope exceed the forces of resistance of
the materials that constitute the slope. Gravity
is the principal driving force of landslide
movement.
The other forces involved in the movement
of masses include earthquake, water fi ltration,
freezing and thawing action, and volcanic
eruption. These forces aid gravity to overcome
the resistance offered by the ground material and
initiate its movement. Most damaging landslides
are related to natural causes whereas some are
due to human actions.
Terzaghi (1950a) described the causes of a
Fig. 21.17 Complex landslide (earthfl ow and debris landslide as external and internal with respect
slide) in Sikkim highway
to the changes in slope morphology and its
constituent materials enforcing instability of
slope. The internal causes are responsible for
the modifi cation of materials and reduction of
resistance to shear stress, whereas the external
causes bring about a change in the ground
slope inducing an increase in shear stress and
thereby making the slope body vulnerable to
slide movement. In fact, the internal and external
causes mentioned by Terzaghi that are responsible
for land instability are geological or geology
dependent.
In the overall consideration, the causes of
landslides can be grouped under three major
categories, namely geological, man-made, and
Fig. 21.18 Complex landslide (rock and debris slide)
in Pagla Jhora in Darjeeling highway natural.
21.4.1 Geological Processes
Geological processes are primarily responsible for causing morphological change of land slope
and instability of landmass in different ways as follows:
(i) Erosion brings about a change in morphological features including steepening of land that
are prone to slides. Erosion also helps removal of cement and fi nes from materials that
weaken the strength of slope materials resulting in slope failures.
(ii) Weathering of rock changes the physical and chemical properties that bring about
reduction of shear strength, thereby promoting landslides.
(iii) Divisional planes in rocks such as adversely oriented faults, joints, and other planes of
discontinuities often cause rock fall type of landslides.
(iv) Swelling and expansion are also associated with upheaval resulting in landslides.
(v) Shearing, jointing, and fi ssuring are other geological factors that weaken the strength of
materials and promote landslides.
(vi) Leaching of certain ingredients from the earth creates sensitive clays (e.g., quick clay),
which may cause serious landslides (Section 5.9).

Landslide Evaluation and Mitigation ● 475
21.4.2 Human Actions
In many cases, landslides are created by human intervention as evident from the following
examples:
(i) Cutting of ground slope for various constructions such as buildings, roads, railways, and
other utility purposes, especially in hilly areas, leads to slope failure and movement of
slope-forming materials including fractured
and weathered rocks (Fig. 21.19).
(ii) C onstruction for human settlement in
unstable areas is responsible for many
landslides.
(iii) Blasting during mining or rock quarrying
weakens the stability of land slopes and
triggers their failure.
(iv) Vibration of machineries during engineering
construction is another reason to initiate
failure of unconsolidated materials.
(v) D umping of rocks or soil in a place after
digging of ground or stockpiling of ore
Fig. 21.19 Rock-cum-debris slide caused after slope
cutting for construction purpose develops stress in weak underlying materials
and initiates their slide movement.
(vi) Vegetation and tree roots help in the binding of shallow soil deposit with the underlying
bedrock. Cutting of trees and removal of vegetation cover are responsible for sliding of
soil deposit over the bedrock.
(vii) Overgrazing is also a common cause of slide movement of unconsolidated soil deposits.
(viii) Water leakage from utilities is another factor responsible for slides.
21.4.3 Natural Causes
The following are the natural causes responsible for many of the landslides:
(i) Landslides are mostly associated with heavy rainfall. Saturation of ground by heavy
rains or rapid snowmelt is responsible for the mudfl ows or debris fl ow including debris
avalanche.
(ii) Erosion or undercutting of slopes by rivers results in slope failures in river valley areas.
Wildfi re may also cause denudation of hill slopes and lead to failure of slope consisting of
soil and regolith.
(iii) Earthquakes induce stresses that bring about failure of weak slopes sometimes as
liquefaction when material moves like a liquid.
(iv) Filtration of excessive water to ground causes groundwater pressure that often acts to
destabilize the ground slope.
(v) Volcanic eruption that causes accumulation of loose materials and ash later generates
extensive debris fl ow with water pressure due to rains.
(vi) Ocean waves may also create oversteepening of seashore and bring about coastal slide of
the shore materials.
(vii) Freezing and thawing processes in high-altitude regions may generate loose slope
materials.
(viii) Sometimes, the action of thunder may trigger failure of unconsolidated ground materials.

21.5 INVESTIGATION OF AREAS AFFECTED BY LANDSLIDES AND SLIDE-PRONE AREAS
In the investigation of the slide-prone areas and areas where landslide has taken place recently,
aerial photographs and satellite imageries are studied at the fi rst instance followed by visits to
the area for ground checking. The type of landslide or the mechanism responsible for slides
can be decided only after ground survey. The ground inspection provides signatures of ‘minor
details’ that are not recognizable from the photographs. For example, ground cracks or defi ned
line of ground shifting covered by plants or bushes that bear testimony of landslides may be
diffi cult to visualize from the study of photographs.
A ground with some lateral shifting is indicative of old landslide effect. There may be some
downward movement or subsidence of ground that delineates the boundary of the sliding surface
of old landslides. In the study of the geomorphology, the disturbances are clearly brought out
including features such as the subsidence of the top and heaving of the toe of a landslide surface.
The slip surface when exposed is studied in relation to subsidence and the presence of slickenside
in the planes of the landslide-affected mass. Slickenside in the ground within the boundary of a
landslide is a defi nite proof of mass movement. Slipped block at the head is a clear clue of slide
caused by rotation of ground. Anomalous vegetation cover provides the clues for the area being
affected by old slides. Old slide scars or cracked grounds bear testimony to the area being affected
by landslides in the past. An area of old landslide may be covered by plants but features such as
inclined trees, tilting of fencings, and electrical poles bear evidence of landslide and creep. Land
slope with extensive toe cutting is an area prone to probable landslide. Movement of talus material
or sand fi lls exposed in the hill slopes are indicative of instability.
The general approach in fi eld investigation of landslide is the preparation of a contour plan
and plotting of geological features including rock structures covering the area affected by the
landslide. The causes of the landslide are evaluated and treatment of the slide-affected area for
reconstruction is proposed or remedial measures to contain future slides are suggested to the
engineers. The proposed measures are generally based on experience. It is, however, necessary to
carry out comprehensive fi eld investigation that includes study of the landslide pattern, delineation
of the boundary of slide-affected zone, and revelation of the slip surface of the slide. The ground
fi ssures, displacement or shifting of the strata, springs with oozing water, and so on that are created
by landslides are to be traced and recorded in the geological map. It is to be ascertained whether the
landslide was triggered by an earthquake, and if so, the intensity of the earthquake is to be known.
The slide mechanism with respect to shearing strength of the materials before and after the
slide, pore water pressure, and friction angle and other parameters of the material involved in
the slide are also to be studied. The shear strength parameters and other engineering properties
of rock or soil of the area subjected to slide are to be estimated by laboratory and in-situ tests
for designing effective measures by the engineers. The sampling should be representative for
determination of strength and other parameters by laboratory tests. Today, several instruments
are available to carry out in-situ tests. The estimate of shear strength parameters and other test
results are required for stability analysis. Depending upon the analysis, the corrective measures
are designed with the appropriate safety factor to contain the slide and stabilize the affected area.
21.6 Landslide Hazard Zonation Mapping
The preparation of landslide hazard zonation (LHZ) map is an important step towards
delineating areas susceptible to landslides. Different parts of the country have been affected by
large numbers of slides in the past, and several other parts are prone to landslides. Identifi cation
of such areas affected by landslides in the past and those that may be affected in future is the
Chapter_21.indd 476 10/27/2012 12:50:23 PM
Landslide Evaluation and Mitigation ● 477
objective of LHZ mapping. These maps can help the community to construct houses and other
important structures such as schools, hospitals, and powerhouses away from areas of potential
landslide risk. The landslide zonation map also helps in engineering planning for mitigation
means against the disastrous effects of landslide and in taking decisions towards development
work in the unstable areas under a strict regulatory board.
Several methods are available for evaluating the landslide susceptibility parameters of an area and
preparation of LHZ maps based on these parameters. The guidelines given by the Bureau of Indian
Standards (BIS) code of 1998 and modifi ed BIS code of 2004 are mostly followed in preparing LHZ
maps of our country (see BIS code through IS 14496 Pt II). The guidelines in BIS code are based on
six causative factors related to lithology, structure, slope morphology, relief, land use and land cover,
and hydrology. The value 1 or 2 is assigned as landslide hazard evaluation factor (LHEF) to each of
these causative factors in BIS code, the total LHEF being 10 (Table 21.2). This BIS code modifi ed
(2004) by GSI includes 10 causative factors with 14 estimated total LHEF (Table 21.2). The scale
used in preparing LHZ map depends on the requirement and is generally 1: 50,000 to 1: 25,000 in
macro LZS map and 1:10,000 to 1: 5,000 in meso or micro LHZ map.

The values of total estimated hazards considered for differentiating the intensity of fi ve

in preparing LHZ map is to divide the area into several facets marking the total estimated LHEF
on each facet. Depending upon the total estimated hazard value of each facet, the entire area is
classifi ed into fi ve hazard zones starting from very low hazard to very high hazard.

21.7 LANDSLIDE HAZARD MITIGATION
Landslide hazard mitigation measures are taken up for correction of existing landslides or
prevention of potential slope failures. In principle, the measures involve stabilization of the soil
or rock mass by increasing the resistive forces and/or reducing the driving forces. Five types of
methods are generally adopted in landslide mitigation, which are afforestation, modifi cation of
slope geometry, drainage arrangements, slope reinforcement, and provision of retaining structures.
21.7.1 Bioengineering or Afforestation
Trees largely increase the stability of the underlying ground by increasing root strength,
intercepting the direct effect of precipitation, and reducing pore pressure by evapotransportation.
Therefore, bioengineering methods including large-scale afforestation and protection of existing
vegetation cover need to be adopted in the landslide-prone areas. The selection of suitable plant
species should be such that they can withstand the existing hydrological conditions of the terrain.
Chapter_21.indd 479 10/27/2012 12:50:23 PM
480 ● Engineering Geology
21.7.2 Modifi cation of Slope Geometry and Prevention of Land Erosion
The geometric modifi cation of hill slopes or changing the shape of the slope surface is a cost-
effective way of stabilizing a slope. The success of the method, however, depends on the size, shape,
and position of the slope. In this measure, the angle of the soil slope is reduced by cutting a part of
the top surface or depositing fi ll materials on the foot of the slope. A combination of both reduction
of upper part and infi lling of the foot of the slope may also be done (Fig. 21.22). In very high hill
slopes, fi lling the toe is preferred, as reducing slope from the top involves excavation machinery
and is expensive. While excavating a place for bringing the fi ll material to stabilize a slope, it is to
be ensured that this does not create instability of the excavated place. In high and steep soil slopes,
berms are provided by cutting the slope surface into stepped segments so as to place the weight of
the soil at the toe. In doing so, it is to be seen that such cutting does not initiate creep movement.

The slope after re-profi ling needs to be protected against erosion and infi ltration of meteoric
water. This is done by providing impervious cover and making adequate drainage arrangements.
Several types of anti-erosion and environment-friendly biomats and bionets (synthetic products)
are now available, which can be spread over the re-profi led surface to prevent erosion. Asphalt
mulching of the surface is also adopted as a protective measure against erosion. Grassing of
surface protects erosion by binding the soil with long roots. Catch drains (contour drains) are
dug at the top to drain out surface water, and perforated pipes are inserted into the soil to drive
out water from inside the soil mass. Landslide mitigation by modifi cation of slope geometry
cannot be applied to stabilize a slope affected by a long translation slide. In case of debris fl ow
type of landslide, check dams with soil cement are sometimes constructed in a stream, which
can yield much sediment from large landslide-prone areas at the upstream part.
In rock slopes, geometric modifi cation is done by the removal of highly weathered, extremely
fi ssured, and overhanging rock blocks from the rocky surface. Vegetation or plants that widen
the roots to rock joints are also removed. The sole idea is to remove the shallow unstable rock
mass from the upper surface and expose the fi rm and sound rock from beneath to obtain a stable
bedrock surface. The measure prevents rock falls or topples from the hills slopes, which damage
habitation structures and endanger people at the foothill region. The topographic modifi cation
of hill slopes can be done by pickaxes; when explosives are used, only controlled blasting is to
be undertaken to avoid development of cracks in the rock mass.
21.7.3 Drainage Arrangements in Relation to Groundwater Management
Drainage is the widely used and most effective method in stabilizing ground, especially when
used in combination with modifi cation of slope geometry. Slope stabilization by drainage is also
less expensive than other landslide mitigation measures. An integrated drainage arrangement for
Chapter_21.indd 480 10/27/2012 12:50:23 PM
Landslide Evaluation and Mitigation ● 481
the re-profi led slope includes diverting surface run-off from the unstable area by shallow surface
channels and lowering of groundwater level by deep drains and trenches. If groundwater occurs
at a shallow depth, generally a combination of vertical boreholes connected with sub-horizontal
(10°–15°) boreholes oriented uphill are used for drainage by gravity. Shallow unbroken drainage
trenches fi lled with permeable granular material and connected by perforated pipes at their bottom
parts are also very effective in removing water from the soil mass at a shallow depth (Fig. 21.23).
Drainage trench
Perforated pipe
Collector gallery
Fig. 21.23 Stabilization of ground slope by drainage
arrangement
In order to provide deep drainage, isolated wells are developed covering the area to be
drained. This system needs constant operation of drainage pump for each of the wells. In case
of drainage of water from the failure surface, deep drains or trenches are to be dug extending
below the slip surface or shear plane of the landslide. In the sites affected by deep landslides,
tunnels or galleries are excavated into the intact soil mass below the slid mass linked with a
series of vertical wells sunk from the ground surface. This drainage measure, though expensive,
is very effective in removing water from the soil and lowering the groundwater level. If the
groundwater level is very deep, a combination of vertical drainage wells connected with a
network of sub-vertical borehole drains is used to remove groundwater from the unstable area.
Landslide mitigation measure by drainage arrangement needs regular maintenance of the drains
so that they do not become non-functional by clogging within a short time.
In rocky hillsides, the geometry of the slope and the geological structure of the rock play the
deciding role in planning drainage network. Water enters mainly through the joints or fi ssures in
rocks and develops pressure, initiating rock slides along weak structural planes. Hoek and Bray
(1981) have proposed placing selective shallow and sub-shallow drainages in the hillside to
prevent entry of water through the cracks in rocks and reduce water pressure in the immediate
vicinity of the potential breakage surface.
Shallow surface drains, especially at the top part
of hill slopes, help to divert surface run-off and

protection may also be provided in combination
with drainage arrangement (Fig. 21.24). In the

21.7.4 Slope Reinforcement
The work approach in soil reinforcement is basically done in two ways, which involve insertion
of reinforcement elements such as anchoring and nailing in the ground. It is then followed by
improvement of the mechanical character of slope material by consolidation or bonding by the
process of grouting with varied admixtures.
The anchoring technique is adopted to stabilize soil mass of failed slope or ground of impending
failure. The anchors increase the resistive force of the unstable ground mass to prevent failure
by driving forces. The ground slope is fi rst treated by

anchors are then inserted fairly deep into the ground

of soil for stabilization purposes. This measure is very
Concrete grip effective to contain the potential failure surface. Nails
are introduced in the ground by means of injecting
cement mortar at high speed. In another method,
steel nails are inserted perpendicular to the unstable
slope by screwing or percussion process. Steel plates

Grouting of the slope material is often done successfully to stabilize the ground of
unconsolidated materials. The grout mixture is chosen depending upon the nature of the
ground materials. In general, a grout of cement–water–bentonite with admixture of some
chemicals is injected into the ground mass at a high speed. The injected grout after setting
consolidates the slope providing high strength and prevents failure.
In rock slopes, the common methods of reinforcement of rock slopes are bolting and
shotcreting (Fig. 21.26). Bolting enhances binding and increases the shear strength of the
fi ssured rock. Shotcreting is done in rock surface by a hose at high speed with a view to
increasing the strength of the rock and thereby preventing rock falls.

21.7.5 Retaining Structures
By far, the common practice of protecting slope failures is to provide some kind of a retaining
structure to the slope surface. The nature of these structures depends on the resistive force to the

Landslide Evaluation and Mitigation ● 483
load imposed on the soil slope. Gravity retention structures used include masonry or stacked
masonry wall, concrete wall, rubble fi lled masonry wall, and rock-fi lled gabion wall (Fig. 21.27).
Of these, the stacked masonry walls of dimension stones (Fig. 21.28) at places with wire wrapping
and concrete walls are common. Weep holes are provided in many of the retaining walls to reduce
water pressure caused by infi ltration of rainwater through the slope surface.

to protect unstable soil slopes, cast in-situ

may affect human habitation including man-
made slopes due to rock fall or rock slides,
trenches are dug at the foothill or walls, and
fencing is constructed to trap fallen rock blocks
and boulders at the bottom part of rock slopes.
Boulders wrapped in wire nets are also placed
to create barriers to rock slides.

21.7.6 Other Methods of Soil Stabilization
In addition to the methods discussed here, thermal or freezing treatment and electro-osmosis
techniques are applied as stabilization measures in clayey earthen ground.
In the method of thermal or freezing treatment, the heating or cooling of the clayey soil increases
the shear strength of the material that helps to prevent surface creep. The success of this method,
however, depends on the nature of the materials and the topography including the ground slope.
The thermal treatment method has been successfully undertaken in foreign countries such as Russia
and Romania. The process involves burning of a liquid or gas with air introduced at depth in soil
through some boreholes. This causes solidifi cation of soil and decrease in its compressibility and
increase in strength. The high temperature (around 500°C) also changes the sensitive character of
clay minerals by making the soil non-expansive and thus helps the process of stabilization.
The electro-osmosis method involves dewatering of soil mass of the ground. The method involves
inserting two electrodes and passing current to enforce movement of the hydrous ions to cathode
from anode and thus improve the resistive force of soil by the removal of water (Section 5.9.2).
This method is, however, applicable only in homogenous clayey soil. In fact, the electro-osmosis
method of soil treatment brings about changes in the structure of the soil. The process of introducing
electric current is done by providing electrodes of certain electro-chemical composition that causes
Chapter_21.indd 483 10/27/2012 12:50:24 PM
484 ● Engineering Geology
deposition of the metal salt in the soil pores. Use of aluminium as anode gives good results in the
process of soil stabilization and the process is also known as electro-chemical hardening.
The modern methods used in land slope stabilization, namely nailing, use of geogrids,
cellular faces, coir geotextiles, and steel wire mesh, are important.
The fundamental principle of the soil nailing technique is mobilizing the intrinsic mechanical
character of the ground such as cohesion and angle of internal friction so that ground activity
collaborates with the stabilization work. Nailing, similar to anchoring, induces normal stress to the
advantage of stability. Nailing by rapid response diffuse called CLOUJET causes nails to embed
in the ground by means of an expanded bulb obtained by injecting mortar at high pressure into
the anchorage area. Another method known as soil nail and root technology (SNRT) introduces
steel nails very rapidly into a slope by percussion, vibration, or screw methods. This geotechnical
principle is claimed to have been effective in stabilizing soil slopes.
Geogrids are synthetic materials used to reinforce the ground. The insertion of geosynthetic
reinforcements, therefore, has the function of reinforcing the ground, conferring greater
stiffness and stability upon it and the capacity to be subjected to greater deformations without
reaching fracture points.
Cellular faces, also known as crib faces, are special supporting walls realized by means of
head grids prefabricated in reinforcement concrete or in wood. Compacted granular material is
inserted in the spaces of the grid. The characteristic modularity of the system confers notable
fl exibility of use in terms of adaptability to the morphology of the ground and because it does
not require any deep foundation other than laying a plane of lean concrete. Hence, this method
is useful in stabilizing the ground.
Coir geotextile is another method universally used for bioengineering and slope stabilization
because of the mechanical strength necessary to hold soil together. It has been proven that coir
geotextile lasts for only three to fi ve years, and when it degrades, it is converted to humus that
enriches soil.
Steel wire mesh is used for soil and rock slope stabilization. After levelling, the surface is
covered by a steel wire mesh, which is fastened to the slope and tensioned. It is a cost-effective
method of stabilization.
21.8 INSTANCES OF MAJOR LANDSLIDES IN INDIA
The Himalayan terrain being highly fragile, is a perennial source of landslides of all possible
descriptions, small to disastrous, very old to very recent. Other parts of the country such as the
north-eastern hilly region, the Western Ghats, the Nilgiris, the Eastern Ghats, and certain areas
of the Vindhyas are affected by intensive landslides almost every year, especially after heavy
precipitation during monsoon. This section discusses some among the large number of severe
landslides that affected various parts of the country in the past few decades.
With the onset of monsoon, heavy rains bring about large-scale landslides affecting many
localities of Sikkim and Darjeeling, including the national highway passing through these
Himalayan terrains (Fig. 21.29). The 1968 fl ood in parts of Darjeeling district in West Bengal
unleashed about 20,000 landslides covering vast areas of Sikkim and Darjeeling and killing
thousands of people. This incident of innumerable landslides spread over a period of three days
with precipitation of 500 mm to 1000 mm was an event of a 100-year return period. The effect
was so catastrophic that the 60 km-long stretch of the national highway passing through these
areas was seriously damaged by 92 major landslides and communication with the other parts of
the country was completely disrupted (Bhandari 2006).
Chapter_21.indd 484 10/27/2012 12:50:24 PM
Landslide Evaluation and Mitigation ● 485
The hilly areas of the north-eastern states
other than Sikkim and West Bengal, namely
Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, Nagaland, and
Arunachal Pradesh, have also suffered serious
landslide damages.
Excessive precipitation is responsible for
increase in water levels in lakes, streams,
canals, and reservoirs and results in fl oods that
change the groundwater condition and bring
about extensive landslides. At places, landslide
dams (dams created by the landslide itself by
depositing its debris) are created in the river
Fig. 21.29 Disruption of highway in Darjeeling by a valley, blocking the water fl ow by the debris of
huge landslide of hill slope after heavy rains and snow the fl ood-induced landslides. Many old slides
are reactivated by heavy and prolonged rains.
The Teesta valley in Sikkim and Darjeeling experiences a mean annual rainfall of 5000 mm
and suffers from repeated landslides almost every year. In Sikkim, the rainfall is associated
with cloudbursts. Cloudbursts may last for nearly three hours at a stretch causing devastating
landslides. Cloudbursts of intensities exceeding 1000 mm in 24 hours inevitably will trigger
large-scale mass movement.
In the South, landslides of severe nature are common during the rainy season along the steep
slopes of Western Ghats overlooking the Konkan valley. Landslides are also frequent in the
Nilgiris where many of the slides occur as debris avalanches consisting of soil and boulders. The
major landslides in Nilgiris are the Runnymede slide, the Glenmore slide, the Coonoor slide,
and the Karadipallan slide. These landslides caused enormous damage of land and property,
and even loss of lives. In the Nilgiris landslide during October–November 1978, as many as
90 people died. Kerala experienced several large landslides such as the Amboori landslide of
2001, which resulted in severe damage and the death of 23 people.
A landslide of unprecedented dimension and unique character was the Alakananda tragedy
of 1970 in Uttaranchal, which was due to the massive fl oods in the river Alakananda and
the breach of the landslide dam in its confl uence with the river Patalganga. In addition, a
300 km-long road consisting of calcareous quartzite and slate passing through the Alakananda
valley of Garhwal, east of Srinagar, has been badly affected by the landslides. In 1998, the
Malpa rock avalanche wiped out the entire Malpa village of Uttaranchal in Kumaun Himalaya
causing immense destruction, including killing of 220 people (BMTPC 2005).
Of all the causes responsible for the landslides and mass movement in India, the main reasons
include ground saturation by heavy rainfall, steep land slope, unfavourable rock attitudes, and
loose soil and bouldery deposits covering the hill slopes. Almost all major landslides occur during
monsoons (SW and NE monsoon) in the western fl ank of Western Ghats and during occasional
cyclonic events in the eastern fl ank indicating that the main triggering mechanism is the
oversaturation of overburden caused by heavy rains. Cloudburst phenomenon that brings about
heavy downpour within a short spell is another main cause of many of the catastrophic landslides.
Human activities are also responsible for landslides in many places. In hilly areas, slope
terracing is adopted mainly to prevent soil erosion and to enhance percolation during dry season
for crop cultivation. This causes blockage of natural drainage lines on slope surface for drainage
of excess storm water during heavy rains. This leads to oversaturation of soil and development
Chapter_21.indd 485 10/27/2012 12:50:24 PM
486 ● Engineering Geology
of pore pressure, resulting in slides of soil mass. Indiscriminate cutting of trees for timber and
domestic use for fuel as well as overgrazing are responsible for deforestation. Deforestation
in combination with a fragile geological environment is responsible for a large number of
landslides. Bhandari (2006) observed that vast areas of Sikkim, Kumaon, Garhwal, Himachal
Pradesh, Kashmir, and several other hilly regions have been robbed of the protective vegetal
cover to less than 30 per cent as against twice as much needed. The slopes without the vegetation
cover cannot hold soil cover, resulting in widespread erosion and initiating landslides.
21.9 CASE STUDY ON LANDSLIDES IN INDIA IN RECENT PAST
Landslides of devastating and destructive forms have been identifi ed in different parts of India
in places such as the north-eastern, eastern, and western Himalayas and the states of Tamil
Nadu, Assam, Sikkim, West Bengal, and Jammu and Kashmir.
Hilly areas with slopes containing weathered and decomposed rocks (regolith) and soil mass
are vulnerable to landslides. The mountainous areas of the Himalayas, Nilgiris, and Western
Ghats and also the hills of Sikkim and Darjeeling are subjected to considerable loss of human
lives in addition to loss of road and highways, landed properties, agricultural fi elds, and forests.
The following are some instances of devastating landslides of the recent past:
(i) 11–12 July 1996—A massive landslide in Jaldhaka valley and South Kalimpong hills
caused huge damage to properties and loss of lives.
(ii) 9 June 1997—Widespread devastation in Gangtok town disrupted communication along
the national highway in addition to causing damage of hill slopes and lands.
(iii) 18 August 1998—The major landslide of Malpa, Uttaranchal, led to the death of 220 people.
The entire hill slope with heterogeneous rock blocks moved down slope causing large-
scale destruction.
(iv) 7 July 1999—Kurseong town of North Bengal was devastated by severe landslide causing
heavy damage to the township.
(v) 8 October 2005—The Kashmir earthquake (described in Section 20.12) triggered 2400
landslides causing immense destruction and loss of lives. However, in addition to failed
slopes, numerous hill slopes developed features that facilitated water percolation leading
to landslides in subsequent years too.
(vi) 14–15 August 2007—The hilly areas of Himachal Pradesh were destroyed by a massive
landslide due to monsoon rains. In this catastrophic event, at least 62 people died in Dhara
village, 185 km from Shimla, due to monsoon cloudbursts. The calamity struck without
any warning when a huge mass of slush and rubble started moving down from uphill at an
altitude of 2700 m towards Dhara village at a terrifi c speed, wiping out everything on its
way and left a trail of misery. More than two-thirds of the population perished.
21.10 CASE STUDY ON MIZORAM LANDSLIDES (MUKHERJEE AND BHAGWAN 2009)
The landslide activity in Mizoram in north-eastern India, especially during monsoon, not only
creates frequent disturbances to the traffi c on National Highway 54 passing through this hilly
state, but also causes damage to buildings, culverts, roads, and cultivable and non-cultivated
hill slopes. Since 1996, a stretch of NH 54 has been facing continuous problems of subsidence,
creep, and landslides. In the same year, about 120 km stretch of the highway was severely
damaged by landslides and subsidence. It not only created problems for the moving vehicles,
but also enhanced further risk of failure of the hill slopes of the area.
Chapter_21.indd 486 10/27/2012 12:50:24 PM
Landslide Evaluation and Mitigation ● 487
Hence, a detailed investigation related to the causes of the slides and subsidence was carried
out by the scientists of the Central Road Research Institute and suggestions were forwarded for
their remediation. This extract is based on their work and suggestions for remedial measures.
The major portions of the road including the affected areas of slide and subsidence consist of
alternate layers of slate, shale, and sandstone. Severe tectonic activities on the rock formations
caused intense fracturing of these rocks. The fragile and fragmented rocks are visible almost
everywhere. Because of the highly weak and unstable condition of the strata, landslides are
very frequent along the road and its neighbouring areas. In 1996, even after taking up certain
corrective measures, the situation of slide disturbance did not improve. In 2003, in addition
to the highway, many shops and houses by the roadside were completely damaged during the
monsoon. The problems of sinking of road and sliding of hill slopes were so intensive that
traffi c movement along the entire highway had to be stopped.
After thorough geological investigation of the highway and the surrounding areas, it was
found that the fi ner components of the rock formations are composed of silt and clay. Highly
decomposed shale is the dominating rock type in the area, which formed clay after weathering
and decomposition. Joint planes are highly sheared and have no cohesion. In many places, the
sedimentary beds are folded and fragmented forming innumerable planes of discontinuity, which
have enhanced the chance of slides. The rocks are actually subjected to wedge-type failures.
Huge piles of fragmented and disintegrated blocks resulted from the failures accumulated in
different parts of the roads. Shear testing of the materials under slide indicated very low shear
strength (35 kPa) and angle of internal friction (30°).
After thorough geotechnical investigation of the landslide and subsidence situation, the following
remedial measures have been mainly suggested to prevent the recurrence of the problems:
(i) Plugging of all existing potholes on the shoulder portions of the road
(ii) Sealing of the tension cracks
(iii) Construction of side drains along the roads and culverts
(iv) Provision of proper arrangements for surface drains and feeder drains
(v) Provision of step-like chutes by the roadside besides the drains
(vi) Construction of heavy and light retaining structures such as masonry walls, wire crate
walls, drum retaining structures, bamboo crate walls, perforated tin sheets, and log
retaining structures to protect the unstable and affected locations
(vii) Piling of bamboo, installing of lime-column benching, and erosion control by vegetation
using jute or coir geogrid mantle
(viii) Proper maintenance of the retaining structures

22.1 INTRODUCTION
Dam and reservoir projects in limestone might face the problem of competency of
reservoir due to the formation of large surface and underground caverns through
which the entire reservoir water may drain to a lower valley. Chemical and radioactive
studies can evaluate whether the reservoir water under storage condition is likely to
cause large-scale leakage. This chapter deals with such practical problems related to
karstic limestone reservoir and their solution, which includes providing deep grout
curtain along the periphery of the reservoirs. It also provides a short case history of
such problems in different countries of the world and describes the extent of grout
curtain provided to arrest leakage.
22.2 SOLUBILITY OF LIMESTONE AND FORMATION OF KARST
The word karst is derived from the ‘Karst’ region located in the Adriatic coast of
Slovenia where the landform is characterized by excessive erosion and the presence
of numerous surface and subsurface caverns in limestone. Karst topography
generally develops in humid climate and in areas consisting of limestone and other
soluble rocks. A combination of erosion of country rock by acidic groundwater
and mass wasting by sinkholes (deep caves) is responsible for creation of karst
topography.
Chapter_22.indd 490 10/18/2012 5:29:14 PM
Karstic Terrain Investigation ● 491
The sinkholes and caverns are formed by the solution action of water on limestone. Limestone is
only slightly soluble in pure water, but when the water is charged with carbon dioxide, solubility
increases manifold. Rainwater when it absorbs some carbon dioxide from the atmosphere forms
carbonic acid. When the acidic water falls on a terrain consisting of limestone, it can dissolve
the rock effectively because of chemical reaction between calcium carbonate of the bedrock
(limestone) and carbonic acid of meteoric water. The chemical reaction can be expressed as
follows:
CO ++HH22 (cid:2) H CCOO (Carbonic acid)
2 O 2 3
H CCOO + CaCO (cid:2) CCaa((HHCCOO ) (Calcium bicarbonate)
2 3 3 3 2
The dissolved portion of limestone forms calcium bicarbonate and the remaining insoluble
material in limestone will be carried away by the moving water and deposited elsewhere.
The rainwater that percolates down and then moves as underground water is generally
charged with carbon dioxide derived from the uppermost soil zone. Carbon dioxide in the
soil zone exerts on the water passing through it a pressure that is several hundred times more
than that exerted by carbon dioxide in the atmospheric air. The solubility of limestone by
groundwater subjected to such conditions will be increased manifold. As a result, a network
of underground channels and caves is formed that contributes enormously to the subterranean
drainage system.
Solution is not the only factor in the formation of limestone cavities. Corrosion and
mechanical erosion also play a signifi cant role. The debris accumulated in the cavity fl oor
by mechanical erosion or corrosion of the carbonate rock still contains many soluble salts.
The rainwater entering through the openings in limestone widens the openings by dissolving
the side walls and then in course of its onward movement through the cavity fl oor leaches the
soluble salts in the accumulated debris. As the process of solution, corrosion, and leaching
continues simultaneously, the openings enlarge to give rise to big solution cavities.
The solubility of limestone is dependent on its chemical purity, but in many limestone
reservoirs, the chemical purity of limestone is found to be unimportant for the creation of caves.
More cavities may be formed in impure limestone as the insoluble content goes into suspension
after dissolution begins. Extensive development of caverns in many of the project sites containing
dense and massive limestone is not uncommon,

22.3 SURFACE AND SUBSURFACE FORMS OF LIMESTONE CAVERNS
Caverns or caves in limestone are found to occur in various sizes and shapes on the earth’s
surface or at depths. In general, it is possible to easily enter into these caves. On the basis of
their location, the limestone caverns may be classifi ed into two groups, namely surface caverns
and subsurface caverns. Surface caverns exist in the exposed parts of limestone formation
and extend downwards such that one can easily enter them. Subsurface caverns occur in
the underground region of karstic limestone extending for long distances such as tunnels or
channels and have outlets at the ground surface.
22.3.1 Surface Caverns—Sinkholes and Swallow Holes
Limestone caverns observed on the surface,
commonly called sinkholes or swallow holes,
provide path for rainwater to move downwards.
These are generally formed along the joints,
especially at the junction of two intersecting joints.
Most of the surface forms of caverns are seen to
be nearly vertical or inclined openings and extend
very deep to a long distance in the subsurface
region with the outlet at the surface (Fig. 22.2).
These sinkholes or cavities are partially fi lled
with clay or debris carried from the top by the
percolating water. They form networks of deep
cavities by widening the openings of intersecting
Fig. 22.2 Large sinkholes in limestone connected
with subsurface solution channels sets of joints. In karstic limestone terrain, large
circular to semicircular cavities that are several
tens of metres in diameter and even giant valley-shaped depressions may be formed. The giant
cavities and depressions are generally the result of` collapse or subsidence of roof of underground
cavities and later erosion by percolating surface water.
22.3.2 Subsurface Caverns—Solution Channels or Tunnels
Subsurface caverns occur as conduits or channels and are termed solution channel, solution
tunnel, or subterranean channel. During summer months, a small quantity of water may fl ow
through them or they may remain dry, but during monsoon season, rainwater from the surface
fl ows into the subsurface channels. These channels or tunnels may be of varied dimensions
from a fraction of a metre to tens of metres in diameter or height.
The caverns may be triangular, semicircular, near-circular, rectangular, or irregular in cross
section. Many of them are constricted at some places but are of huge dimensions in other areas.
These variations in dimensions are attributed to the chemical purity or impurity of limestone,
structural features, and velocity and extent of water fl ow through the rock.
Presence of argillaceous matter in limestone, intersection of two or more sets of joints,
occurrence of shear or fault zones, steep gradient of the surface of water fl ow, and so on also
add to the cavity formation activity resulting in the huge dimensions of the cavity. In the
Kopili project of Meghalaya, cavities in limestone vary from a fraction of a metre to as large
as 20 m in diameter. During construction of a dam project (Kruscica project) of Croatia in
limestone, a cavity as large as 50 m long, 30 m high, and 25 m wide was found at a depth of
50 m below the ground surface.

Karstic Terrain Investigation ● 493
22.3.3 Stalactites and Stalagmites
Stalactite and stalagmite are two typical features found in many subsurface limestone caverns.
Dissolution of limestone by percolating water through faults, joints, and fractures in rock and
its dripping and deposition in the form of crystalline calcium carbonate are responsible for the
formation of these features (Fig. 22.3). If calcium carbonate crystals hang like icicles from the
roof of the cavern (‘St’ in Fig. 22.3), they are called stalactites (Fig. 22.4). The pillar-, conical,
or hump-shaped mass of calcium carbonate that grows as a ridge after deposition of the mineral
on the fl oor of the cavern is called stalagmite (‘Sm’ in Fig. 22.3). The subsurface limestone
channels that occur like tunnels following zigzag paths are formed by solvent action along the
joints or other weak planes such as faults.

and F–F, fault plane) limestone formation of Kopili project
Some authors believe that solution cavities may be formed below the water table or
piezometric surface of groundwater (Davis and Dewist 1966). For instance, the Hales Bar dam
in the US that failed after construction was found to have several large cavities in the zone
of saturation below the dam foundation. Though the overall observations suggest that cavity
formation may take place at any level, in most of the projects, maximal karstifi cation is found
to be limited to the upper 30 m to 60 m zones.
A channel or tunnel type of subsurface cavity may be several kilometres long. These are
mostly connected by many subsidiary channels similar to the surface streams having several
tributaries. Some subsurface cavities may also form labyrinths, which contain complicated
series of paths through which it is very diffi cult to fi nd the way. So, while moving along a long
tunnel or channel to investigate it, some markings by paints are to be made for identifi cation
of the return route. The fl oors of the subsurface solution channels generally contain deposits of
pebbles, sand, silt, and clay of varying thicknesses.
22.4 SPELEOLOGICAL AND OTHER METHODS OF EVALUATION OF KARSTIC CONDITION
A karst aquifer is a carbonate aquifer where groundwater fl ow mainly occurs through bedding
strata, fractures, conduits, and caverns created by and/or enlarged by limestone dissolution. It is
important to study the scientifi c nature, geology, and biological aspects of caverns. Subsurface
information can also be obtained by exploratory drilling which gives the ideas of joints, faults,
and shear zones. The following sub-sections details out some common methodologies.

22.4.1 Speleological Study
Speleology is the scientifi c study of physical, geological, and biological aspects of caverns. The
investigation of surface and subsurface caverns in karst area including mapping and exploration
of subterranean caves and solution channels comes under the purview of speleology. In a project
area with karst topography, aerial photographic study is undertaken at the fi rst instance to fi nd
the accurate locations and characteristics of the various cavities or sinkholes of the project area.
Individual cavities are then studied by fi eld traverses. A large-scale geological map of the area is
prepared plotting all the cavities, giving numbers to each of them, and recording their dimensions
and other characteristics. Many of the observed caverns of the surface are extended to subsurface
region and these are in fact inlets or outlets of big underground channel- or tunnel-type cavities.
The most strenuous but important part of speleologic study for engineering geological
purposes is the underground survey of the cavities including geological mapping of the
subsurface solution channels. In most cases, this involves clearing of the clogged materials
or debris in the interior parts of the cavities for free movement. Lighting arrangement in the
underground caverns is necessary for a clear view of the cavities for survey. A torchlight
powered by at least four cells each of 2.5 volts may serve the purpose. A 50 m-long measuring
survey tape and a Brunton compass or clinometer are required to record and plot the rock
types, joints including their attitudes, cavity dimensions, nature of debris, and other subsurface
features along the channel route. The distance and direction of the different features of the
solution channel are measured starting from the inlet (taking it as zero point) when proceeding
along the channel until its outlet end is reached, or as far as one can approach. Preparing a
sketch of subsurface geological features and noting the height or diameter of the cavity at
certain intervals are to be done in the fi eld diary. Care should be taken to ensure that the sketch
and writing in the notebook are not spoiled by water dripping from the roof of the cave.
A geological map and geological section are then prepared for the subsurface channel from
the data obtained from subsurface survey of the cavities (Figs 22.5 and 22.6). In a reservoir
project of karstic area, such study of the large subterranean solution channels is extremely
helpful to fi nd their pattern and identify possible leakage path under impounded condition of
the reservoir. While working in the subsurface cavities, it may be interesting to note that insects
and small fi sh, living inside the caves or solution channels where light cannot penetrate, are
blind with protruding eyes (personal experience of this author). Many subsurface cavities may
have a stinking smell as they become the abode of a large number of bats.

22.4.2 Geophysical Study
Geophysical study is an effective method to determine the subsurface nature of limestone
and presence of cavities, if any, in a reservoir area of karstic terrain. In general, electrical
resistivity method is followed to fi nd the ‘anomalies’ that may be due to the presence of
cavities. Gravity survey method is also applied to investigate the limestone terrain for detecting
subsurface cavities by comparing density anomalies of rock at different depths. A few test
holes are, however, required to be drilled at the places of anomalies detected through these two
geophysical methods of investigation (Chapter 11) to prove their presence in the subsurface.
Temperature logging conducted through some boreholes with the help of sensitive
temperature measuring instrument is another geophysical method of fi nding the possible
presence of subsurface cavity. A fall of temperature from one level to another in the subsurface
region is indicative of differential movement of water in limestone formation, which is possible
only from circulation of cooler water in comparison to surrounding areas with connection to
surface water through subsurface cavities.
22.4.3 Exploration by Drilling
Most of the important subsurface information is obtained from exploratory drill holes covering
the limestone strata inside and along the rim of a reservoir. The rock cores obtained from
drilling give an idea of the nature of joints, faults, and shear zones including their frequency
of occurrence, presence of scouring action, and cavity formation along the fracture planes.
Percolation test is carried out through each of the holes drilled at every 3 m intervals. Any
excessive leakage or non-development of pressure after using packer is indicative of the presence
of void space or cavities through which leakage takes place. Sometimes, an inclined drill hole,
instead of a vertical drill hole, provides more chance of cutting across subsurface cavities.
Engineering geologists should apply their knowledge of surface and subsurface conditions to
identify the locations of drill holes in a limestone terrain.
The drill holes are used for measurement of water level throughout the year to provide a
critical view of the fl uctuating water level during dry and wet seasons. Like other sedimentary
rocks (e.g., sandstone), limestone may not contain groundwater with regular slope. The
piezometric surface (generally undulating in nature) is prepared plotting the water level data
to obtain the overall downgradient direction of the subsurface fl ow. It is to be remembered that
the topography or dip of limestone beds is not a criterion to fi nd the down slope direction of
piezometric surface. In a reservoir project, an intrabasin down slope direction is not harmful,
Chapter_22.indd 495 10/18/2012 5:29:16 PM
496 ● Engineering Geology
but if the downgradient is towards the lower valley, the fact is to be considered with other
evidence (Section 15.6) for probable leakage from the reservoir to adjacent lower valley.
22.5 CHEMICAL AND RADIOACTIVE TRACER STUDY OF RESERVOIRS
The most important study carried out in a karstic terrain to determine the competency of
reservoirs is the tracer study. The main objectives of the tracer study are to establish local
connections among the several sinkholes and cavities located inside the reservoir area and
to obtain direct evidence of interconnection of subsurface channels from reservoir to lower
valley. If the condition of local connections prevails in a reservoir basin, it is considered to be
benefi cial to the reservoir as it provides extra space to store more water. However, the condition
of interconnection to lower valley causes leakage when water is impounded in the reservoir
basin. If the tracer study indicates that the clusters of locally connected cavities are joined
with the interconnected subsurface channels with lower valley, it poses the serious problem of
leakage of reservoir water under the water-impounded condition.
The material used as tracer may be a chemical or radioactive substance. The chemicals are of
varied nature, the most common being the common salt. In addition, a fl uorescent colour dye or
a chemical such as potassium dichromate (Geological Survey of India’s preparation) is also used.
22.5.1 Chemical Tracer Study
A solution of common salt, or fl uorescent colour dye (e.g., rhodamine, a commercial product),
or potassium dichromate is introduced through the cavities and also through the drill holes of
the reservoir areas soon after some rain in the area when the cavities are fi lled with plenty of
water. The quantity of the substance to be used needs to be judged based on the length of the
travel path. From actual application, it can be said that the quantity of chemicals to be used for
a 1–5 km travel path should be 40–100 kg of common salt, or 2–10 kg of the dye, or 3–30 kg
of potassium dichromate.
The chemicals are to be diluted with water before pouring into the cavity or drill holes. After
introducing the chemical tracers, samples are to be collected at every 6–12 h intervals from
selected points in the lower valley (or from cavities and drill holes) for a period of 15 days to
2 months. The samples are to be tested both qualitatively and quantitatively for the common
salt and only quantitatively for potassium dichromate. Even if traces of the latter, as low as
0.001ppm, are present in water, it exhibits a pink colour in the presence of diphenylcarbazide
dissolved in acetone. Rhodamine will exhibit a reddish tint when seen with naked eye and
fl uorescence under a fl uoroscope even after dilution to a great extent.
22.5.2 Radioactive Tracer Study
When the chemical tracer test does not provide any fruitful result, radioactive tracer study
is undertaken, which includes the use of environmental tritium in groundwater and injecting
tritium through drill holes. It is postulated that tests of thermonuclear weapons create a source
of natural tritium in groundwater. If groundwater mixed with tritium moves from a higher
valley to a lower valley, the older water will be found in the lower valley and the recent water in
the upper valley. Thus, testing of the environmental tritium in the groundwater provides a clue
to understand the possibility of leakage from a reservoir.
In the other method, a very small amount of tritium-loaded heavy water is injected into
the boreholes within the reservoir area. Sampling of water is done at regular intervals from
Chapter_22.indd 496 10/18/2012 5:29:16 PM
Karstic Terrain Investigation ● 497
the drill holes in the reservoir periphery and from the springs and seepages in rocks of lower
valley adjacent to the reservoir. The samples are tested using sophisticated spectrometer to
identify whether they contain tritium-bearing water, and if present, the travelling speed is
calculated from the time of sampling and that of injection. The data provides information on the
possibility of free fl ow of reservoir water including the rate of movement. The radioactive tracer
study was undertaken in India in collaboration with the atomic scientists at the Tata Institute of
Fundamental Research (Gangopadhyay 1970).
22.6 CONSTRUCTION OF DAMS AND RESERVOIRS IN KARSTIC LIMESTONE
The engineering geologist working on dam and reservoir projects in a karstic terrain needs
to take up a thorough investigation with respect to the competency of the reservoir. The mere
presence of cavities in limestone does not mean that the project cannot be undertaken. In
fact, many dam and reservoir projects could be constructed on karstic limestone. However,
there are also instances of many failures. The geological conditions may be different in
different places. Available record of projects constructed on limestone reveals that most of
them experienced the threat of leakage, and very extensive and expensive treatment had to
be undertaken. In many projects, the dam is located on cavernous limestone wherein the
problem of treatment is restricted to the dam site and abutments. However, if the reservoir
area consists of cavernous limestone likely to cause leakage, it may involve expensive
treatment to contain the leakage.
It is the duty of the engineering geologist to reveal all the features of the caverns and
study their behaviour to assess the seriousness of the problems that may arise under reservoir
condition. In many cases, the cavities that are vulnerable to leakage of reservoir water can be
treated successfully to prevent leakage. The main method of treatment is the grouting of the
cavernous limestone along the reservoir rim to arrest the path of leakage to the lower valley.
One or two rows of drill holes for grouting purposes are taken up at close intervals covering
the entire cavernous limestone bed at depth. The purpose is to seal the voids in limestone.
Effi cacy of grouting is examined by post-grouting pumping test. If the test indicates that
the percolation of water is negligible, the grouting undertaken is considered satisfactory to
contain leakage.
Case histories of dams and reservoir projects in cavernous limestone show that most of these
projects in different parts of the world have faced utmost diffi culty during their construction
on account of adverse geological situations related to the presence of subsurface cavities.
Extensive treatment had to be taken up to overcome the diffi culties. In several cases, the dam
and reservoir sites had to be shifted in favour of geologically better sites, and in some cases, the
reservoir projects had to be abandoned due to the threat of uncontrollable leakage. Section 22.7
presents a brief account of the karstic limestone problems faced by several countries and the
treatment undertaken to contain the leakage.
22.7 INSTANCES OF KARSTIC LIMESTONE PROBLEMS AND REMEDIAL MEASURES
This section discusses the problems associated with karstic limestone in some projects
undertaken in India and other countries and their remedial measures.
22.7.1 Projects in India
This subsection discusses a few projects undertaken in karstic limestone terrain in India.
Chapter_22.indd 497 10/18/2012 5:29:16 PM
498 ● Engineering Geology
Kopili hydroelectric project, Meghalaya
The Kopili hydroelectric project in eastern India consists of tertiary limestone capped by shale
and underlain by sandstone deposited on Precambrian gneissic basement. A vast area covering
the Kopili and Umrong reservoir basins and the lowermost Langlai valley is characterized by
exposed limestone. The project is aimed at harnessing the power potential of the river Kopili by
constructing a large dam across it, storing water in the Kopili and Umrong basins, and carrying
the water through a long tunnel to obtain a drop of nearly 400 m.
During the investigation stage, study of aerial photographs revealed the presence of nearly
200 and 150 sinkholes in the Kopili and Umrong reservoir basins, respectively. Exploratory
drill holes in the two reservoir areas followed by water percolation tests proved the presence
of caverns at varying depths, the top 40 m of limestone formation being the worst-affected part
with large solution channels. Chemical and radioactive tracer studies conducted in the reservoir
basins indicated possible leakage under storage condition. From the overall investigation result,
it was concluded that the limestone of the reservoir area is highly cavernous and liable to
cause leakage. Hence, an altogether new project scheme had to be planned changing the earlier
scheme, which involved shifting the dam site from limestone to granite terrain nearly one
kilometre downstream and proposing to construct the project in two phases to avoid the risk of
reservoir leakage.
Obra dam project, Uttar Pradesh
The 23 m-high Obra dam in Uttar Pradesh constructed for hydroelectric power generation
rests on Kajrahat limestone and shale of Lower Vindhyan formation. A part of the reservoir in
the vicinity of the dam consisting of Kajrahat limestone (bed L-1) had posed the problem of
leakage from the reservoir. Another highly cavernous limestone bed (bed L-2) that occurs in
many places of the reservoir spread was also prone to leakage of reservoir water. Structurally,
the limestone bed L-1 being in the synclinal part of the regional fold had enhanced the problem
of leakage.
In the dam and the river bed section, leakage of the reservoir water through the cavernous
limestone was controlled by providing positive cut-off extended to the underlying impervious
shale bed-2. The cut-off alignment passes through the carbonaceous shale bed-1 after
intercepting the limestone bed L-2, which was treated with concrete plugs followed by curtain
grouting. In addition, two lines of concrete diaphragm were provided at 3 m intervals for a
length of 365 m through the river deposit. Curtain grouting was also undertaken for a length of
475 m along the cut-off alignment and below the concrete diaphragm to seal the leakage path
through the cavernous limestone including its faulted contact with Archaean basement.
The cavernous character of the limestone bed L-1 was treated by curtain grouting over its
entire thickness and the consumption of cement–bentonite mix used in the grout was of the order
of 900 kg/m. In the treatment of the clay-fi lled caverns of the spillway and powerhouse sites,
the clay was removed and the cavities were then fi lled with concrete followed by consolidation
grouting in the limestone foundation zone to a depth of 3–4 m. In addition, curtain grouting was
carried out to a depth of 15 m extending up to the impervious shale bed so as to seal the leakage
path in cavernous limestone. The grout intake was up to 184 kg/m.
22.7.2 Projects in Karstic Limestone in Other Parts of the World
This section discusses a few projects undertaken in karstic limestone in various parts of the
world.

Karstic Terrain Investigation ● 499
USA
Logan Martin dam This is a multipurpose project developing part of the river Coosa in
Alabama. The dam site consists of Precambrian dolomite limestone with numerous caverns.
This involved elaborate treatment by grouting. The total depth taken together of the grout holes
were 46,200 m and consumed as much as 84,400 m3 of cement grout.
The Hondo reservoir This reservoir located in New Mexico is situated on cavernous
limestone capped by thick soil. The water table lies at a depth of about 60 m. After the reservoir
was constructed, large cavities (voids) were developed in the soil through which large-scale
leakage started rapidly. The loss of water was so great that the reservoir was abandoned.
Hales Bar project Of all the projects constructed under the Tennessee Valley Authority in the
US, the Hales Bar project constructed on cavernous limestone caused the maximum trouble. On
account of excessive leakage beneath the dam, it took eight years to complete the project. Soon
after the dam completion, heavy leakage started. It took almost 30 years to contain the leakage
to a considerable extent by elaborate and expensive treatment.
Norris dam The foundation and abutments of this dam are constituted of cavernous limestone.
The caverns posed serious leakage hazards and necessitated extensive and systematic treatment
(by grouting) covering a stretch of 930 m of the abutments and foundation area. Each of the
grout holes penetrated as deep as 100 m to120 m.
Canada
Manitoba hydroelectric project The project area including the reservoir is characterized by
cavernous limestone, which posed the problem of leakage of stored water after the construction
of the project. To prevent the leakage, 30 km-long grout curtain along the entire reservoir
periphery had to be provided at a prohibitive cost. The estimated cost of providing grout curtain
was as much as $140 million in the 1960s.
Croatia
In Yugoslavia, several dam projects, namely Liverovice, Peruca, Moste, Zvornik, Senj,
Trebisnjica, Buskobalato, and Kruscica, were built on karstic limestone with the help of
extensive grouting. During construction of the Kruscica project, a big ponor (cavity) 55 m long,
30 m high, and 25 m wide was discovered about 50 m below the right abutment. This involved
a change in the design of the dam. The 70 m-high proposed arch dam had to be changed to a
rock-fi ll dam.
France
The Chambon dam on Triassic limestone, the Santest dam on Lias limestone, the St. Pierre
Cognet dam on Upper Lias limestone, the Castilian dam on Jurassic limestone, the Chaudonune
dam on Lias limestone, and the Genissiat dam on Cretaceous limestone encountered problems
of leakage due to the cavernous character of the limestone. The caverns were treated by very
expensive grouting. The grout intake in different dam projects was as much as 137 to 520 kg/m.
Turkey
May dam founded on karstic Mesozoic limestone and Neogene marl was completed in 1960 but
it did not hold water. The reservoir area is covered with 15 to 20 m-thick alluvium. The reservoir
water seeps into the alluvium and disappears in the karstic limestone. To arrest leakage, the
Chapter_22.indd 499 10/18/2012 5:29:16 PM

observed sinkholes and caverns in limestone were packed with impermeable materials, but
several new caverns were then developed and the leakage could not be fully contained.
Iraq
Docan dam and reservoir The foundation area consists of Cretaceous limestone, marl, and
shale. Extensive curtain grouting had to be carried out along the reservoir rim and in the dam
foundation. The grout curtain covered 420,665 m3 of limestone with the total length of the
boreholes 193,185 m. The total cement consumption was 45,000 tonnes and cost £240,000 in
1959.
Italy
Val Gallina dam is located on Upper Trias dolomite limestone. To prevent leakage, large-
scale grouting was undertaken, which resulted in a grout intake of 950 kg/m. Fedaia dam was
constructed in 1956 on limestone and tuff and extensive grouting had to be undertaken. Even
so, excessive leakage through the caverns in limestone continued for decades.
Algeria
In Fodda dam and reservoir project spread over the Jurassic limestone, the dam foundation was
found to be highly fi ssured and full of caverns. It necessitated shifting of the site to a different
place. In the new location too, very expensive treatment had to be carried out in the fi ssured
limestone. In the Beni–Bahdel dam project, the foundation area consisted of Jurassic limestone.
With the completion of the project, leakage started at rates between 500 and 1000 l/s. Extensive
grouting had to be undertaken to control the leakage to suffi cient extent.

Guidelines for Writing an
Engineering Geology Report
LEARNING OBJECT IVES
After studying this chapter, the reader will be familiar with the following:
• Purpose of preparing an engineering • Fieldwork required for collecting basic
geology report data to include in the report
• Procedure for writing an engineering • Utility of in-fi eld preparation of report
geology report draft
23.1 INTRODUCTION
A professional, either from the discipline of geology or engineering, after the
completion of engineering geology work in a project site, submits a report on the
work to the project authority. This chapter discusses the objective of writing such
a report and the data that needs to be incorporated in it so that it serves the best
purpose of planning and design of the engineering project. The report generally
starts with a brief account of the project features followed by the morphology and
geology of the area with special emphasis on the geological problems of the site
and their solutions. The site plan showing the project features, geological map, and
cross sections along with the laboratory test results on the engineering properties of
materials including rocks of the site need to be submitted with the report.
23.2 OBJECTIVE OF AN ENGINEERING GEOLOGY REPORT
The objective of preparing an engineering geology report is to communicate the
geological condition of a site to the concerned authority of the state or central
government or to the private concern that deployed the services of engineering
geologists to investigate the site. Engineering geology reports are mostly required
for civil engineering projects with the object of providing information on the
surface and subsurface geological conditions of the project sites. The information
given with recommendation in a report helps in the preparation of design of the
engineering structure and its safe construction.
In addition, engineering geology reports are required on natural hazards such
as earthquakes, tsunamis, and landslides to reveal their causes and recommend
remediation methods to the government authorities. When a stretch of a highway
Chapter_23.indd 503 10/18/2012 5:30:01 PM
504 ● Engineering Geology
or a part of a communication system is affected by landslides, an engineering geology report
is of immediate importance for suggesting measures for arresting the slides and restoring the
communication system at the earliest.
The importance of preparing an engineering geology report with comprehensive data cannot
be overstressed. In fact, engineering geologists are involved in investigating various types of
geology-dependent problems and reporting to the concerned authorities, providing suggestions
to solve the problems. The report carries specifi c information on the practical aspects of geology
covering the stability of site and weak geological features and recommendation for improvement
of site conditions. Engineers need the report for proper understanding of geological defects so
that the design can be made with cost estimate for remedial measures.
23.3 BASIC ASPECTS
In the book Application of Geology to Engineering Practice (Berkeley 1950), special stress
was laid on the importance of writing engineering geology reports in simple language so that
the report is easily comprehensible to engineers. This holds good even today.
The work of an engineering geologist will not be appreciated if it is not easily understood by
engineers because of the use of high-sounding geological terms or its manner of presentation.
Attewell and Farmer (1976) also observed that ‘the most important part of the investigation
report (engineering geological) will be the actual results clearly and objectively presented.’
In fact, report writing is the most vital part of the activities of an engineering geologist. The
report must fulfi l the requirement of the engineers. The data in the report should be exhaustive
and the manner of reporting should be such that it can serve the desired purpose of the engineers
without any further inquiry.
The engineering geology report may be written using engineering terms wherever
applicable. In principle, the report should be clear and concise, but at the same time it
should carry all essential geotechnical data related to the work or project site. Depending
upon the engineering need, the report may carry a short description of the morphology of
an area, but detailed description of the geology and comprehensive data on soil and rock
properties in quantitative terms are necessary for cost-effective design and safe construction
of the project.
An engineering geologist may investigate a project site by a single visit working in the fi eld
for a short time and then report on specifi c geological problems. However, all major engineering
works are done in different phases such as preliminary phase, design phase, and construction
phase, and the engineering geologist’s association with the work of a major engineering project
is required from its beginning until the completion of the construction. At the end of the fi eld
investigation for an engineering project, the geologist submits a report to fulfi l the engineering
needs for each phase of the work.
23.4 GEOLOGICAL INPUTS
The title of the report should refl ect whether it is of preliminary, feasibility, or construction
stage work. The type of the project, whether dam site, tunnel alignment, and so on, should also
be known from the title. Next to the title comes the abstract, which highlights the nature of the
project under investigation and the engineering geological work undertaken.
After the abstract, the report starts with an introduction which states the location and salient
features of the project, the aims and objectives, or the purpose, and the nature of investigation.
Chapter_23.indd 504 10/18/2012 5:30:02 PM
Guidelines for Writing an Engineering Geology Report ● 505
The introduction of the report should clearly bring out the stages or phases of investigation for
all major engineering works. This is followed by the main aspects, namely the descriptive parts
of site geology.
The description of any matter comes under a meaningful heading. For example, under
subsurface geology, the geological features interpreted or studied from exploratory drilling
or geophysical investigations are described in detail. In the very early stage of work involving
selection of a site out of two or more alternative sites given by the engineers, the merits and
demerits of all the given sites are described in the report and then the best possible site for
engineering construction based on geotechnical consideration is suggested.
The salient features of the alternative sites are also presented in a tabular form highlighting
the superiority of the selected site over the others. A report ends with one or two paragraphs
dealing on conclusion and recommendation.
The presence of any adverse geological condition at the site under investigation needs to
be described in suffi cient detail to give a clear understanding of its role in the foundation of
the engineering structure and the measures to be adopted to overcome the adverse geology.
Suppose a fault traverses the foundation of a heavy structure; mere reporting about its presence
in the foundation is not suffi cient for an engineering design. The report must clearly bring
out its signifi cance mentioning that it is a weak feature and is likely to create a problem of
subsidence or differential settlement as may be the case under stress of the structure.
The report should also discuss the details of such a weak feature such as the length, width,
and depth of affected stretch due to the fault including its position and orientation with respect
to the engineering structure and the nature of treatment necessary. Such details help engineering
design to include the cost of treatment.
It is very important to present the fi eld observations in an intelligent way. All observational
facts mentioned in the report should be meaningful and related to the problems of the engineering
structure proposed for construction. If presented with maps and tables, the observed features
and data of fi eld measurements become more meaningful than when provided mere description.
Such data must be presented in the report along with maps, cross section, graphs, and diagrams
to facilitate engineers to prepare their report on the design of the structure.
When provided with illustrative maps, sections, and tables, the subject matter of the report
is easily understandable and can be utilized by the engineer for structural design. For example,
contoured geological map and geological cross section, submitted with an engineering geology
report, are essential for the engineering design of structures such as dams, tunnels, and
powerhouses.
As far as practicable, the descriptions of fi eld observations should be supported by factual
evidence and quantitative data. The results of soil or rock laboratory tests are to be presented
in a tabular form and graphs with a site plan showing sampling sites. While mentioning about
subsoil or rock condition, it is necessary to submit a cross section showing the geological
features at depths. In the description of subsurface hydrology, providing simple numerical
data in case of water table may not give the true picture of its place of existence. It becomes
more meaningful if it is shown in a geological cross section drawn along the boreholes used to
measure water table.
The core logs of drill holes are also to be presented schematically in log charts (Section 11.7,
Figs 11.21 and 11.11). Submission of a large sheet of fi eld data is not desirable. Instead, graphs,
cross sections, and so on prepared from the bulk data with suitable scale may be submitted with
the report.

506 ● Engineering Geology
The broad guidelines followed by engineering geologists of GSI in writing reports for
different stages of civil engineering works including the types of information to be furnished in
these reports are enumerated in Section 23.5.
23.5 REPORTS FOR DIFFERENT PHASES OF SITE INVESTIGATION
Reports are mainly created during the three phases—Planning phase, Design phase, and
Construction phase. Depending on the project features, physiology and feasibility of the project,
planning phase reports cover the suitability of the proposed site from geotechnical considerations.
It is always advisable to include a recommendation while preparing planning stage reports
as it helps with decision-making. If the project is in design phase, details of expansive soil
including the area of its occurrence are elaborated. For construction phase reports, notes written
by the resident geologist on the geological features should highlight immediate attention of the
engineers for construction purposes involving treatment of weak zones. It is to be noted that the
details of geological defects observed and suggestions given for their corrective measures are the
most important aspects to be included in any construction stage report.
23.5.1 Planning Phase Report
The following are the points to be noted when submitting an engineering geology report in the
planning phase:
• State briefl y the project features supplemented by a contour plan showing the location of
the site or different sites under the project.
• Provide a short description of the physiology, regional geology, and site geology including
major geological structures of the area.
• Include available small-scale geological map of the area or that made from aerial
photographic study.
• Mention the earthquake status with respect to seismic zone of the project area.
• Mention the probable environmental impact due to the project construction. Also, mention
whether the construction of a reservoir project may lead to loss of any archaeological
treasure or will endanger the wildlife in that area.
• In conclusion and recommendation part at the end of the report, express opinion on
general feasibility of the project and suitability of the proposed site from geotechnical
consideration. In case of alternative sites, recommend the one with the best geological
condition. Recommendation may also be given if a better location is sited from fi eld
observation than the one or those proposed by the engineers. The programme of further
geological work necessary including exploratory work and laboratory tests of soil or rock
for a project site is also outlined in the recommendation.
23.5.2 Design Phase Report
The following aspects need to be included in the report submitted in the design phase:
• Provide detailed project features and include a map showing the single or different sites or
alignments depending upon the nature of the project.
• Report the general topographical features of the project area and detailed morphology of
the site observed from aerial photographic interpretation, followed by ground checking
Chapter_23.indd 506 10/18/2012 5:30:02 PM
Guidelines for Writing an Engineering Geology Report ● 507
in and around the structural sites. Describe the main features to be observed at the site
including rock, soil, and overburden conditions; morphology, landslope, erosional feature,
and drainage pattern; and stability status of the site.
• Describe site geology in detail as revealed from investigation of the site by large-scale
geological mapping. Include geological map of the site showing rock types with attitudes
and structural details.
• Describe the subsurface geology including foundation grade and thickness of overburden
from results of exploratory work. Enclose a geological cross section showing the bedrock
and fresh rock levels.
• State groundwater condition and its infl uence in the project area. This is especially
important while submitting report on the investigation of tunnel alignment or sites for
subsurface structures.
• Mention the earthquakes that have affected the project area under investigation consulting
old earthquake records and seismic zonation map of India. The information helps the
design engineer to decide about the seismic factor to be incorporated in the design of the
project structure.
• Discuss the problems that may arise due to adverse geological structures such as a fault or
shear zone in the foundation and suggest the remedy.
• Provide information regarding quality and quantity of construction materials available in
and around the project area for the construction of the proposed structure corroborating
laboratory and fi eld test data for their engineering properties.
• Give details of expansive soil, if present, including the area of its occurrence and its
possible adverse role on stability and the relevant remediation measures.
• For design purposes, mention the depth to sound rock suitable for founding the structure
and provide engineering properties such as strength, compressibility, and permeability
of the foundation rocks in a tabular form together with in-situ stress and groundwater
condition when available.
• Provide a summarized account of the laboratory or fi eld test results on rock and soil in the
body of the report in a tabular form and the details as appendix of the report. Submit the
logs of drill holes in proper log charts.
• Depending upon the type of the project, provide the foundation condition in conclusion
and recommendation in clear terms, including the defects of the rock or soil in any part of
the structural site and the method of treatment for their remedy.
23.5.3 Construction Phase Report
The following are the points to be noted when submitting an engineering geological report in
the construction phase:
• A resident engineering geologist in the construction stage provides short reports or notes
based on the site inspection. The geologist meets the engineers to discuss geotechnical
problems observed after excavation of the site and suggests remedy whenever required.
The observations, suggestions, and discussions are refl ected in these reports.
• In-fi eld reports or notes are written by the resident geologist on the geological features that
require immediate attention of the engineers for construction purposes involving treatment
of weak zones. Such notes sometimes require approval of the supervising offi cer and may
be routed through headquarters to the engineers in a short time.
Chapter_23.indd 507 10/18/2012 5:30:02 PM
508 ● Engineering Geology
• Some geological ‘surprises’ may appear in the foundation after excavation at the
construction stage. The resident geologist studies the geological features related to such
surprises and submits a report explaining the signifi cance of these earlier unknown
geological features and the associated construction problems, if any. The engineering
design is generally kept fl exible to cater to the need of such changed circumstances due to
unknown geology.
• A detailed report of construction stage work is submitted to headquarters covering
all geotechnical works carried out from the site excavation until the completion of
construction. The details of geological defects observed and suggestions given on their
corrective measures are the most important aspects to be included in the construction
stage report. This report will also include large-scale geological maps of foundation and
documents of other survey works to serve as valuable guide for taking measures on any
post-construction foundation problem.
23.6 REPORT FOR SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS
The services of engineering geologists are also utilized for short-time work related to specifi c
geological investigation such as search for railway ballasts or to ascertain the stability of a
habitation site or a hill slope traversed by a road or rail line, subsoil condition of airport, and
foundation of bridge piers. In all these cases, engineering geologists are involved in fi eld
investigations including exploratory works to fi nd subsurface soil or rock condition. The report
of such investigations contains the morphology, details of rock or soil of the site, and especially
adverse geological conditions, if any, and the remedial measures of geological weaknesses.
This report, like any engineering geology report, fi rst states the features investigated and the
problems inferred and then recommends, whenever necessary, for further geotechnical work at
the site by exploration to reveal the subsurface condition of rock or soil. When the exploration
is completed, the engineering geologist revisits the site and submits a detailed report describing
the substrata condition and outlining the remedial measures in case of adverse geological
condition of the site. The report also contains geological map and records of subsurface
exploratory works.
23.7 IN-FIELD PREPARATION OF WRITE-UP FOR A REPORT
The following suggestions help in the preparation of a comprehensive report with maximum
inputs of fi eld observations:
At the end of a day’s fi eldwork or after investigation for a couple of days, the geologist
should prepare a detailed write-up on the observation in the fi eld itself when it will be possible
to remember every single detail of the fi eld observation. As the work progresses, this daily
or time-to-time prepared write-up can be further updated, so that it fi nally takes the shape of
a draft report. If fi eld testing is done on rock or soil, the geologist can write up the methods
followed, the result obtained, and any other related matter in the same form to be submitted to
the headquarters.
In the fi eld, the geologist can also prepare a fresh copy of geological map, geological section,
drill hole log sheets, and other data chart or tables, as may be required to be submitted with the
report as supporting evidence. In this way, it is possible to document all the fi eld observations
in the form of a draft report. If these details are not updated as and when the observations are
made, and the geologist waits until returning to the headquarters to write the report, minute
Chapter_23.indd 508 10/18/2012 5:30:02 PM
Guidelines for Writing an Engineering Geology Report ● 509
details and even some vital observations on geological problems may be forgotten or left out. In
the headquarters, the fi nal report can be submitted after adding laboratory test results on rock or
soil and making the necessary minor modifi cations after consulting other professional reports
or relevant literature on earlier work in the area.
23.8 ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE OF AN ENGINEERING GEOLOGY REPORT
Selected portions of a report titled Reconnaissance Investigation of Three Alternative
Alignments for a Diversion Tunnel in Eastern Nepal (1965–1968) written by the renowned
engineering geologist Dr J.B. Auden are provided in this section as an illustrative example
of an engineering geology report. The full text of the report (20 pages) may be read from the
publication (Auden 1971).
It may be noted from Dr Auden’s report that the title of the report itself gives a clear idea
regarding the type and location of the engineering project and that it is a preliminary stage
report. This report is illustrated by seven geological maps with cross sections of subsurface
strata and four tables bearing quantitative data. The report starts with an abstract followed
by introduction and then description of the relevant matters under the following eight
headings:
1. Introduction
2. Question of feasibility
3. Topographical survey
4. Geological environment and structure
5. The three alignments
6. Geological conditions and seismicity
7. Formations along the alternative alignments
8. Conclusion
Abstract
Studies were made by the author about the feasibility of a project for utilizing the waters of
the river Sun Kosi in Eastern Nepal for the combined purposes of irrigation of the Terai region
and generation of hydroelectric power. The project would require the construction of diversion
barrage, pick-up weir, tunnel, and powerhouse in the Sun Kosi basin. The complex geological
and tectonic set-up of the area has been discussed through which three alternative tunnel
alignments varying in length from 6,220 m to 14,000 m are proposed within a distance of 85 km
along the river.
To satisfy the topographic and engineering requirements, the alternative tunnel alignments
are to traverse some of the formations such as Nathens, Daling, and Darjeeling gneiss. Out of the
three alternatives, two alignments are to intersect the main boundary fault, Daling megathrust,
and a few fault planes. All the three alignments fall within the high-intensity seismic belt close
to the Gangetic downwarp in front of the Himalayan chain.
A classifi cation of the rock group liable to major or minor overbreaks within the tunnel
section has been enumerated on the basis of the physical conditions and inherent strength of the
different rock groups to be encountered within the alignments.
Besides the geological considerations, the report deals with other aspects requiring
dovetailing of the tunnel diversion project with other developmental river valley projects along
the main path of the river Kosi.

510 ● Engineering Geology
Introduction
While a member of the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), Rome, the author made a
brief reconnaissance investigation in 1965, 1966, and 1968 of the alternative alignments for
a diversion tunnel between the river Sun Kosi and the terrain south of the Mahabharat Lekh.
The project involved the diversion of water from the river for irrigation in the Terai plains and
the generation of hydroelectric power. The work was part of the feasibility study undertaken
by FAO fi rst with its own staff and subsequently under contract with the fi rm of consulting
engineer Nippon Koei of Tokyo.
In all, three alignments were studied, now termed ‘A’, ‘B’, and ‘C’, while a fourth alignment
‘D’ was also later considered by Messrs Nippon Koei. The ESE–WNW distance between
the alternatives A and C is 85 km from coordinates 26°50′:86°49′ to 27°14′:86°05′. It was
assumed for purpose of initial reconnaissance that the internal diameter of the diversion
tunnel would be 7.8 m, with a gradient of 2.18 m/km, and that the pressure tunnel would
deliver 140 m3/s.
The project would require the construction of a diversion barrage on the Sun Kosi, a tunnel
under the Mahabharat Lekh, a power station at the tunnel outlet, a pick-up weir on either rivers
Kamala or Trijuga, and a system of canals in the Terai.

Conclusion
Only a few of the problems concerning the alternative alignments for a tunnel diversion project
have been discussed in this report. There is no doubt that from the point of view of geological
conditions, the least complex alignment would be that between Khampu Ghat and Deoghar
(alignment A). This tunnel would be driven entirely within the lower Siwaliks and would avoid
the two major regional overthrusts, which would be present in B and C alignments. The tunnel
would be half the length of B and C tunnels and the available water from the catchment of
17,600 km2 would be much more than that further upstream.
The geological and hydrological characteristics of each tunnel alignment are not, however,
the only factor that needs to be considered. This assignment of water potential, making full
use of the local topography with subsidiary structure and tunnels, power production, different
irrigable areas, and case of canal distribution, is complex. It is understood that the different
factors have been the subject of computer analysis in Tokyo since 1968. There is further problem
of dovetailing the tunnel diversion project with the possible construction of a high dam on the
Sapta Kosi and a reservoir that would extend far up the Sun Kosi tributary. Finally, it may well
be that the most economical project for the irrigation of the Terai will be by utilization of the
groundwater, without recourse to tunnel diversion. Whatever the ultimate outcome, the work
undertaken along Sun Kosi and Mahabharat Lekh will be of some value from a geological and
engineering perspective.

Physiography, Stratigraphy, and
Ores and Minerals of India
LEARNING OBJECT IVES
After studying this chapter, the reader will be familiar with the following:
• Physiographic features of India • Important ores and their occurrence
• Rock formations of India and their • Precious and semiprecious stones of
occurrence India
24.1 INTRODUCTION
The physiographic features of India are related with the varied geology of the
country. The three distinct physiographic forms include the peninsular region of the
south, the Himalayan terrain of the north, and the Indo-Gangetic plains in the central
part washed by the rivers Indus and Ganges and their tributaries. India has a diverse
geological set-up starting from the oldest rock formations to the younger alluvium.
Different regions of the country are constituted of rock types of different geological
periods such as the Precambrian gneiss, schist, and granites in the peninsula and
eastern India, sedimentary metamorphic rocks of the Dharwar and the Cuddapah
of the South, the Vindhyan formation of central India with good quality building
stones, the Gondwana formation of Damodar valley with best coal seams, and the
Deccan trap area of the Peninsula with vast sheet of lava fl ow hardened to basalt.
Gold, iron, copper, aluminium, chromium, and other ores and many minerals of
economic importance including uranium also occur in the rocks of the country. All
these aspects form the subject matter of discussion in this chapter.
24.2 PHYSIOGRAPHIC FEATURES OF INDIA
The physiographic form of the Indian subcontinent today is the result of the vast
geological formations of this land mass being a part of the primordial crust of the
earth. India can be divided into three distinct physiographic divisions:
(i) The peninsular plateau
(ii) The extra-peninsular region comprising the Himalayas
(iii) The Indo-Gangetic plains
Chapter_24.indd 513 10/18/2012 5:31:02 PM
514 ● Engineering Geology
It can also be stated that the Indian peninsula with its oldest rock formations was a part of the
ancient Gondwanaland, which drifted northwards and striking with the Central Asiatic plates
rose up to form the Himalayas out of Tethys Sea. The Indus and the Ganges originated from the
Himalayas and with their tributaries deposited piles of sediments through geological times to
form the vast tract of alluvial plains.
24.2.1 The Peninsular Plateau
The peninsular plateau occupies the southern part of India fronting on two great arms of
the Indian Ocean—the Arabian Sea on the west and the Bay of Bengal on the east. The
peninsula is also called peninsula shield as it is the most stable land mass of the earth’s crust
composed of ancient rocks. The land mass is
roughly triangular in shape and consists of a vast
tableland broken by the river valleys. The land
slopes gently downwards towards the east.
The peninsular area is washed by the rivers
Narmada, Tapti, Godavari, Krishna, and Cauvery,
the old rivers of India. The Aravalli range, which
is the eroded land mass of a very old mountain
range of the geological past, covers the north-
western part of the peninsula. The Vindhyan
range (Fig. 24.1) and the Satpura range are the
other mountain systems occupying the north and
central parts of this ancient land mass.
The east and west coasts of India that border
the eastern and western parts of the peninsula are
of uniform and regular nature. A large portion
of the coasts is sandy and the gently shelving
coastal strip is washed by shallow sea. There are
raised beaches with lands extending over areas
of both the coasts. The beaches lie above the
Fig. 24.1 The Vindhyan hill in Madhya Pradesh
level of highest denudation by the tides. There is
comprising horizontally-to-sub-horizontally bedded red
sandstone evidence that the western coast is slightly higher
in level than the eastern coast.
There is a scanty margin of alluvial deposit on the western coast except in Gujarat, whereas
there is a wide belt of riverborne alluvium on the east coast in addition to the great deltaic
deposits of the rivers Mahanadi, Godavari, Krishna, and Cauvery. Such deltaic deposit is not
found in the rivers fl owing in the west, namely the river Narmada and the river Tapti. The other
signifi cant feature is that whereas all other rivers fl ow to the east, these two rivers fl ow towards
the west—a feature explained by the fact that these two rivers do not fl ow in channels formed
of their own erosion, but run along fault-controlled tectonic valleys.
24.2.2 The Extra-peninsular Area
The extra-peninsular region occupies the northern parts of India, extending over nearly
2000 km from Arunachal Pradesh in the east to Jammu and Kashmir in the west and being
governed by the Himalayas (Fig. 24.2). The Himalayas is classifi ed into three parallel or
longitudinal zones, each having distinct well-marked orographic features. The following are
these zones:
Chapter_24.indd 514 10/18/2012 5:31:02 PM
Physiography, Stratigraphy, and Ores and Minerals of India ● 515
(i) The Great Himalayas is the innermost line of high ranges, rising above the limit of the
peripheral snow. The average height extends to 6500 m. High peaks such as Mount
Everest, K2, Kanchenjunga, and Nanga Parbat are situated here.
(ii) The Lesser Himalayas or the middle ranges is a series of ranges that is closely related to
the Greater Himalayas but is of lower elevation; they do not rise above 4000–5000 m. The
Lesser Himalayas forms an intricate system of ranges whose average width is about 80 km.

plains. It is formed of a group of low hills that are about 1000–1300 m high.

Fig. 24.2 Simplifi ed geological map of India showing major geological
formations and three physiographic divisions
Geologically, the northern or Tibetan zone, lying beyond the line of highest elevation, is
composed of a continuous series of fossiliferous marine sedimentary rocks, ranging in age
from the Palaeozoic to the Eocene age. The Central or Himalayan zone, comprising the Lesser
or Middle Himalayas, is composed of crystalline or metamorphic rocks such as granite and
gneisses with unfossiliferous sedimentary deposits of ancient age. The Outer or Sub-Himalayan
zone corresponding to the Siwalik ranges is composed of Tertiary, especially upper Tertiary,
sedimentary river deposits.
Several high ridges intersected with deep valleys are the characteristic features of the
Himalayan mountainous region. The three most famous rivers of India, namely the Indus, the
Chapter_24.indd 515 10/18/2012 5:31:03 PM
516 ● Engineering Geology
Ganges, and the Brahmaputra, originate from the snow-clad peaks of the Himalayas. The Great
Himalayas and the Trans-Himalayas in the further northern parts are composed of metamorphic
rocks such as quartzite and phyllite, at places with intrusive granite. The extra-peninsular region
has undergone several tectonic events causing extensive folding, faulting, and thrusting of rock
formations of this Himalayan terrain.
The prominent features of the extra-peninsula, the mountain border of India formed by the
upheaval of the crust during the late Tertiary time, are the internal structures made up of series
of broad anticlines and synclines. The anticlines are faulted in their southern limbs lying in
juxtaposition with their younger limbs. The outer ranges are separated by narrow longitudinal
valleys or depressions. The reverse faults are the most common characteristic feature in the tectonics
of the sub-Himalayan ranges. Overfolds, inversions, and thrust planes assume an increasing degree
of intensity. The most prominent is the Main Boundary Fault (MBF) at the southern boundary of
the extra-peninsula. Several of the mountain ranges of the Himalayas are separated by deep defi les
and valleys, having a number of watersheds, peaks, and passes and other rugged features.
The northern fl ank of the Himalayas hinges with the gigantic Tibetan plateau. The south-east
extension of the Himalayas is characterized by the Assam ranges, which have somewhat unique
physiographic expressions. The extremely rugged and lofty central ranges of the Himalayas are
constantly capped by snow and ice. This is in contrast with the mountains of the Lesser Himalayas
where the land mass is occupied by the Siwalik ranges. The conspicuous features of this part are
the series of escarpments, deep slopes and broad valleys, which result in a peneplain landform.
24.2.3 The Indo-Gangetic Plains
The third physiographic division, namely the Indo-Gangetic plains, encompasses the extensive
area from Assam in the east to Punjab in the west. The region is named after the rivers Indus and
Ganges, the twin river systems that drain it. Geophysical test by GSI has estimated a sediment
deposit of thickness 100 m to 5000 m in the Gangetic alluvium. The Gangetic plains owe their
origin to a crustal depression that was later fi lled by sediments created by the erosion of the
Himalayan terrain and carried by the rivers through geological time. The persistent fl atness is
entirely due to the aggrading works of the rivers of the Indus–Ganga system.
The Indus, which fl ows with a large amount of water at the western part, has fi ve main
tributaries, namely Sutlej, Beas, Ravi, Chenab, and Jhelum. The Ganges in its downstream
course from the Himalayas is fed by tributaries such as the Alakananda, Bhagirathi, Mandakini,
Jhanhabi, and Yamuna. ‘These alluvial plains of the Ganges are of absorbing interest in human
history, being thickly populated, and the scene of many important developments and events in
the cultural and social history of India’, observed Krishnan (1949).
The Indo-Gangetic plains, also known as the ‘Great Plains’, run parallel to the Himalayan
mountains from Jammu and Kashmir in the west to Assam in the east, draining most parts of
northern and eastern India. The plains encompass an area of 700,000 km2. The area is divided
into two distinct drainage basins by the Delhi Ridge. The eastern part consists of the Ganga–
Brahmaputra drainage systems and the western part consists of the Punjab plain and the Haryana
plain. This divide is only 300 m above the sea level. The Ganges in its lower part fl ows into the
ocean and forms the Gangetic delta.
The large area covered by the Indo-Gangetic plains is classifi ed into the following four divisions:
(i) The Bhabar belt is at the foothills of the Himalayas. It consists mainly of boulders and
pebbles and is generally narrow, about 7–15 km in width. Here, the streams f low below
the porous detritus.
Chapter_24.indd 516 10/18/2012 5:31:03 PM
Physiography, Stratigraphy, and Ores and Minerals of India ● 517
(ii) The Terai belt lies next to the Bhabar region and consists of newer alluvium. The rivers
fl owing subsurface in the Bhabar region reappear in this zone, which receives heavy
rainfall throughout the year. The area is thickly forested and populated by wildlife.
(iii) The Bhangar belt consists of older alluvium and forms the alluvial terraces of the fl ood
plains. In parts of the Gangetic plains, the low upland areas are covered by laterites.
(iv) The Khadar belt lies in the lowlands, covering areas of West Bengal. It is made up of
freshly deposited newer alluvium, which are piles of sediment carried by the rivers fl owing
down the plain.
The Indo-Gangetic plain is considered to be the world’s most extensive expanse of
uninterrupted alluvium, formed by the deposition of the numerous rivers. The plains are
conducive for irrigation through canals, and the areas are extensively irrigated mainly for crops
such as rice and wheat as well as maize and sugarcane. Indo-Gangetic plains are one of the
world’s most densely populated areas.
24.3 STRATIGRAPHY OF INDIA

24.4 THE ARCHAEAN COMPLEX
‘The Archaean complex possesses the oldest rocks of the crust forming the core of the mountain
chains of the world. They are thoroughly crystalline, extremely contorted and faulted and
intruded by plutonic rocks and generally have deformed and foliated structures and as such
named fundamental complex or the basement complex’, observed Wadia (1966).
24.4.1 Gneisses and Granites
The Archaean complex of India belongs to Precambrian fundamental basement complex
intruded by several plutonic rocks such as the Bengal gneisses (Fig. 24.3), charnockites, and
Bundelkhand gneisses. The highly schistose sediments, the para-gneisses and schists such as
Dharwars and Aravallis, are younger than the gneisses.
Bengal gneisses These rocks belong to the oldest
member of the Archaean complex. They are highly
foliated and are, at places, schistose in nature.
They are found in West Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, and
Karnataka. The rocks are also found to contain
bands of limestone, dolomite, hornblende schist,
and corundum rocks. The rocks have formed a
dome-shaped structure in the northern part of West
Bengal and are called dome gneisses.
Bundelkhand gneiss This gneiss is sparsely
foliated and occurs as pink granite. Hornblende and
Fig. 24.3 Gneissic rock of Archaean complex with
chlorite schist are associated with the gneiss. The
contorted structure (Wadia 1966)
rocks are traversed by dykes and sills and at places
by pegmatite. The gneissic rocks are also found in
parts of the Peninsula and are known as Balaghat
gneiss, Hosur gneiss, and so on. They were used
in building many temples of south India.
Charnockites series Charnockites occur in
the peninsular region, especially in Tamil Nadu
(Fig. 24.4) and Nilgiri hills. The rocks have a
distinct petrological province that is different
from any other occurrences of the gneissic rocks.
It was fi rst observed in the hills in Tamil Nadu and
was named by Sir T.H. Holland, the then Head of
Fig. 24.4 A barren hill top of charnockite with a
spheroidally weathered rock mass in Tamil Nadu GSI, as charnockite after Job Charnock, whose
tomb in Kolkata is made of this rock. Petrological
composition of charnockite includes hypersthene, blue quartz, plagioclase, hornblende, and
biotite and accessory minerals such as zircon, iron oxide, and graphite. The rocks are formed by
magmatic differentiation and segregation and show fi ne-grained basic veins.
24.4.2 Precambrian Sedimentaries
There are several sedimentary sequences (series) in India which show few or no metamorphism.
Among them the most ancient is the Bijawar and Gwalior series, older than 1800 million years,
Chapter_24.indd 518 10/18/2012 5:31:03 PM
Physiography, Stratigraphy, and Ores and Minerals of India ● 519
and the Cuddapah series which is around 1700 million years old. The sedimentation in the
Vindhyan series ranges from 1400 to 500 million years. The following subsections give details
of each of these series.
Dharwar system
The Dharwar rocks are of sedimentary origin but are unfossiliferous and exist occupying a
synclinal basin. Metamorphism of the rocks has infl uenced obliteration of the original forms,
and presently the rocks possess crystalline and schistose characteristics and are intruded by
granite bosses, veins, and sheets and by dolerite dykes. The rocks have diverse characteristics—
clastic sediments, volcanic, and plutonic rocks metamorphosed to different extents. They
contain iron ores associated with hematite and magnetite schists. The Dharwars also contain
volcanic rocks such as rhyolite and andesite as well as crystalline limestone.
Dharwar system is of great economic importance as it contains many metallic ores such as
gold, manganese, iron, copper, and even tungsten and lead. The manganese of Dharwars occurs
in Gondites of Balaghat and Nagpur and also Kodurites of Orissa and Andhra Pradesh.
Aravalli series
Dharwarian rocks are exposed in a large area
covering the Aravalli range of Rajasthan. The
Aravalli range is the most ancient mountain
range of India and came into existence during
the Dharwar era, when the sediments that
were deposited in the seas were lifted up
forming mountains. The metamorphism of
the sedimentaries of the Aravallis gave rise to
folded, extremely contorted, and foliated rocks
(Fig. 24.5). The Aravallis are composed of
quartzite (Fig. 24.6), mica schist, hornblende
schist, and other feldspathic schists and gneisses.
The Shillong series of Assam developed at the
Fig. 24.5 Contorted and folded Aravalli same time as the Aravallis. These rocks consist of
sedimentaries of Rajasthan
thick deposits of quartzite, arenaceous phyllite,
slates, and schists with the intrusion of granite
and basic interbedded traps.
Cuddapah system
The unfossiliferous sedimentary rocks of the
Cuddapah system were formed in Proterozoic
period after the Dharwar time when there
were earth movements creating wrinkles in the
Aravallis. The Cuddapah system is composed
of compacted shales, slates, quartzite, and
limestone with secondary minerals such as
mica, staurolite, andalusite, and garnet. Volcanic
eruption took place during the lower half of the
system with the lava fl ow forming traps and tuff

divisions, an upper and a lower. They contain several well-defi ned series that may be homotaxial
as shown in Table 24.2.

Vindhyan system
The Vindhyan system (Fig. 24.1) of the Proterozoic period is a vast stratifi ed formation
consisting of sandstone, shale, and limestone of 4000 m thickness. These stratifi ed rocks show
unique uniform characteristics, having horizontal beds and red to buff colour (Fig. 24.1). The
Lower Vindhyan rocks, however, experienced igneous intrusion containing granite and rhyolite.
The Vindhyan rocks are classifi ed under two divisions. The entire rock succession of the two
divisions is formed with an unconformity as shown in Table 24.3.

Extensive occurrences of the Vindhyan rocks in high hills are found in Madhya Pradesh and
also in Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan. Throughout their thickness, the Vindhyan
rocks show shallow water deposits with ripple marks and sun cracks However, the vast piles
of sediments show no evidence of presence of any fossil. Vindhyan sandstones are excellent
building stones and have been used in the construction of royal palaces and various monuments
of India from ancient times.
24.5 PALAEOZOIC ERA
The Palaeozoic Era constitutes rocks from Cambrian to Permian ages. These rocks occur in a
number of areas covering the Salt Range, Spiti and Kashmir areas of the Himalayas, the coastal
areas of the South, and parts of Assam. The rocks of these places are described in this section
with respect to the geological periods starting from the Cambrian age.
Chapter_24.indd 520 10/18/2012 5:31:04 PM
Physiography, Stratigraphy, and Ores and Minerals of India ● 521
24.5.1 Cambrian System
Marine fossiliferous rocks of the Cambrian period were developed in Kashmir and Spiti areas
of the Himalayas in Kumaon, north of Shimla, and in the Salt Range, northwest of Punjab.
These rocks contain well-preserved fossils that help in fi xing the age of rock formations. The
lowermost Cambrian bed occurs in the Salt Range as Salt marl, overlying which is a shallow
water deposit containing fossils of brachiopod Neobolus and other fossils, namely Schizopolis,
Lingula, Orthis, Redlichia (a trilobite), and Nyolithes (mollusc). The brachiopod and trilobite
resemble the Cambrian of Europe, which stamps the rocks as of Cambrian age. Fossiliferous
sedimentary rocks of Lower Cambrian time are found in the Salt Range of Punjab and in the
Spiti areas of Central Himalayas. The succession of fossiliferous Lower Cambrian Salt Range
rocks is shown in Table 24.4.

24.5.2 Silurian and Devonian
The best development of Silurian and Devonian rocks is found in the Spiti area of the Himalayas
where the rocks overlie the Haimanta and underlie the red quartzite and grits (Muth quartzite)
of Devonian period as shown in Table 24.5.
Table 24.5 Types of Silurian and Devonian rocks

shaley limestone with brachiopod and gastropod
Lower Silurian Shales and fl aggy sandstone, dolomite, and limestone

The rocks of the Silurian period include limestone, fl aggy shale, quartzite, sandstone, and
conglomerate possessing characteristic Silurian fauna. Such Silurian rocks also occur in Kashmir.
Overlying the siliceous and coral limestone of the Silurian, there is the typical Ordovician of
white-coloured Muth quartzite, which is of considerable thickness (nearly 100 m).
In Chitral area of Kashmir, stratifi ed sequence also developed resembling the Devonian
rocks of Spiti. In addition, the Hazara area of Kashmir contains conglomerate followed by red
sandstone and shale overlain by limestone which are 600 m thickness. The rocks of Chitral area
of Kashmir are from Devonian period followed by upper Silurian of Spiti.
Chapter_24.indd 521 10/18/2012 5:31:04 PM
522 ● Engineering Geology
24.5.3 Carboniferous and Permian
The Permo-Carboniferous rocks occur in the Salt Range, which is a thick and highly fossiliferous
stratum. The rocks are divided into two groups. The lower group is speckled sandstone
containing glaciated boulders and mottled sandstone with fossils of upper Carboniferous age.
Following these strata, there is the Productus limestone (150 m thick) of Permian age. It consists
of calcareous sandstone followed by arenaceous limestone, cherty limestone, and sandstone with
typical Permian fossils and the basement bed of Permo-Carboniferous boulder conglomerate.
In the Central Himalayas of Chitral province, trilobite and brachiopod fossils are found
in calcareous sandstone of Lipak series (lower Carboniferous) and the Po series (upper
Carboniferous) having Fenestella shales interbedded between them. The Lipak series is
equivalent to the Syringothyris limestone of Kashmir. In some places, an agglomerate bed of
volcanic origin overlies the Carboniferous rocks. The Permo-Triassic rocks possess the typical
fossiliferous bed Productus limestone of marine origin.
24.6 GONDWANA FORMATION
Gondwana rock formation is the most important in Indian stratigraphy as good variety coal
seams are available in this formation. The deposition of the Gondwana sedimentaries started
from the Permo-Carboniferous time and continued until the Jurassic time. This formation is
divided into three groups as shown in Table 24.6.
Table 24.6 Classifi cation of Gondwana formation

Ranigunj stage
Damuda series Ironstone stage (ironstone shale)
Lower Gondwana
Barakar stage (coal bearing)
(Permo-Carboniferous)
Karharbari stage
Talchir series
Talchir stage (boulder bed)
The coal-bearing rocks of the Gondwana system are found mainly in the Damodar valley
and also in parts of the Mahanadi and Godavari valleys. The best occurrence of coal is in the
Damodar valley covering the Ranigunj, Asansol, and Jharia areas of West Bengal and also in
parts of Bihar. The Gondwana rocks also contain marks of climatic change from arctic cold
to tropical and desert conditions. Among the Talchir rocks, the Talchir tillite shows evidence
of some glacial deposition. Figure 24.7 shows a geological section of Gondwana system rock
formation of Satpura with faulted contact of basement Archaean with lowermost Talchir series
followed by Damuda, Pachmarhi, Kamthi, and Jabalpur with a faulted contact of Deccan trap
(Wadia 1966; original drawing by Meddlicot of GSI (1872)).

Fig. 24.7 Generalized section through the Gondwana basin of the Satpura region
(Wadia 1966)
The Gondwana rocks occur extending over a wide area from the Ranigunj hill to Nagpur.
The rock formations are also found in other places such as Satpura hills (Fig. 24.7), Godavari
valley, Jabalpur, and the east coast. The component rocks are mainly well-bedded shale and
sandstones. The lower Gondwana rocks are about 300 m thick, whereas the thickness of
middle Gondwana is over 1000 m. The Gondwana sedimentaries contain a number of plant
fossils such as Gangamopteris, Glossopteris, and Vertebraria with some insects and worm
tracts in the lower stages. The majority of the plant fossils are found in the middle Gondwana
rocks and vertebrate fossils including reptiles in the upper Gondwana rocks (Panchet stage).
The Damuda coal-bearing strata at places are traversed by igneous intrusion such as dykes,
destroying the coals.
24.7 MESOZOIC ERA
As described in Section 24.6, the deposits of Gondwana sedimentaries continued covering
Triassic and Jurassic times. The Mesozoic rocks representing Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous
periods have been developed in different parts of India such as the Himalayas, Kashmir, the
south coast, and Assam.
24.7.1 Triassic Period
The Triassic formation is well developed in the northern parts of the Himalayas and the adjoining
Garwal and Kumaon. The component members of the system are mainly limestone and dolomite
with intercalations of blue colour shale. The rocks are richly fossiliferous containing Triassic
marine fossil of the genera Trilobites, Ceratites, Flemingites, and Spirifer.
In Kashmir, the development of Trias is also very large. A thick bed of compact blue
limestone and dolomite is displayed in many places. In addition, the Triassic rocks occur with
an unconformity over the Devonian rock, the basal parts having a 30 m-thick fossiliferous
limestone bed of Triassic fossil.
In the Salt Range area, Trias is developed in the western part over the Productus limestone
with ammonite fossils of Ceratites of Lower Trias in fl aggy limestone. The Trias of Salt Range
are named Ceratites bed on account of the abundance of the fossil ammonite ceratite. This bed
consists of calcareous sandstone and arenaceous limestone.
24.7.2 Jurassic Period
The Jurassic strata of the Himalayas has two distinct rock units, namely Kiato limestone of 610 m
to 915 m thickness of Lower Jurassic and the Spiti black shale of Upper Jurassic overlying it
and extending over almost the entire distance of the Himalayas. The Spiti shale contains several
Chapter_24.indd 523 10/18/2012 5:31:04 PM
524 ● Engineering Geology
fossil ammonites such as Phylloceras, Litoceras, and Hoploceros and also a large number of
lamellibranch such as Belemnites, Pecten, and Corbula, which are typical indicators of the
Jurassic age. The Hazara area has also developed Jurassic formation with fossils of the Spiti
area types. Moreover, the Jurassic beds are developed in the Salt Range area containing Jurassic-
type fossil Ceratites. Marine transgression during the Jurassic period took place in coastal India
and in parts of Kutch and Tiruchirappalli and in the low-lying fl at areas of Rajasthan.
24.7.3 Cretaceous Period
The Cretaceous system of India is marked by extensive occurrences in South India where the
Niniyur, the Ariyalur, the Tiruchirappalli, and the Utatur stages of sedimentary rock formations
occur in succession as lower to upper beds. The Utatur stage is very famous for its phosphatic
nodules, which are an important source of
phosphate in the country. In the central provinces,
there is the well-developed Lameta bed, which
contains fossils that helped to ascertain the late
Cretaceous or Palaeocene age of the Deccan traps.
Towards the end of the cretaceous period,
there was a great geological event in India when
a volcanic eruption caused lava fl ow extending
over an area of 500,000 km2, which formed the
basaltic rocks of the Deccan trap (Fig. 24.8).
The volcanic activity continued until the Tertiary
Fig. 24.8 Deccan trap basalt (also called trap rock)
period and even the Eocene time. The basalts
formed of volcanic lava fl ow
of Deccan trap are used in various engineering
constructions such as railway ballasts and building stones, and the famous black soil well suited
for cotton growth is derived from this rock.
24.8 TERTIARY ROCK FORMATIONS
The Tertiary period is the most important in Indian stratigraphy and tectonic history. The volcanic
activity of the Deccan is associated with two great events: the break-up of the Gondwana land
mass and the Himalayan orogeny related to the uplift out of Tethys Sea began at this period and
the volcanism of the Deccan traps continued. The basaltic rocks of the Deccan traps (Upper
Cretaceous to Eocene) are found over an extensive area of Maharashtra and other parts of the
Deccan (see Fig. 24.2).
The rocks of the Tertiary system are found mostly in the Himalayas. In the peninsula, they
occur in the coastal areas of Gujarat, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu. In the Shimla area, the Tertiary
sedimentaries are divided into three series: the Subathu series consisting of grey and red shales
followed upwards by the Dagshai series comprising red claystone and the Kasauli series
composed of sandstone. Table 24.7 gives the Tertiary succession of Kashmir Himalayas along
with the thickness of rock formations and the rock types:

In the east in Assam, nummulitic limestone occurs in Khasi hills. Oil is associated with these
rocks of Oligocene–Miocene age. In the Salt Range area, nummulitic limestone representing
Eocene is extensively developed. The Middle Tertiary is absent but Upper Siwalik rocks of
Pliocene age are present as shown in Table 24.8.

Along the foothills of the Himalayas, Siwalik molasse consisting of conglomerate, sandstones,
and shales with a height of nearly 6100 m are traceable for a long distance (Fig. 24.9). The
Siwalik system ranges in age from the Middle to the Late Tertiary period. The Siwalik is famous
for vertebrate fauna apart from echinoids, gastropods, foraminifera, and corals. Though the
strength of the rocks is not high, a number of large dams including the 225 m-high concrete
Bhakra of Punjab, one of the largest dams in the world, were successfully constructed in the
Siwalik rocks due to ingenious engineering design.

24.9 QUATERNARY PERIOD
The Quaternary period is marked by glacial condition in parts of the Himalayas showing
indication of Ice age as in Europe. The enormous large terminal moraines and scattered
blocks of smooth hummocky hills of low elevation with striated marks bear testimony of
an Ice age in Pleistocene. Equally, the irregularities in the drainage fl ows bear evidence of
such glaciated condition with ice movement. The Quaternary Ice age deposits are found in
Kashmir.
The Indo-Gangetic plains comprising the thick piles of sediments covering the vast area from
Punjab to Assam belong to the Quaternary period. The plains were formed mainly by the aggrading
Chapter_24.indd 525 10/18/2012 5:31:05 PM

action of Himalayas through its rivers and monsoon rains. The alluvial deposits consist of clay,
silt, loam, and so on. The alluvium is divided into the following groups as shown in Table 24.9.
Table 24.9 Deltaic deposits of the Indus and the Ganges of recent time
Newer alluvium Khadar of Punjab
Older alluvium Bhangar of the Ganga
Unconformity
Rocks of unknown ages of Archaean and Gondwana
The older alluvium or Bhangar occurs on the ground above the fl ood level whereas the
Khadar is confi ned to the river channel and their fl ood plains. The Bhangar confi ned to West
Bengal and Uttar Pradesh is composed completely of Pleistocene deposit, whereas Khadar
gradually passes to recent time, occupying the higher level. The Khadar contains comparatively
less kankars (coarse sediments). The deltas of the Ganges and the Brahmaputra have khadar
deposits. Similarly, the delta deposit of the Indus contains sediments covering up to recent time.
The alluvial plains bear the most fertile soils of the country, with new deposition of silt every
year by the rivers during monsoon time.
The Indo-Gangetic alluvium is a great source of freshwater. At all places of the alluvium
deposit, groundwater is available at a shallow depth by dug wells or tube wells. The term
Bhabar denotes gravel talus and steep slopes. Terai is the densely forested marshy ground at a
lower level of the Bhabar. The term Bhur indicates elevated lands along the banks of the river
Ganges. The effl orescence products of alluvium Reh or Kallar, which covers some areas of the
alluvial deposits, are detrimental for irrigation purposes as they destroy agricultural fertility.
In addition to the alluvium, the Pleistocene is also the creator of the desert of Rajasthan,
namely the Thar, formed of windborne sand, stretching from the west of the Aravallis to the
Indus basin and southern confi nes of Punjab. The Pleistocene formed the laterites found in
various places of India by sub-aerial alteration of bauxites, which are used for many purposes
such as construction of roads.
24.10 ECONOMIC RESOURCES FROM ROCK FORMATIONS
‘It is necessary for the students to acquaint with the various minerals products of the rock
systems of India and the economic resources they possess’, observed Wadia (1966). The rock
formations of India yield various types of metallic and non-metallic ores. In addition, minerals
used as precious and semi-precious stones, radioactive minerals, rare minerals, and so forth
and also coal and petroleum are available in the rock formations of India. A review of all these
ores and minerals and also of coal, petroleum, and building stones with respect to the rocks and
location of their occurrence is provided in this section.
24.10.1 Metallic Minerals
India has a large number of economically useful minerals and they constitute one-fourth of
the world’s known mineral resources. The Archaean rocks of India are rich in ore deposits.
Rocks of other types also yield economic minerals. However, coal and petroleum occur only in
sedimentary rock formations.
Gold Gold occurs as native gold associated with quartz vein and also as placer deposit in
sands. The principal gold-bearing rock is found in Kolar district of Mysore where gold occurs
Chapter_24.indd 526 10/18/2012 5:31:06 PM
Physiography, Stratigraphy, and Ores and Minerals of India ● 527
in quartz veins in hornblende schist of Dharwar rock formation. Here, the auriferous veins
contain gold as minute particles. After mining the rock, it is crushed and the crushed materials
are dissolved by the process of amalgamation to extract gold. The Hatti area of Dharwar schist
in Karnataka and Ramgiri in Andhra Pradesh also produce gold to a lesser extent. Placer gold
to a small extent is available from some rivers such as the Subarnarekha of Bihar.
Iron Iron occurs in a large number of deposits in the form of iron oxides (mainly hematite
and magnetite). Iron ores occur in Dharwar and Cuddapah systems of rock formations, the
common rock types being hematite–magnetite–quartz schists. High-grade hematite iron ores
are available in the banded hematite–quartzite of South Singhbhum district of Bihar and
Maurbhanj and Keonjhar of Orissa. In fact, about two-thirds of the country’s iron deposit lies
in a belt along the border of Bihar and Orissa. Other hematite iron ore deposits are found in
Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Goa. Magnetite iron ore is found in Tamil Nadu,
Bihar, and Himachal Pradesh. The Damuda series of rocks in West Bengal also holds valuable
deposits of bedded or precipitated iron ores in the ironstone shale.
Copper Ores of copper occur in Nellore of Tamil Nadu, Khetri and Dariba of Rajasthan,
Singhbhum of Bihar, and in parts of Sikkim and Karnataka. Copper ores are also found in
Madhya Pradesh as veins or dissemination in Dharwar schists and phyllite. The Sikkim deposit
has got prominence and geological similarity with that of the Singhbhum copper ores, being
associated with the Daling schist and phyllite. Presently, copper ores are mined from Mosaboni,
Rakha, and Ghatsila of Bihar. They are found mainly as sulphides (chalcopyrite, malachite,
azurite, and cuprite) in schistose rocks and phyllites. The Khetry deposits of Rajasthan and
Malanjkhand of Madhya Pradesh are also mined giving good productions.
Chromium Chromium ores are available in Singhbhum in Bihar, Cuttack district in Orissa,
Krishna district in Andhra Pradesh, and Mysore and Hassan in Karnataka. Chromium occurs
by magmatic differentiation in n ultrabasic rocks such as dunites, peridotites, and serpentines.
Some chromites occur in Chalk hills (magnesite veins) near Salem. It is used as furnace lining
and also as alloy with steel for chrome steel used in armour plates.
Manganese India has large deposits of manganese next to Russia. The chief centres of
manganese mining by quarrying method are Balaghat, Bhandar, Jabalpur, and Nagpur of
Central India. Visakhapatnam and Gangapur of Orissa and Panchmahal of Maharashtra also
yield manganese. Gondite and Kodurite of Andhra Pradesh and Orissa contain manganese ore
minerals psilomelane, braunite, and pyrolusite. The Dharwar system of rocks (sedimentary
metamorphic) found in Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh also contains manganese ores. Present
manganese mining areas include Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar, and Orissa
Cobalt and nickel Cobalt and nickel are not obtained in India in suffi cient quantities. These
metals are found in copper mines of Khetri and Jaipur of Rajasthan. Nickeliferous pyrrhotite
and chalcopyrite occur in some places in South India but in sparse amount. Nickel ores are also
reported from Cuttack and Maurbhanj in Orissa.
Titanium Ilmenite is the main source of titanium. It occurs as an accessory mineral in igneous
and metamorphic rocks as well as mineral sands. Ilmenite reserves occur in Kerala and along
the sandy beaches of both the east and west coast.
Lead, silver, and zinc ores Galena is the main source of lead and also contains up to one
per cent silver. Besides, anglesite, which is an oxidation product of galena, occurs as lead spar,
Chapter_24.indd 527 10/18/2012 5:31:06 PM
528 ● Engineering Geology
white in colour. The ore also contains zinc to some extent. The rock containing lead ores is
crushed and concentrated by fl oatation process. The top is skimmed off as lead whereas the
leftover part contains signifi cant content of silver. Zinc, which is usually present with lead and
silver, is non-soluble and remains in a separate layer and is easily removed. Rajasthan is the
leading producer of lead of the country. Lead is mined mainly in Zawar, Bhilwara, Rajpura-
Dariba, and Rajsamand areas of Rajasthan. Besides, Surgipalli area in Orissa and Agnigundala
in Andhra Pradesh also mine lead ores. The lead ore galena is found in many places of India
as crystalline schists in parts of Himalayas, Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal, and as veins and
pockets in Vindhyan limestone. Lead ores of Hazaribagh and other places of Bihar and in parts
of Madhya Pradesh are often mixed with a small content of silver (few ounces per tonne).
Aluminium The prime source of aluminium is bauxite, which is its hydrate. Aluminium has
various applications in modern industries such as manufacture of utensils, electrical appliances,
and aeronautical parts. With the discovery of bauxite in the east coast hilltop covering Orissa
and Andhra Pradesh, which has 74 per cent of the total reserve, India is now very rich in
aluminium ore. The estimated reserve in 1970 was 345 million tonnes, which has now come up
to 2000 million tonnes. Prior to fi nding it in the east coast, bauxite as laterite caps was available
in Katni of Jabalpur and the hills of Balaghat in Madhya Pradesh. Other important occurrences
are Kalahandi, Mahabaleshwar, Bhopal, and the Palani hills and some parts of Tamil Nadu and
the Western Ghats.
Tin Occurrence of tin has been reported from gneissic rocks and pegmatite in Palanpur of
Hazaribagh district of Bihar where it is present as cassiterite crystals.
Tungsten Tungsten (wolfram) and antimony ores occur in Nagpur, Tiruchirappalli, and
Rajasthan in gneissic rocks. Tungsten steel is largely used in the manufacture of munitions and
armour plates of heavy guns. Thin wires of tungsten are suitable for and manufactured to use
in electric lamps.
24.10.2 Non-metallic Minerals
Mica India produces three-quarters of the world’s mica (muscovite). Among the non-metallic
minerals, mica is found abundantly in Koderma, Gaya, and Hazaribagh districts of Bihar. High-
quality mica also occurs in Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan.
Kyanite and sillimanite Kyanite and sillimanite are used for refractory purpose as these
minerals can withstand high temperature. These minerals are also used for lining of kilns and
furnaces and for some other purposes in the chemical industry. India has the richest deposits of
kyanite and sillimanite. Kyanite occurs in Lapsa Buru (Kharsawan of Bihar), the largest deposit
in the world. Sillimanite occurs in Sonapahar in Meghalaya and Pipra in Madhya Pradesh in
sillimanite–quartz–schist of Archaean complex.
Graphite Graphite is used for crucibles, blast furnace lining, refractory, and many other
purposes. It occurs in the crystalline metamorphic rocks gneisses and schists as disseminate
fl akes, needles, and grains and also as veins. It is found in various parts of the country such as
Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Orissa, Rajasthan, and Tamil Nadu. In Orissa, it occurs as an
essential constituent of khondalite.
Asbestos Amphibolite and its fi brous variety chrystabolite are used as asbestos. The asbestos
minerals have been found in the pockets of gneisses and solution cavities of soluble rocks in
Chapter_24.indd 528 10/18/2012 5:31:06 PM
Physiography, Stratigraphy, and Ores and Minerals of India ● 529
many places such as Saraikela in Singhbhum. One rich occurrence is in the Archaean rocks of
Ghattihosahalli in Karnataka.
Steatite This mineral is known for its softness and uniform nature. It is soapy to touch and
is also called soap-stone. It has a hardness of one in Mohs scale of hardness. It is used for
manufacturing plates, bowls, and, pots. It occurs in many places in the Archaean and Dharwar
rocks of the peninsula. Workable deposits are found in Bihar, Jabalpur, Salem, and Jaipur.
Barite Barites occur in many places of India as veins and beds of shale in suffi cient quantities.
The chief localities of barite occurrence are Salem in Tamil Nadu and Sleemanasad in Jabalpur.
It also occurs in parts of the Cuddapah basin and it is mined from the Mangampet deposit of
Andhra Pradesh. Barite is used as a pigment for mixing with white lead and as a fl ux in the
smelting of iron and manganese in paper manufacturing and pottery glaze industries.
Uranium Uranium ores are available in Bihar where it is mined from Jaduguda. Pitchblende
occurs in pegmatite veins in the gneisses and schists of the Sengar mica mines in Gaya district
of Bihar. It is associated with uranium minerals. The Gaya pitchblende has also radium content.
Rare minerals The pegmatite veins of the crystalline rocks of India contain a few of what
are called ‘rare minerals’ as accessory minerals. These rare minerals have extended use in the
nuclear industry in the manufacture of special steel and other highly specialized use. Samarskite,
a very rare mineral, is found in the mica-bearing pegmatite of Nellore and in parts of Mysore.
The most common of rare minerals such as monazite, columbite, niobates, and tantalites occur
in the pegmatites of Gaya, Hazaribagh, and Nellore and also parts of Rajasthan and Travancore.
24.10.3 Coal and Petroleum
The Gondwana system is the coal-bearing rock formation of India, which has the world’s largest
deposits of coal. High-grade coal occurs in Jharia and Bokaro of Bihar and Ranigunj coal fi elds
of West Bengal covering the Damodar valley area. Lignite coals are found in Neyveli in Tamil
Nadu. Coal also occurs in the Tertiary sedimentary formations in parts of Assam.
Petroleum deposits are found in Assam and Gujarat. Fresh reserves are located off Mumbai
and petroleum is being raised by offshore drilling from the coast of Mumbai. Tertiary
sedimentary formation is the potential source of petroleum in India found in Assam, Tripura,
and Manipur. Sedimentaries of Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Kutch, and Andaman Islands are
also probable sources of petroleum. A deep-seated deposit of petroleum is expected from the
Krishna and Godavari valley.
24.10.4 Precious and Semi-precious Stones
The Panna diamond belt, which produces diamonds for the country, covers the districts of
Panna, Chhatarpur, and Satna in Madhya Pradesh and some parts of Banda in Uttar Pradesh.
The diamond occurs in the kimberlite rocks in old volcanic pipe.
Crystallized and transparent varieties of corundum of red colour form the highly valued
gem ruby and those of light blue tint form sapphire. These precious stones are available in the
pegmatite of Bihar. They are also found in the terrace debris of Kashmir.
Beryl when transparent and possesses good colour and lustre serves as a high quality
gemstone. The colour varies and has shades of green, blue, and even yellow. The green variety
is the highly priced emerald and the blue is aquamarine. These occur in pegmatite veins in the
Chapter_24.indd 529 10/18/2012 5:31:06 PM
530 ● Engineering Geology
Archaean gneiss of Bihar and Nellore. These gemstones are also reported from Shigar valley
area of Kashmir. In addition, garnets and zircon, which are used as semiprecious stones, are
also available in Bihar.
Precious and semiprecious stones such as garnet, zircon, topaz, and moonstone occur in the
Archaean rocks of Kashmir and Rajasthan to a limited extent.
Rock crystals as crystallized transparent quartz are cut for ornamental objects. The principal
places where crystalline quartz of requisite purity and transparency occur are Thanjavur, Kashmir,
and Jabalpur. Amethyst, which is a rose or purple variety of quartz, is found in Jabalpur and has a
high demand for ornamental use. It occurs mainly in the geodes fi lling up lava cavities.
Various forms of chalcedonic silica, agates, carnelian, bloodstone, onyx, jasper, and so on are
known in the common name of akik (agate) in India. These are available from the amygdaloidal
basalts of the Deccan where these occur as infi lling of the cavities in lavas.
24.10.5 Building Stones
Building stones, which are suitable for engineering constructions, should have some
indispensable qualities. Rocks that can bear the ravages of weather through the ages, possess
the requisite strength and in some cases attractive appearance and tint, and can be dressed
without diffi culties are considered as suitable building stones. Several rock formations of the
country comprise rock types that are quite suitable for building purposes, that is, for use as
rock mass for foundation of engineering structures and as rock fragments for construction
materials.
Granites, gneiss, basalt, marble, limestone, and sandstone are well utilized for building
purposes. Granites and sparsely foliated gneisses are very good building stones possessing high
strength and durability. Indian pink granite and gneisses are highly valued building stones that
have found market in foreign countries also as these can be quarried in large blocks and used
for decorative purposes for wall and fl oor. Many varieties of peninsular gneiss and granite of
the Archaean age are very attractive building stones.
The marble of Rajasthan, especially the milk white marble mined from Makran, is used for
exquisite construction purposes. The Taj Mahal is constructed of this marble. Good quality
marble is also available in Ajmer, Jaipur, Alwar, and few other places of Rajasthan. Dolomite of
Jabalpur is also suitable for use as building stone.
The limestones of Cuddapah, Bijwar, and Aravalli formations are used as building stones.
In addition, good quality limestone for constructive purposes is available in the Vindhyan
formation. The Cretaceous limestone of Tiruchirappalli includes ornamental variety.
The red-coloured Vindhyan sandstone is considered to be very good for architectural
purposes. It was used in the construction of many ancient monuments and royal buildings of
the past. In addition, upper Gondwana sandstone available in Orissa and some other places are
also good building stones.
The basalt of Deccan traps are used in many of the engineering constructions, especially
for highways and railways as detailed in Chapter 19. The laterites of India spread over many
places have been used for roads and other construction purposes for a long time. The slates and
arenaceous phyllites, which split into big slabs, are used in constructing fl oors and walls of
buildings and houses.

Geotechnical Problems of Dams
and Their Solutions
The subject matter of this presentation may be read with Chapter 11 to gain practical
knowledge on geotechnical problems encountered during the construction of some
dams in India and the measures adopted to solve the problems. Instances of failure
of a few dams with causes of failure are also provided. The names of the authors
and their publications consulted in preparing this appendix have been added to
‘References’ at the end of the book.
A.1 DAMS FOUNDED ON IGNEOUS ROCKS
This section discusses some dam projects that have been founded on igneous rocks.
A.1.1 Koyna Dam and Reservoir Project, Maharashtra
The Koyna hydroelectric project of Maharashtra includes a 104 m-high and 853
m-long rubble concrete dam constructed across the river Koyna, a tributary of the
river Krishna. It is a reservoir of capacity about 2890 million cubic metres and
consists of a head race tunnel, a tail race tunnel, and a powerhouse to generate 540
MW power. The dam site consists of the basalt of the Deccan trap overlain by nearly
30 m thick cover of laterite and lateritic soil. The basalt of the dam site represents
three distinct massive lava beds separated by tuff breccia, vesicular basalt, ash,
and red bole, which contributed to the weakness of the bedrock. The basalt is also
jointed at places and shows presence of several shear zones. All these weak zones
posed problems of settlement, seepage, and uplift of the dam.
The shear zones and clay seams in the basalt of the foundation were scooped
out and backfi lled by concrete. Anchor rods were embedded as grout buttons along
the walls of the weak zones. In the right abutment, the red bole layers and the
tuff breccia were treated by a cut-off followed by effective grouting. Consolidation
grouting was done to a depth of 7.6 m in the weak patches of foundation followed
by curtain grouting to arrest problems of settlement, uplift, and seepage.
The reservoir area the Koyna project lies within the peninsular shield, which
is considered to be a stable landmass. However, since 1962—when water was
impounded in the reservoir—the project had experienced frequent low-intensity
earthquakes. In 1967, major earthquakes of intensity measuring 5.0 to 6.3 in the
Richter scale damaged parts of the Koyna township and underground power plant,
though the dam, designed with a seismic factor of 0.05g, could withstand the shock.
The dam was strengthened by buttress, cabling, and grouting to protect it from high-
intensity tremors (Srinivasan 1975).
Appendix A.indd 533 10/18/2012 12:45:26 PM
534 ● Engineering Geology
A.1.2 Ukai Multipurpose Dam Project, Gujarat
A 68 m-high and 4928 m-long composite dam (earth-cum-masonry) has been constructed
across the river Tapti under Ukai project to irrigate a vast area of Gujarat and to generate
300 MW power besides fl ood moderation. The dam site comprises Deccan basalt intruded by
dykes of dolerite and gabbro, which occur under thick overburden materials of sand, gravel,
and boulders of 10 m thickness in the river section. In the earth dam portion, two rows of
grout curtains were extended to a depth of 15 m below the cut-off trench. The unconsolidated
material of the river section was treated by a positive cut-off to a depth of 25 m by placing
concrete diaphragm. The shear zones in the rocks of the earth dam foundation were grouted,
the average grout intake being 57 kg/m.
In the 905 m-long masonry dam section, the main defects of the foundation rock included
sheeted joints, shear zones, and deep weathering of dolerite. Consolidation grouting was
undertaken to strengthen these weak zones. The two red bole zones were excavated to a depth
of 3.4 m and backfi lled with concrete. In the spillway portion, the rocks were grouted with
deep holes to strengthen the contact zones of dykes with basalt. In addition, grout curtains
were undertaken from the inspection gallery, and drain holes were provided to relieve the
undue uplift pressure. In the design of the dam, a seismic coeffi cient of 0.10g was adopted
to withstand earthquake shocks. The Ukai dam encountered the problem of scouring due to
huge fl ood discharge in 1969 and again in the subsequent years. The dam was then anchored
by steel grip rods embedded in concrete to protect the structure from scouring (Mahendra and
Mathur 1975).
A.2 DAMS BUILT ON SEDIMENTARY ROCKS
Some of the dams built on sedimentary rocks are briefl y described in this section.
A.2.1 Rana Pratap Sagar Dam, Rajasthan
The Rana Pratap Sagar project utilizes water from the river Chambal by means of a 54 m-high
and 1143 m-long masonry dam constructed across this river, a powerhouse at the toe of the dam,
and other ancillary structures for power generation and irrigation of large areas of Rajasthan and
Madhya Pradesh. The dam site consists of horizontally bedded Vindhyan sandstone and shale.
The rocks are folded and the fold axis runs across the dam alignment. Several shear zones of
thickness 2.5–3 cm traverse the foundation rocks. In the left bank, slump features are seen in shale
and glide cracks in sandstone.
The horizontal disposition of the sandstone and shale with clay seams, presence of thin shear
zones along the bedding, block jointing in sandstone, and susceptibility of the downstream
rocks to scouring posed the problems of differential settlement, leakage, and toe erosion. The
clay seams occurring up to 3.3 m below the foundation were treated by two cut-off trenches,
one in the toe and another in the heel of the dam, followed by intensive grouting between the
two trenches.
In the spillway foundation, two rows of anchor rods spaced at 1.2 m intervals were embedded
3 m inside the foundation rock to resist shearing along the dam length. In addition, a key trench
was dug at the toe of the dam. In the downstream bucket portion, a reinforced cement concrete
(RCC) raft was tied to the underlying sandstone to prevent scouring from the thrust of the
spillway water. As remedial measures against slumps and cracks of the left bank and against
slide, the steep ground of this part was fl attened and a clay blanket was provided, and in some

Geotechnical Problems of Dams and Their Solutions ● 535
places retaining walls were constructed. In addition, consolidation grouting was adopted up to
a depth of 9 m in the foundation (Sanganeria 1975).
A.2.2. Srisailam Dam, Andhra Pradesh
The Srisailam dam in Andhra Pradesh is a 139 m-high masonry construction across the river
Krishna. The dam site is a classic example of the problems encountered in construction on
sedimentary rocks. A narrow gorge is created due to the presence of soft shale that undergoes
easy weathering. Nearly horizontal beds of quartzite and shale are the main rock types of the
dam site. The 0.4–2 m-thick massive quartzite bed possesses high strength; however, the shale
in the abutment is of very low strength and the undersaturated condition causes it to disintegrate
when even a low pressure is applied. Underlying the massive quartzite of the river section, there
are fi ssile quartzite and sandy shale having clay seams along the bedding planes.
The main foundation defects were low strength of the abutment shale and a 3 m-thick highly
weathered quartzite bed in the right abutment, block jointing of the quartzite, and sliding due
to the low dip (3°–7°) of the beds having several clay seams. As a remedial measure, a 60
m-long drift was driven, and the soft shale beds were mined out and later fi lled with concrete.
An impervious clay blanket was provided in the upstream parts. The block joints were treated
by stage drilling and grouting over the entire foundation at 3 m intervals. A 30 m-wide RCC
anchor block was provided at the toe and the dam was constructed as a single monolith structure
to arrest any possible slides (Rao and Narasimham 1975).
A.3 DAMS FOUNDED ON METAMORPHIC ROCKS
This section deals with some dams that were founded on metamorphic rocks.
A.3.1 Idukki Dam, Kerala
The 167 m-high Idukki thin concrete arch dam with crest length of 365 m is only one of its kind
in India and is one of the largest arch dams in the world. The dam is constructed across the river
Periyar in Kerala in a ‘V’-shaped gorge section where the river takes an acute bend and is very
constricted. The word Idukki means ‘constriction’ in the local language. The cord–height ratio
of the gorge section at the dam site is 2 : 1, which offers an ideal site for the arch dam.
The entire gorge section including the river bed and the abutments consists of hard charnockite.
Exploratory work also proved the presence of hard and sound charnockite at depth. The only
unfavourable feature was a hump in the left abutment that separated the underlying rock by a
joint plane, creating a possibility of slide. A wing wall was provided at this part to relieve the
arch from water load and to avoid the anticipated tensile stress. The hump was kept in position
by an anchor bolt. Rock bolting in three rows was also undertaken in the dam site rocks to a
depth of 6 m with spacing of 1.5 m to avoid any chance of movement of spherical rock bodies
present in parts of the abutments (Seshagiri 1975).
A.3.2 Umiam Dam Project, Meghalaya
The Umiam hydroelectric project of Meghalaya includes a 72 m-high and 170 m-long concrete
dam constructed across the river Umiam along with other appurtenant structures for generation
of power. The rocks present at the dam site are quartzite and phyllite of Shillong series that
occur in the syncline of a regional fold. The quartzites possess high strength but the phyllites
occur in two varieties, the arenaceous type with high strength and the argillaceous type with
Appendix A.indd 535 10/18/2012 12:45:26 PM
536 ● Engineering Geology
low strength. The central part of the dam foundation is traversed by a 3 m-wide fault and several
other minor faults and shear zones, open joints, and soft phyllite bands, which are the main
defective features of the dam foundation.
The main fault zone and the minor faults were treated by scooping out the soft and crushed rock
to a formula depth (generally two to three times the width) from the fault planes and backfi lling
with concrete. Grouting was carried out from both sides of the main fault zone by inclined grout
holes. The highly jointed portion of the quartzites and the soft phyllites of the foundation were
excavated until better rocks were available, which were then grouted to strengthen the foundation.
Field load test was carried out to confi rm that the soft phyllites attained suffi cient strength to
bear the thrust of the dam under reservoir condition. The dam site situated close to Shillong, the
capital of Meghalaya, was affected by the earthquake of 1897 and the Assam earthquake of 1950.
A seismic factor of 0.18g for horizontal and 0.12g for vertical was incorporated in the design of
the dam (Gangopadhyay 1973).
A.4 DAMS CONSTRUCTED ON HETEROGENEOUS ROCKS
Some of the dams constructed on heterogeneous rocks are discussed in this section.
A.4.1 Hirakud Dam, Orissa
The 64 m-high Hirakud dam with a river bed spillway and nearly 4.8 km-long earthen section
is constructed across the river Mahanadi in Orissa. Archaean biotite gneiss and granitoid with
mica schist are present in parts of the river bed and in the left bank. The right bank consists of
arkose, quartzite, slate, and shale of Cuddapahs. The contact of the Archaean and the Cuddapahs
is faulted. The geological problems include deep weathering, the presence of a 6 m wide zone
of shattered rock in the rocks of the left bank, and a fault that affected the rocks in a part of the
spillway foundation.
The weak rocks of the foundation were excavated until sound rock was obtained. The fault
zone was treated by scooping out the shattered rocks up to a depth of 3 m and further removing
the clay gouge for a depth of twice its width and backfi lling by concrete. A cut-off trench was
provided at the upstream part. In addition, clay blanketing was adopted for a distance of 90 m
on the upstream part covering the fault zone. In the earth dam section, a 4.5 m-deep cut-off
trench and a curtain up to 9.5 m depth were provided from the bottom of the trench.
The dam suffered from post-construction distress due to alkali–aggregate reaction of the
concrete used in the construction. Horizontal cracks up to 9 mm in width and extended to a
depth of 2 m developed in the concreted vertical face of the right spillway and right foundation
gallery. The river shingle containing quartzite and crushed rock aggregate were identifi ed as
reactive. The remedial measures taken up include grouting the body of the dam, sealing the
cracks of the upstream face, and reinstalling porous drains in the body of the dam (Ramchandran
and Gangopadhyay 1972).
A.4.2 Tenughat Dam, Bihar
At the Tenughat dam in Hazaribagh district of Bihar, a 51 m-high and 6097 m-long rolled
earth-fi lled dam has been built across the river Damodar accommodating a 188 m-long masonry
spillway in the right bank. The reservoir supplies water (25 m3/s) to the Bokaro steel plant
and ancillary structures. The dam rests partly on interbedded sandstone and shales of the
Lower Gondwana formation and partly on the Archaean crystalline consisting of schist, gneiss,
Appendix A.indd 536 10/18/2012 12:45:26 PM
Geotechnical Problems of Dams and Their Solutions ● 537
and amphibolite. The spillway structure in the masonry portion of the dam has been located
confi ning mostly within a 30 m wide band of amphibolite.
The boundary fault between the Archaean and the Gondwana rocks is aligned normal to
the dam axis and consists of crushed rocks with clay gouge affecting the dam foundation.
Numerous clay lenses are present in the rocks of the left bank, which posed the problem of
settlement by liquefaction. To prevent leakage through the fault, a 20 m-deep cut-off and a
1.5 m-thick clay blanket extending to a length of 150 m towards upstream side were provided.
In addition, 18 m-deep grouting was undertaken underneath the cut-off.
In the foundation rocks of the masonry section of the dam, some soft and jointed bands of
schistose rocks were present, which led to the problem of stability. To provide safety to the
dam, the following remedial measures were taken up: an upstream curvature was provided to
the spillway, a monolithic block spanning the entire soft mica schist band was erected, and a
9 m deep key trench was excavated and backfi lled with reinforced concrete. In addition, blanket
and curtain grouting were undertaken to a depth of 9 m covering a distance of 13 m of spillway
length to consolidate the foundation and contain leakage. Later, high-pressure grouting was
carried out from the foundation gallery to provide a single row curtain extending to a depth of
24 m (Chowdhury 1975).
A.5 DAMS BUILT IN HIMALAYAN TERRAIN
This section gives a brief description of some dams built in the Himalayan terrain.
A.5.1 Bhakra–Nangal Dam
The Bhakra–Nangal complex, with the main dam at Bhakra, a barrage at Nangal, two
powerhouses, and other ancillary structures including a network of irrigation canals, is one of
the largest multipurpose projects of the world. The Bhakra dam constructed across the river
Sutlej is a 226 m-high, 518 m-long concrete dam. It is founded on the Lower Siwalik sandstone
interbedded with siltstone and claystone dipping steeply towards downstream. A clay band
known as heel claystone occurs at a depth of 150 m below the dam foundation. The rocks of the
dam site have been affected by a fault and several large shear zones.
The foundation treatment included the excavation of the hill claystone and backfi lling with
concrete. A 15 m-thick concrete slab was provided to act as a strut to block the heel claystone.
The bedding shear zones and the claystone–siltstone members were excavated to formula depth
and backfi lled by pre-cooled concrete. The foundation rocks were further strengthened by
grouting. In the post-construction stage, some cracks developed in the heel claystone strut with
consequent leakage. The gallery cracks and other defects were fi nally corrected by concrete
plugging.
The 27 m-high Nangal barrage constructed downstream of the Bhakra dam rests on pervious
terrace gravels overlying the boulder conglomerate bed of the Upper Siwalik formation. Problem
of leakage through the foundation of pervious terrace gravel was checked by providing grout
curtain extended down to the boulder conglomerate, which is hardened to a great extent by
siliceous matrix. Drainage holes were also provided to relieve the uplift pressure (Hukku 1975).
A.5.2 Ranjit Sagar (Thein) Dam, Punjab
The Ranjit Sagar (Thein) multipurpose dam project of Gurudaspur district in Punjab consists
of an earth-cum-rock-fi ll dam 160 m high and 600 m long, located across the river Ravi in the
Appendix A.indd 537 10/18/2012 12:45:26 PM
538 ● Engineering Geology
Siwalik range of the Outer Himalayas. The project includes a powerhouse of 600 MW capacity
and four 12 m-diameter tunnels of which two tunnels are being used as power tunnels and two
as irrigation tunnels. Located along a natural saddle at the left bank, the dam is provided with
a 133 m-wide chute spillway comprising an ogee crest along with a desilting basin and a roller
bucket.
The dam site comprises alternate sequence of sandstone and claystone/siltstone of the Lower
Siwalik formation of Miocene age. Due to the presence of soft rocks in the dam site and high
seismicity of the project area (seismic zone V), an earth-cum-rock-fi ll dam has been constructed.
A seismic coeffi cient of 0.15g (horizontal) and 0.075g (vertical) acting simultaneously at the
centre of gravity of the load has been adopted in the design. An upstream inclined clay core of
thickness 0.5H, one line grout curtain of depth one-third the dam height plus 15 m, and drainage
galleries on both abutments have been provided to check piping and uplift. In addition, blanket
grouting was taken up to the base of the dam core to strengthen the soft and open jointed rocks
of the foundation (ISEG News 2001).
A.6 INSTANCES OF DAM FAILURES
This section provides some instances of dam failure.
A.6.1 Tigra Dam, Madhya Pradesh
The Tigra dam in Madhya Pradesh is a typical example of dam failure due to geological reasons.
It was one of the oldest dams in India constructed in 1917 across the river Sank. The dam
was a masonry gravity structure, 25 m high and 1.8 m long, and was made of hand-chiselled
sandstone blocks. It was founded on sandstone alternated with thin beds of shale dipping at a
low angle towards the downstream.
The dam was breached in several blocks immediately after fi lling of the reservoir. The
breach was nearly 400 m across. The failure mechanism includes percolation of water through
the joints in rocks that aided creation of the uplift pressure. The low dipping beds of foundation
rocks lubricated by the water gave easy passage for sliding of the masonry block along the
bedding planes. A fl ood discharge of about 8500 m3/s with a water head of 400 m length fl owed
over the ungated dam. The force of the rushing water was so high that several masonry blocks
were bodily lifted and pushed to a distance of 14 m from the dam. The failure was purely due
to the adverse geological features of the dam foundation coupled with overtopping caused by
fl ood (Mehta and Pradhan 1972).
A.6.2 Kedarnala Dam, Madhya Pradesh
The 22 m-high Kedarnala earth dam in Raigarh district, Madhya Pradesh, failed within a few
months of its construction due to the adverse geological condition of the dam site. The dam
was founded on quartzitic sandstone with shale intercalation. On 6 July 1964, immediately after
fi lling of the reservoir, muddy water fl owed out from the boulder toe junction with the ground.
Leakage then started from the embankment slope above the boulder toe level and the quantity
of the discharge increased and the dam was breached coinciding with continuous rainfall to an
extent of 408 cm within a period of 13 hours.
A porous sand zone in the foundation rock that remained untreated during the foundation
treatment served as the avenue of water leakage through the foundation and created uplift
pressure causing the breakage. The differential settlement in the earthwork due to poor
Appendix A.indd 538 10/18/2012 12:45:26 PM
Geotechnical Problems of Dams and Their Solutions ● 539
compaction of the earth section coupled with heavy and continuous downpour is considered to
be the contributory factor for the dam failure (Mehta and Pradhan 1972).
A.6.3 Khadakwasla Dam, Maharashtra
The Khadakwasla dam near Pune in Maharashtra was constructed in 1879 as a masonry gravity
structure founded on hard rock. The supply from the stored water was used mainly for irrigation
purpose. The dam had a height of 31.25 m above the river bed. Its crest length was 1.71 m and it
had a free board of 2.74 m. The dam had a fl ood capacity of 2775 m3/s and a reservoir capacity
of 103 m3.
A breach in an upstream dam (Panshet dam) and the release of excessively large volume of
water from the storage of that dam to Khadakwasla reservoir caused overtopping of the dam as
the volume of infl ow was much above the designed fl ood. The battering of the incoming fl ood
caused vibration of the dam, and the dam failed within four hours of the additional delivery of
fl ood water from the Panshet dam. The Khadakwasla masonry gravity dam that had irrigated
the land for more than eight decades (1879–1961) is considered to be the fi rst of its kind in the
world (Thandaveswara 2008).

Geotechnical Problems of Tunnels
and Their Solutions
This presentation includes geological weaknesses encountered and the measures
adopted for their treatment towards safe construction of some tunnels in India
and as such it will be proper to study this subject matter with Chapter 13. Readers
interested in a detailed study may consult the publications given in the references
for each case study.
B.1 HARD ROCK TUNNELLING
This section deals with some of the problems encountered in tunnelling through
hard rocks.
B.1.1 Water Conductor Tunnel, Stage I, Umiam Project, Meghalaya
The 3 m-diameter and 2.1 km-long tunnel under stage I of the Umiam hydroelectric
project of Meghalaya pierces through quartzite, phyllite, and metamorphosed
conglomerate and meta-dolerite of the Shillong series. A thick band of extensively
jointed meta-dolerite having intrusive relationship with the quartzites occurs at the
central part of the tunnel. The entire rock types are folded and jointed to some
extent. A fault and several shear zones also cut across the tunnel rocks.
Insuffi cient rock cover above the tunnel grade covering a 60 m stretch, presence
of numerous shear zones, spheroidal weathering, and constant infi ltration of
surface water through joints in meta-dolerite of this part resulted in roof collapse.
Subsequently, several slides affected the wall rocks during heavy rains. The rock
slides could be fi nally arrested by confi ning the excavation and debris clearance
works within the dry season (winter) and providing immediate reinforced cement
concrete (RCC) cover to the roof and concrete lining to the wall rocks.
There was another major setback in tunnelling. At a distance of about 300 m
from the outlet portal, porous sandstone charged with groundwater caused a large
quantity of water to gush out with silt and sand that piled up and completely chocked
the outlet end for six months. After the water fl ow was reduced to some extent in the
dry season, the sandy debris was cleared off and consolidation grouting was carried
out in the sandstone bed. Thick RCC lining was then provided in the affected part
and the tunnel was made through (Gangopadhyay 1967).
B.1.2 Head Race Tunnel, Balimela Multipurpose Project, Orissa
The 7.6 m-diameter and 3.99 km-long water conductor (head race tunnel) of
Balimela multipurpose project is located in the Eastern Ghats for carrying water

Geotechnical Problems of Tunnels and Their Solutions ● 541
impounded behind a 73 m-high earth dam, constructed across the river Sileru in Koraput district
in Orissa for generation of 480 MW power. The tunnel passes through hard charnockite and
pyroxene granulite thinly interbanded with basic igneous rocks and some pegmatite veins.
The tunnel rocks are without any major structural defects but contain joints and shear zones
at some stretches, but no treatment was initially undertaken there. However, 14 stretches of
jointed and sheared rocks were later required to be treated by reinforced lining and high-
pressure grouting. The single stretch of these treated portions varied between 8 m and 42 m in
length. The total length of treatment required in tunnel rock was 322 m, the thickness of lining
in each stretch being 30 cm to 60 cm (Sinha, Pradhan, and Singh 1971).
B.2 SOFT ROCK TUNNELLING
In this section, some of the problems that were experienced when tunnelling through soft rocks
are discussed.
B.2.1 Water Conductor Tunnel, Rana Pratap Sagar Multipurpose Project, Rajasthan
The Rana Pratap Sagar project of Rajasthan is constituted of a high dam constructed across
the river Chambal and a 1466 m-long and 12.9-m (base width) horseshoe-shaped tunnel. The
water conductor tunnel located in the left bank of the river passes through Vindhyan sandstone
containing several thin beds of ferruginous siltstone and shales. At places, 1 cm to 5 cm thick
silt and clay seams occur interlayered with the sandstone. Water seeps through these interlayer
zones. Heavy seepage was detected when the tunnel passed through the inlet portal where the
sandstone contains numerous clay seams.
Two sets of intersected joints are the main structural elements of the sandstone. A portion of
the tunnel roof experienced overbreaks due to this geological defect (joints in rock), but in other
places overbreaks were the result of heavy blasting. The normal overbreak was only 2 per cent
to 5 per cent. The tunnel was lined to a thickness of 45 cm by RCC only to minimize frictional
losses, as otherwise the tunnel could be kept unlined. The grout consumption was negligible
and has no correlation with the openness of joints in tunnel rocks (Sanganeria 1975).
B.2.2 Water Conductor Tunnel, Ramganga Project, Uttar Pradesh
Located in the Himalayan terrain in Uttar Pradesh, the Ramganga project constitutes a 124
m-high rock-fi ll dam across the river Ramganga and a water conductor system characterized
by two tunnels. One of these is a 1 km-long and 9 m-diameter circular tunnel, and the other is
a power tunnel. The two tunnels pass through alternative beds of sand-rock and clay shale of
Siwalik formation. The rocks, affected by two thrusts, namely Dagshais and Krols, are loosely
cemented and porous in nature, possessing low strength. The clay shale bed consisting of
several thin siltstone and plastic clay seams occupies 25 per cent of the tunnel length. All the
rocks are traversed by several sets of joints.
The tunnel is aligned at a right angle to the bedding strike. A pilot tunnel driven along
the power tunnel indicated seepage of water from several places, especially from the contact
planes of sand-rock and clay shale. During tunnelling, roof falls took place affecting the rock
up to a height of 5 m from the crown. Since the rocks had very low tensile strength, immediate
supports were provided to protect such large overbreaks. Close-spaced (0.6 m intervals)
supports were provided covering the entire length of the clay shale rock. Unsaturated ground
slope, consisting of sand-rock at the two portal ends, posed the problem of slope failure where
Appendix B.indd 541 10/18/2012 12:46:19 PM
542 ● Engineering Geology
the ground was stabilized by providing 3 m-wide berms at every 15 m height of the slope
(Varma and Mehta 1971).
B.3 TUNNELLING IN HIMALAYAN TERRAIN
This section discusses the diffi culties faced when tunnelling through the Himalayan terrain.
B.3.1 Head Race and Tail Race Tunnels, Jaldhaka Project, West Bengal
The Jaldhaka project of Darjeeling Himalayan region consists of schist and gneiss that occur
under a thick cover of unconsolidated terrace deposit. All the rocks are tectonically disturbed
due to folding, thrusting, intense shearing, and jointing. The 3.39 km-long head race tunnel
pierces through schists, gneisses, and sheared quartzites. Overbreaks including huge roof
collapse in the form of chimneys were of frequent nature and mainly found where quartzite
contains close-spaced joints, crushed rocks, and clay gouge. Fore-polling with steel piles was
adopted to cross the affected zone by tunnelling.
The 420 m-long tail race tunnel passes through biotite schist, mica gneiss, quartzite, and
amphibolite traversed by several quartz veins. Overbreaks including formation of chimneys as
high as 4.6 m were formed at the intersections of two major joints and where rocks were affected
by shear zones. Infi ltration of water through the weak planes further aggravated the problem of
overbreak. Intensive rock support and adoption of fore-polling aided the completion of the tunnel.
In Jaldhaka project, heavy overbreaks from roof and collapse of side walls had taken place
covering a large stretch where the tunnel passes parallel to the foliation planes. Another diffi culty
was constant seepage of water that lubricated the weak planes and removed the infi lling material
from them. Adequate drainage arrangement and cautious approach by advance providing of
structurally affected zones helped averting all these tunnelling hazards and the entire tunnel
works could be completed safely (Chatterjee and Gangopadhyay 1971).
B.3.2 Banihal (Jawahar) Traffi c Tunnel, Jammu and Kashmir
The Jammu–Srinagar highway is connected by the Banihal tunnel, which is a combination of two
tunnels, each 2.54 km long and horseshoe shaped (5.5 m base width). The Banihal tunnel pierces
through the snow-covered Pir Panjal range comprising agglomeratic slate, trap rocks (basalt with
tuff), and limestone. The excavation work started by driving a pilot tunnel. The trap rocks, as a
result of extensive joints, resulted in overbreaks in all parts. In limestone, seepage of water was the
main problem. Presence of springs along the tunnel line also led to the problem of water fl owage.
Rock bolting without netting, and at places with netting, had to be undertaken covering
the roof and weak zones to prevent overbreaks. Most parts comprising the trap rocks were,
however, kept unlined. Due to the soft and weak nature of the agglomeratic slate, the entire
portion of the tunnel comprising this rock was lined. The spring water was diverted to the
sides by longitudinal drains and lining was provided as remedial measures in the tunnel stretch
comprising limestone. As the area is under a high seismic zone, articulated joints comprising
copper sheets with shalite were placed on both walls to prevent rupture of concrete lining
(Ramchandran and Gangopadhyay 1972).
B.4 SOFT GROUND TUNNELLING—KOLKATA METRO RAILWAY TUNNEL
The 16.5 km-long railway tunnel of Kolkata passes through alluvial soil. The soil investigation
indicated two types of soil, namely river channel deposit and normal Kolkata deposit. The river
Appendix B.indd 542 10/18/2012 12:46:19 PM
Geotechnical Problems of Tunnels and Their Solutions ● 543
channel deposit type of sub-soil consists of grey coloured silt and fi ne- to medium-grained sand
down to 55 m from surface level with top 4 m to 5m of the deposit having more clay. The soil
of normal Kolkata deposit contains light brown silty clay mixed with decomposed woods at 8
m to 9 m and calcareous nodules at 5 m to 6 m depths.
The analyses of soil samples showed the average properties as density 1.34 tonnes/m3,
cohesion 0.38 kg/m2, and angle of internal friction 4°. The groundwater table is measured
between 5 m and 6 m depths. Perched water table is recorded in some localities at shallower
levels. Kolkata falls under seismic zone III and a horizontal seismic coeffi cient range
0.04–0.06g was considered in the design.
The tunnel was constructed mainly by cut and cover method and partly by shield tunnelling.
In the cut and cover method, two vertical retaining walls were made 10 m apart to support the
ground with adjoining structures. The soil between the walls was then dug out to depths of 12 m
to 14 m and 19 m at station areas. After completion of digging, RCC box was provided in the
pit and the top part was backfi lled for restoration of road.
Shield tunnelling involved four operations: construction of tunnel shafts, introduction and
operation of shield, excavation of earth, and grouting and lining. The shield method helped
controlling the shape and size of the tunnel and ensured safety of working men and machinery.
The main problem faced was ground stability. The soft soil tried to squeeze into the shield face,
threatening ground collapse and subsidence. Use of compressed air helped to support the face
and solved the problem (Sengupta 1991).

Glossary
Abyssal plain An extremely smooth portion of the deep sea fl oor. The gradient
across the abyssal plains falls within the range of 1:1000 to 1:10,000. This fact is
known from deep sea photographs and high-precision sounding techniques.
Acid rock The dominant chemical constituent of igneous rocks is silica, which
ranges between 35 per cent and 75 per cent (by weight). The rocks are classifi ed
into: acid > 66 per cent, intermediate 55–66 per cent, basic 45–55 per cent, and
ultrabasic < 45 per cent.
Amygdale A rounded mass of mineral formed in a gas cavity in a volcanic rock,
a rock that solidifi ed before all the gas bubbled out.
Anticline An arch-shaped fold into which rock strata have been compressed, the
oldest rocks occurring in the core. The strata on either side dip away from each
other.
Aquifer Soil or rock layer (stratum) in which the groundwater fl ows easily.
Typically, aquifers consist of coarse-grained soils or fractured rock.
Aquitard Soil or rock layer (stratum) that restricts or prevents the movement of
subsurface water. Typically, aquitards consist of fi ne-grained soils such as silts and
clays or sound rock without any fractures.
Asthenosphere A zone within the earth’s upper mantle in which the velocity
of seismic waves is considerably reduced. Movement between the earth’s outer
lithosphere and inner mesosphere is thought to take place along this zone, which is
capable of prolonged plastic deformation.
Atterberg limits The liquid limit, plastic limit, and shrinkage limit for soil. The
water content at which the soil behaviour changes from the liquid to the plastic state
is the liquid limit, from the plastic to the semisolid state is the plastic limit, and from
the semisolid to the solid state is the shrinkage limit.
Basic rock Descriptive term for igneous rocks containing 45–55 per cent silica by
weight, (also called mafi c).
Bearing capacity The pressure that can be imposed by a foundation onto the soil
or rock supporting the foundation.
Bed A stratum or single distinct sheet-like layer of sedimentary rock.

Bed load Particles dragged, rolled, or bounced along during transport by wind or water.
Brittle Deformation of rock by fracturing.
Caisson A large structural chamber used to keep soil and water from entering into a deep
excavation or construction area. Caisson may be installed by being sunk in place or by
symmetrically excavating below the bottom unit to the desired depth.
Caldera A volcanic crater more than 1 km across formed by subsidence of fl oor during an
eruption.
Chemical weathering The process of weathering whereby chemical reactions such as
hydration, solution, oxidation, and ion exchange break down and possibly change rock and soil
materials.
Cleavage Regular planes of weakness in a crystal that are a consequence of its atomic structure.
Compaction The process of increasing the density or unit weight of soil (frequently fi ll soil)
by rolling, vibrating, or other mechanical means.
Conchoidal Describing the smoothly curved, glasslike character of a fracture (broken
surface) marked by concentric arcuate ridges common to many minerals, for example, quartz.
Consolidation The process by which compression of a newly stressed clay soil occurs
simultaneously with the expulsion of water present in the soil void spaces. Initially, the newly
imposed stress acting on the clay is imparted onto the water in the soil voids (pore water), and
not onto the soil particles. Because of the increased pressure, water is gradually forced out of
the soil. As the pore water pressure is reduced, the magnitude of the stress being imposed onto
the soil particles is correspondingly increased. Compression of clay layer occurs only as rapidly
as pore water can drain from the soil and this is related to the permeability of the clay layer.
Continental drift The relative movement of continental blocks across the surface of the earth
as a result of sea fl oor spreading. The hypothesis of continental drift was proposed in the early
1900s, but only with the advent of plate tectonics later, the theory was accepted to be a viable
mechanism for the movement of continents.
Craton A stable area of continental crust, also known as a shield, which has remained
undeformed since the Archaen time.
Cross bedding Sedimentary beds with development of internal lamination within a stratum
inclined at an angle to the main bedding planes, resulting from changes in the direction of water
or wind currents during deposition.
Crystal A solid substance formed by a repeating, three-dimensional pattern of atoms of
various elements. Most minerals are present in crystalline forms.
Density The mass per unit volume. In reference to soil, the term often also indicates unit
volume and is synonymous with unit weight.
Dip The angle between the horizontal plane and a geological surface, such as a bedding plane.
Drawdown The lowering of the level of groundwater table that occurs in the vicinity of a
water well (on dewatering equipment) when it is pumped.

Earthquake The shaking of the ground caused by a sudden movement within the earth due
to the release of energy that occurs as a result of deep rock fracturing or shifting, volcanic
eruption, or a large explosion.
Epicentre The point on the earth’s surface directly above an earthquake’s focus.
Expansive clay Clay soils that experience signifi cant volume expansion in the presence of
water and shrink upon drying. Clays including the montmorillonite minerals are especially
noted for their volume change characteristics.
Fault A fracture in the earth’s crust along the plane of which there has been displacement of
rock on one side relative to the other.
Floodplain Flat low-lying ground besides a river over which it fl oods after heavy rainfall.
The course of a river tends to migrate to and fro across its fl ood plain over tens of thousands
of years.
Focus The breakpoint at which earthquake motion begins and where most of the energy is
released.
Fold Buckling of bedded sedimentary rocks due to deformation processes.
Foliation A banded or laminated structure within a metamorphic rock caused by the alignment
of minerals in layers by regional metamorphism.
Footing A type of foundation typically installed as a shallow depth and constructed to provide
a relatively large area of bearing onto the supporting soil.

Graben A down-dropped crust segment, such as the great rift in Central Africa.
Groundwater table The surface of the underground supply of water. It is also referred to as
the phreatic surface.
Hanging wall The surface of rock above a fault plane.
Heave Upward movement of the soil and the foundations supported on soil, caused by
expansion occurring in the soil as a result of factors such as freezing or swelling due to
increased water content. Frost heave refers to the vertical soil movement that occurs in freezing

Glossary ● 547
Hydraulic gradient Mathematical term indicating the difference in pressure head existing
between two locations divided by the distance between these locations. It is designated by the
symbol i.
Hydrolysis Chemical breakdown of minerals to dry particles by the action of slightly acidic
water during weathering.
Intrusive Describing magma (molten rock) or rock formed from magma that hardened before
reaching the surface, forced into cracks or layers between existing rocks and characterized by
larger crystals than extrusive rock.
Joint A smooth fracture through a body of rock caused by release of pressure or cooling.
There is no movement between the opposite sides of a joint.
Karst Topography that develops over soluble limestone and dolomite, characterized by
sinkholes and fl uted limestone remains.
Laccolith A concordant intrusive igneous body with a dyke-like feeder, usually forming small
lens-like features less than 5 km in diameter. It has a fl at base but the upper surface is convex.
Liquefaction Loss of strength occurring in saturated cohesionless soil exposed to shock or
vibration when the soil particles momentarily loose contact. The materials then behave as a
fl uid.
Magma Molten rocks; usually used to refer to molten rock at depth, whereas molten rock at
the surface is called lava.
Malleable Can be fl attened out by pounding, a characteristic of native metals and of the
metals freed from ores.
Matrix The fi ne-grained material that surrounds larger crystals, pebbles, or fossils in rock,
especially sedimentary rock.
Mechanical weathering The process of weathering whereby physical forces, such as frost
action and temperature changes, break down or reduce rock to smaller fragments without
involving chemical change.
Metamorphism The process of changing pre-existing igneous and sedimentary rocks
without melting under condition of high temperature and/or pressure. Thermal or contact
metamorphism is a result of proximity to an igneous intrusion. Regional metamorphism is a
result of burial to great depth.
Mineral A naturally occurring crystalline substance with a well-defi ned chemical composition.
Monocline A bending of rock strata produced in sedimentary sequence that has deformed
under conditions favouring the formation of normal fault.
Normal fault A fault showing displacement in the down-dip direction of the fault. This
results from a stress condition in which the principal maximum stress is vertical and the other
two principal stresses are horizontal.
Orogeny A mountain building episode, resulting from a collision between two continents or
between a continent and an island arc.

548 ● Engineering Geology
Outcrop The area on the earth’s surface where a particular rock type or rock body is present.
Overlap The deposition of beds lying above an unconformity, where they were deposited by
the transgressing sea.
Oxbow lake A crescent-shaped lake occupying an abandoned channel (oxbow) that was
formerly part of a channel.
Permeability The ability of a rock, sediment, or soil to allow pore fl uids and gases to pass
through it.
Pile The relatively long, slender column-like type of foundation that obtain supporting
capacity from the soil or rock some distance below the ground surface.
Plate tectonics A theory arising from a series of ideas developed in the early 1960s proposing
that the surface of the earth is composed of relatively thin plates of rigid materials. These
tectonic plates extend down to the low-velocity zone of upper mantle. They are all in motion
relative to one another and it is through these movements and the consequent collisions between
the plates that the present distribution of almost all volcanic, seismic, and orogenic activities
are controlled.
Poisson’s ratio The ratio of lateral unit strain to the longitudinal unit strain in a body that has
been stressed longitudinally within its elastic limit.
Pore pressure Water pressure developed in the voids of a soil mass. Excess pore pressure
refers to pressure greater than the normal hydraulic pressure expected as a result of position
bellow the water table.
Porosity The extent to which a body of soil, rock, or sediment is permeated with cavities
between grains, usually expressed as a percentage of volume. These pores are fi lled by air and
water, which impede air movement and allow water to move only by capillarity.
Pyroclastic rock A rock formed by accumulation of fragmented materials thrown out by
volcanic explosion. It may be associated with ash fl ow of exploded lava that became pulverized
as it came down a slope to form a deposit of fragmented rocks and dust.
Reverse fault A type of fault in which the movement along the inclined fault plane is towards
the up-dip. The rock on the down slip side of the fault has moved upwards.
Rip-rap The layer of boulders or crushed rocks typically ranging from 15 cm to 60 cm in
size, placed as a covering to protect the surface of an earth dam and earth slopes against erosion.
Seismic wave A wave generated by an explosion or earthquake within the earth or on its
surface. There are four main types of seismic waves, namely primary wave, secondary wave,
Rayleigh wave, and love wave.
Seismogram The oscillating line record of ground movements measured by a seismograph
during an earthquake.
Seismograph An instrument to measure the horizontal and vertical movements or vibrations
that occur within the earth or at the surface because of an earthquake or other seismic waves.
Shear strength The ability of a soil to resist shearing stresses within a soil mass as a result
of loading imposed on the soil.
Appendix C.indd 548 10/18/2012 12:37:42 PM
Glossary ● 549
Sill A near-horizontal sheet-like igneous intrusion, usually dolerite, of roughly uniform
thickness but thin relative to its area.
Slickenside Small parallel grooves or striations formed on the surface of a fault as result of
movement of rocks against each other. The surface is smooth in one direction but rough in the
opposite direction.
Strike The direction along a rock stratum at right angle to the true dip.
Subduction The process describing one tectonic plate descending at an angle below another,
which happens at a destructive plate boundary.
Syncline A basin-shaped fold in which the beds dip towards each other.
Thrust A low-angle reverse fault that extends over a large distance pushing older rocks over
the younger rock.
Tide The regular rising and falling of water level in ocean from the gravitational attraction
that exists between the earth, the sun, and the moon. Depending upon their positions, either
spring tides or neap tides occur.
Tsunami A seismic sea wave generated in the ocean by submarine earthquake, volcanic
eruptions, or mass slides underwater. The height of the waves is low while travelling through
deep water but it gradually increases, and the waves become extremely dangerous as they
approach the shore.
Unconformity A surface representing a period of non-deposition or erosion separating rocks
of different age.
Vadose zone The subsurface soil zone that lies directly above the position of the groundwater
table. Usually, this zone is partially saturated with water that has migrated upward via capillary
movement from the water table.
Vein A more or less upright sheet deposit of minerals, cutting other rocks and formed from
solution rather than from a molten magma-like dyke.
Void ratio The total volume occupied by a soil mass includes the soil particles plus void
spaces. The void ration is the ratio of the void space volume to the volume of soil solids.
Volcano A fi ssure or vent on the earth’s surface connected by a conduit to the earth’s interior
from which lava, gas, and pyroclastic materials erupt.
Wave-cut platform An irregular gently sloping bare rock platform extending out to ocean
and usually backed by cliffs. It is the wearing of the cliff that causes the enlargement of the
platform. As this will not develop in areas where there is a covering of beach material, the most
favourable sites are headlands.
Weathering The process of slow decay of rock and its constituent minerals upon exposure to
the earth’s surface by either mechanical or chemical attack.
