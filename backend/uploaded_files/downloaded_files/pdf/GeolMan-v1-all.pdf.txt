Aclm.owledgmenu
tor Second Edition
The original compilation and p~paration of this manual
involved many engineering geologists and geophysicists
within Reclamation. Their input is greatly appreciated. This
second edition incorporates comments on the first edition
and technological changes since the first edition was
prepared appro:limately 10 years ago. Without the
comments and i.JJ.put from the Denver, Regional, and Area
Offices the revision would not have happened. Special
thanks to Sam Bartlett, Engineering Geology Group 1
Manager, for his support and input throughout the
preparation of the manual.
Although there are too many people to acknowledge
individually who contributed to the revisions and the second
edition, Frank Calcagno, Mel Hill (retired), Sandy Kunzer,
Jeff Farrar, SharoJ;l Hebenstreit, Linda Arrowwood, and
Peter Rohrer made especially significant contributions.
Mark McKeown contributed to and edited the second edition.
Continued recognition ili given to Jerry S. Dodd (retired),
who initiated the manual; Jeny's successor, Newcomb
Bennett (retired), who kept the manual moving; and to
Steve D. Markwell (retired), who saw the first edition
completed. We extend our thanks and appreciation to
Louis R. Frei, who helped establish and document many
geological standards of practice, and to Richard H. Throner,
who wrote much of the original manual, who assembled and
served on committees for preparation and review, to Sam R.
Bartlett who compiled and printed the early loose leaf
ven:~ion of the manual, and to Mel Hill who completed the
publication of the first edition. To the ~gion-al Geologists
and their staffs and the many geotechnical engineers who
offered comments that have been mcorporated into the
manual we extend our thanks and appreciation for their
work as well. The manual would not be oeomplete with-out
the drawings and figures; to the engineering and physical
science technicians we extend our gratitude and thanks.

FOREWORD
TO THE SECOND EDITION
Approximately 10 years have gone by since the first
edition was published, and technolOgy and missions have
changed significantly. This second edition incorporates
many modifications and additions. The Global
Positioning System (GPS) baa revolutionized how we
survey and locate OU1'8elves in the field, computers are
used extensively ta collect and evaluate data, and
computer aided modeling, design, and drafting are almost
universal. Reclamation has a greater emphasis on
maintenance and safety of infrastnicture, dam safety
analyses and modifications, and water resource
management than on design and construction of new
hydraulic structures. Techniques for these activities and
environmental restoration/hazardous waste remediation
activities are reflected ill' this edition.
A few of the moat significant changes to the manual are
the addition of a section on concrete core logging, a
chapter on hazardous waste site investigations, and an
index to facilitate finding relevant information. Many
other suggested revisions and improvements collected
since the manual was first published also are
incorporated. The manum now is in two uolumes.
Volume I contains material commonly needed in the
field, and Volume II includes reference or other material.
As in the first edition, the Engineering Geolcgy Fkld
Manual presents the practices for the collection of
geologic data obtained by the Burcnu of Reclamation.
The manual establishes common guidelines, procedures,
and concepts for the collection, evaluation, and presen
tation of geologic i.¢onnation. The analyai.l! of geologic
conditions, the preparation ofd esigns and specifications,
and effective construction monitoring and use of geo
logical information to assess site characteri.l!tics and ri.l!k,
require consi.l!tent, comprehen8ive, and timely geologic
v
information. The use of these guidelines by all Recla
mation engineering geologists collecting, documenting,
evaluating, and presenting geological and geotechnical
data promotes consistency, helps assure that the requind
evaluations and data are complete, and promotes inte
gration and coordination of geological and engineering
activities.
The Engineering Geology Field Manual, in conjunction
with the Engineering Geology Office Manual, forms the
basis for the mutually beneficial exchange of ideas by
Reclamation geologists. Experienced geologists will find
useful reminders and new procedures and special tech
niques, while less experienced engineering geologists and
those from other disciplines can use the manual to
expand their familiarity with geology as practiced in the
Bureau of Reclamation.
Review and comments on the manual are encouraged,
and if you have comments ·or suggested additions, please
forward them to the Technical Service Center
Engineering Geology Groups.

INTRODUCTION
This manual provides guidelines and instructions for
performing and documenting field work. The manual is
a ready reference for anyone engaged in field-oriented
engineering geology or geotechnical engineering. The
manual is written for general engineering geology use as
well as to meet Reclamation needs. The application of
geology to solving engineering problems is emphasized,
rather than academic or other aspects of geology. The
manual provides guidance for:
• Geologic classification and description of rock and
rock discontinuities
• Engineering classification and description of soil
and surficial deposits
• Application of standard indexes, descriptors, and
terminology
• Geologic mapping, sampling, testing, and
performing discontinuity surveys
• Exploratory drilling
• Soil and rock logging
• Acquisition of groundwater data
• Core logging
• Soil logging
• Investigation of hazardous waste sites
FIELD MANUAL
Although the methods described in this manual are
appropriate for most situations, complex sites, conditions,
or design needs may require modification or expansion of
the suggestions, criteria, and indices to fit specific
requirements.
Many of the chapters in this manual will always need
revision because they cover material that changes as
technology changes. Critical comments, especially sug-
gestions for improvement, are welcome from all users,
not just the Bureau of Reclamation.
The appendix contains abbreviations and acronyms
commonly used in engineering geology.

Chapter 2
GEOLOGIC TERMINOLOGY
AND CLASSIFICATIONS FOR
GEOLOGIC MATERIALS
Established References for Geological
Terminology
Adaptations or refinements of the Bureau of Reclamation
(Reclamation) standards presented in this and subse-
quent chapters may be established to meet specific design
requirements or site-specific geologic complexity when
justified.
The Glossary of Geology, Fourth Edition [1]1, published by
the American Geological Institute (AGI), 1997, is accepted
by Reclamation as the standard for definitions of geologic
words and terms except for the nomenclature, definitions,
or usage established in this chapter and chapters 3, 4,
and 5.
The North American Stratigraphic Code (NASC) [2] is the
accepted system for classifying and naming stratigraphic
units. However, Reclamation's engineering geology pro-
grams are focused primarily on the engineering prop-
erties of geologic units, not on the details of formal
stratigraphic classification. Stratigraphic names are not
always consistent within the literature, often change from
one locality to another, and do not necessarily convey
engineering properties or rock types. Use of stratigraphic
names in Reclamation documents normally will be
informal (lower case) (see NASC for discussion of formal
versus informal usage). Exceptions to informal usage are
for names previously used formally in the area in discus-
sions of geologic setting or regional geology. Normally,
1 Brackets refer to bibliography entries at end of each chapter.
FIELD MANUAL
the first use of formal names in a report should include a
reference to a geologic map or publication in which the
term is defined.
Geologic Classification of Materials
The following definitions of geologic materials more fully
satisfy general usage and supersede those in the Glossary
of Geology. These definitions are for geologic classifica-
tion of materials. They should not be confused with engi-
neering classifications of materials such as rock and soil
or rock and common excavation.
• Bedrock is a general term that includes any of the gen-
erally indurated or crystalline materials that make up the
Earth's crust. Individual stratigraphic units or units sig-
nificant to engineering geology within bedrock may in-
clude poorly or nonindurated materials such as beds,
lenses, or intercalations. These may be weak rock units
or interbeds consisting of clay, silt, and sand (such as the
generally soft and friable St. Peter Sandstone), or clay
beds and bentonite partings in siliceous shales of the
Morrison Formation.
•Surficial Deposits are the relatively younger materials
occurring at or near the Earth's surface overlying bed-
rock. They occur as two major classes: (1) transported
deposits generally derived from bedrock materials by
water, wind, ice, gravity, and man's intervention and
(2) residual deposits formed in place as a result of
weathering processes. Surficial deposits may be stratified
or unstratified such as soil profiles, basin fill, alluvial or
fluvial deposits, landslides, or talus. The material may be
partially indurated or cemented by silicates, oxides,
carbonates, or other chemicals (caliche or hardpan). This
term is often used interchangeably with the imprecisely
4
TERMINOLOGY
defined word “overburden.” “Overburden” is a mining
term meaning, among other things, material overlying a
useful material that has to be removed. “Surficial
deposit” is the preferred term.
In some localities, where the distinction between bedrock
and surficial deposits is not clear, even if assigned a
stratigraphic name, a uniform practice should be estab-
lished and documented and that definition followed for
the site or study.
Guidelines for the collection of data pertaining to bedrock
and surficial deposits are presented in chapter 6.
Engineering Classification of Geologic
Materials
General
Geologic classification of materials as surficial deposits or
bedrock is insufficient for engineering purposes. Usually,
surficial deposits are described as soil for engineering
purposes, and most bedrock is described as rock; however,
there are exceptions. Contract documents often classify
structure excavations as to their ease of excavation. Also,
classification systems for tunneling in geologic materials
have been established.
Classification as Soil or Rock
In engineering applications, soil may be defined as gener-
ally unindurated accumulations of solid particles
produced by the physical and/or chemical disintegration
of bedrock and which may or may not contain organic
matter. Surficial deposits, such as colluvium, alluvium,
or residual soil, normally are described using Recla-
5
FIELD MANUAL
mation Procedure 5005, Determining Unified Soil
Classification (Visual Method) [3]. American Society for
Testing and Materials (ASTM) Standards D2487-85,
Standard Test Method for Classification of Soils for
Engineering Purposes or D2488-84, Standard Practice for
Description and Identification of Soils (Visual-Manual
Procedure), which are based on Reclamation 5000 and
5005 [3] also may be used. Instructions for the
description and classification of soils are provided in
chapter 3. Chapter 11 provides instructions for the
logging of soils in geologic explorations. In some cases,
partially indurated soils may have rock-like
characteristics and may be described as rock.
The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)
Agricultural Soils Classification System is used for drain-
age and land classification and some detailed Quaternary
geology studies, such as for seismotectonic investigations.
Rock as an engineering material is defined as lithified or
indurated crystalline or noncrystalline materials. Rock
is encountered in masses and as large fragments which
have consequences to design and construction differing
from those of soil. Field classification of igneous,
metamorphic, sedimentary, and pyroclastic rocks are
provided in chapter 4. Chapter 4 also presents a
suggested description format, standard descriptors, and
descriptive criteria for the lithologic and engineering
physical properties of rock. Nonindurated materials with-
in bedrock should be described using the Reclamation soil
classification standards and soil descriptors presented in
chapter 3. Engineering and geological classification and
description of discontinuities which may be present in
either soil or rock are discussed in chapter 5.
6
TERMINOLOGY
Classification of Excavations
The engineering classification of excavation as either rock
excavation or common excavation or the definition of rock
in specifications must be evaluated and determined for
each contract document and should be based on the
physical properties of the materials (induration and other
characteristics), quantity and method of excavation, and
equipment constraints and size.
Classification of Materials for Tunneling
Classification systems are used for data reports, speci-
fications, and construction monitoring for tunnel designs
and construction. When appropriate for design, other
load prediction and classification systems may be used
such as the Q system developed by the Norwegian Geo-
technical Institute (NGI), Rock Mass Rating System
Geomechanics Classification (RMR), and Rock Structure
Rating (RSR).
The following terms for the classification of rock [4] for
tunneling are suggested:
• Intact rock contains neither joints nor hairline cracks.
If it breaks, it breaks across sound rock. On account of
damage to the rock due to blasting, spalls may drop off
the roof several hours or days after blasting. This is
known as spalling condition. Hard, intact rock may also
be encountered in the popping condition (rock burst)
involving the spontaneous and violent detachment of rock
slabs from sides or roof.
• Stratified rock consists of individual strata with little
or no resistance against separation along the boundaries
7
FIELD MANUAL
between strata. The strata may or may not be weakened
by transverse joints. In such rock, the spalling condition
is quite common.
• Moderately jointed rock contains joints and hairline
cracks, but the blocks between joints are locally grown
together or so intimately interlocked that vertical walls
do not require lateral support. In rocks of this type, both
the spalling and the popping condition may be
encountered.
• Blocky and seamy rock consists of chemically intact
or almost intact rock fragments which are entirely
separated from each other and imperfectly interlocked.
In such rock, vertical walls may require support.
• Crushed but chemically intact rock has the char-
acter of a crusher run. If most or all of the fragments are
as small as fine sand and no recementation has taken
place, crushed rock below the water table exhibits the
properties of a water-bearing sand.
• Squeezing rock slowly advances into the tunnel
without perceptible volume increase. Movement is the
result of overstressing and plastic failure of the rock mass
and not due to swelling.
• Swelling rock advances into the tunnel chiefly on ac-
count of expansion. The capacity to swell is generally
limited to those rocks which contain smectite, a
montmorillonite group of clay minerals, with a high
swelling capacity.
Although the terms are defined, no distinct boundaries
exist between rock categories. Wide variations in the
physical properties of rocks classified by these terms and
rock loading are often the case.
8
TERMINOLOGY
Table 2-1, Ground behavior for earth tunneling with steel
supports, provides ground classifications for different
reactions of ground to tunneling operations.
Application and Use of Standard Indexes,
Terminology, and Descriptors
This section and subsequent chapters 3, 4, and 5 provide
definitions and standard descriptors for physical
properties of geologic materials which are of engineering
significance. The ability of a foundation to support loads
imposed by various structures depends primarily on the
deformability and stability of the foundation materials
and the groundwater conditions. Description of geologic
and some manmade materials (embankments) is one of
the geologist's direct contributions to the design process.
Judgment and intuition alone are not adequate for the
safe and economical design of large complex engineering
projects. Preparation of geologic logs, maps and sections,
and detailed descriptions of observed material is the least
expensive aspect and most continuous record of a sub-
surface exploration program. It is imperative to develop
design data properly because recent advances in soil and
rock mechanics have enabled engineers and geologists to
analyze more conditions than previously possible. These
analyses rely on physical models that are developed
through geologic observation and which must be
described without ambiguity.
The need for standard geologic terminology, indexes, and
descriptors has long been recognized because it is
important that design engineers and contractors, as
well as geologists, be able to have all the facts and quali-
tative information as a common basis to arrive at
conclusions from any log of exploration, report, or draw-
ing, regardless of the preparer. Geologic terminology,

steel supports (after Terzaghi, 1977) [4]
Ground classification Reaction of ground to tunneling operation
HARD Tunnel heading may be advanced without roof support.
FIRM Ground in which a roof section of a tunnel can be left
unsupported for several days without inducing a
perceptible movement of the ground.
RAVELING Chunks or flakes of soil begin to drop out of roof at some
point during the ground-movement period.
SLOW RAVELING The time required to excavate 5 feet of tunnel and
install a rib set and lagging in a small tunnel is about
6 hours. Therefore, if the stand-up time of raveling
ground is more than 6 hours, by using ribs and lagging,
the steel rib sets may be spaced on 5-foot centers. Such
a soil would be classed as slow raveling.
FAST RAVELING If the stand-up time is less than 6 hours, set spacing
must be reduced to 4 feet, 3 feet, or even 2 feet. If the
stand-up time is too short for these smaller spacings,
liner plates should be used, either with or without rib
sets, depending on the tunnel size.
SQUEEZING Ground slowly advances into tunnel without any signs
of fracturing. The loss of ground caused by squeeze and
the resulting settlement of the ground surface can be
substantial.
SWELLING Ground slowly advances into the tunnel partly or chiefly
because of an increase in the volume of the ground. The
volume increase is in response to an increase of water
content. In every other respect, swelling ground in a
tunnel behaves like a stiff non-squeezing, or slowly
squeezing, non-swelling clay.
RUNNING The removal of lateral support on any surface rising at
an angle of more than 34E (to the horizontal) is
immediately followed by a running movement of the soil
particles. This movement does not stop until the slope
of the moving soil becomes roughly equal to 34E• if
running ground has a trace of cohesion, then the run is
preceded by a brief period of progressive raveling.
VERY SOFT SQUEEZINGGround advances rapidly into tunnel in a plastic flow.
FLOWING Ground supporting a tunnel cannot be classified as
flowing ground unless water flows or seeps through it
toward the tunnel. For this reason, a flowing condition
is encountered only in free air tunnels below the
watertable or under compressed air when the pressure
is not high enough in the tunnel to dry the bottom. A
second prerequisite for flowing is low cohesion of soil.
Therefore, conditions for flowing ground occur only in
inorganic silt, fine silty sand, clean sand or gravel, or
sand-and-gravel with some clay binder. Organic silt
may behave either as a flowing or as a very soft,
squeezing ground.

TERMINOLOGY
standard descriptors, and descriptive criteria for physical
properties have been established so that geologic data are
recorded uniformly, objectively, consistently, and accu-
rately. The application of these indexes, terminology,
descriptors, and various manual and visual tests must be
applied consistently by all geologists for each particular
project. The need to calibrate themselves with others per-
forming similar tests and descriptions is imperative to
ensure that data are recorded and interpreted uniformly.
The use of these standard descriptors and terminology is
not intended to replace the geologist's or engineer's indi-
vidual judgment. The established standard qualitative
and quantitative descriptors will assist newly employed
geologists and engineers in understanding Reclamation
terminology and procedures, permit better analysis of
data, and permit better understanding by other geologists
and engineers, and by contractors. Most of the physical
dimensions established for the descriptive criteria per-
taining to rock and discontinuity characteristics have
been established using a 1-3-10-30-100 progression for
consistency, ease of memory, conversion from English to
metric (30 millimeters [mm] = 0.1 foot [ft]) units, and to
conform to many established standards used throughout
the world. Their use will improve analysis, design and
construction considerations, and specifications prepara-
tion. Contractor claims also should be reduced due to
consistent and well defined terminology and descriptors.
Alphanumeric values for many physical properties have
been established to enable the geotechnical engineer and
engineering geologist to readily analyze the geologic data.
These alphanumeric descriptors also will assist in compi-
lation of data bases and computer searches when using
computer generated logs. For consistency, the lower the
alphanumeric value, the more favorable the condition
being described. However, alphanumeric codes do not
replace a complete description of what is observed. A
11
FIELD MANUAL
complete description provides physical dimensions
including a range and/or average in size, width, length or
other physical property, and/or descriptive information.
It is important to start physical testing of the geologic
materials as early as possible in an exploration program;
descriptors alone are not sufficient. As data are inter-
preted, index properties tests can be performed in the
field to obtain preliminary strength estimates for repre-
sentative materials or materials requiring special con-
sideration. The scope of such a program must be tailored
to each feature. Tests which are to be considered include
point load, Schmidt hammer, sliding tilt, and pocket
Torvane or penetrometer tests. These tests are described
briefly in chapters 4 and 5. Indexes to be considered
include rock hardness, durability (slaking), and Rock
Quality Designation (RQD). The type of detailed labora-
tory studies can be formulated better and the amount of
sampling and testing may be reduced if results from field
tests are available.
Units of Measurements for Geologic Logs of
Exploration, Drawings, and Reports
Metric Units
For metric specifications and studies, metric (Interna-
tional System of Units) should be used from the start of
work if possible. Logs of exploration providing depth
measurements should be given to tenths or hundredths of
meters. All linear measurements such as particle or
crystal sizes, ranges or averages in thickness, openness,
and spacing, provided in descriptor definitions in
chapters 3, 4, and 5, should be expressed in millimeters
or meters as appropriate. Pressures should be given in
pascals (Pa). Permeability (hydraulic conductivity)
12
TERMINOLOGY
should be in centimeters per second (cm/s). In some
cases, local usage of other units such as kilogram per
square centimeter (kg/cm2) for pressure or centimeters
(cm) may be used.
English Units (U.S. Customary)
For specifications and studies using United States cus-
tomary or English units (inch-pound), depth measure-
ments should be given in feet and tenths of feet. Ranges
in thickness, openness, and spacing, are preferred in
tenths or hundredths of a foot, or feet as shown in the
descriptor definitions in chapters 4 and 5. Pressure
should be in pound-force per square inch (lbf/in2 or
PSI). Permeability should be in feet per year (ft/yr). The
exceptions to the use of English units (inch-pound) are for
describing particle and grain sizes and age dating.
Particle sizes for soils classified using American Society
for Testing and Materials/Unified Soil Classification
Systems (ASTM/USCS) should be in metric units on all
logs of exploration. For description of bedrock, particle
and grain sizes are to be in millimeters.
Age Dates
If age dates are abbreviated, the North American Strati-
graphic Commission (NASC) recommends ka for thousand
years and Ma for million years, but my or m.y. (million
years) for time intervals (for example, ". . . during a
period of 40 my . . .").

ENGINEERING CLASSIFICATION
AND DESCRIPTION OF SOIL
General
Application
Soil investigations conducted for engineering purposes
that use test pits, trenches, auger and drill holes, or other
exploratory methods and surface sampling and mapping
are logged and described according to the Unified Soil
Classification System (USCS) as presented in Bureau of
Reclamation (Reclamation) standards USBR 5000 [1] and
5005 [2]. Also, bedrock materials with the engineering
properties of soils are described using these standards
(chapter 2). The Reclamation standards are consistent
with the American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM)
Designation D2487 and 2488 on the USCS system [3,4].
Descriptive criteria and terminology presented are
primarily for the visual classification and manual tests.
The identification portion of these methods in assigning
group symbols is limited to soil particles smaller than
3 inches (in) (75 millimeters [mm]) and to naturally
occurring soils. Provisions are also made to estimate the
percentages of cobbles and boulders by volume. This
descriptive system may also be applied to shale, shells,
crushed rock, and other materials if done according to
criteria established in this section. Chapter 11 addresses
the logging format and criteria for describing soil in test
pits, trenches, auger holes, and drill hole logs.
All investigations associated with land classification for
irrigation suitability, data collection, analyses of soil
and substratum materials related to drainage inves-
tigations, and Quaternary stratigraphy (e.g., fault and
paleoflood studies) are logged and described using the
FIELD MANUAL
U.S. Department of Agriculture terminology outlined in
appendix I to Agriculture Handbook No. 436 (Soil
Taxonomy), dated December 1975 [5].
All soil classification descriptions for particle sizes less
than No. 4 sieve size are to be in metric units.
Performing Tests and Obtaining Descriptive
Information
The USCS groups soils according to potential engineering
behavior. The descriptive information assists with esti-
mating engineering properties such as shear strength,
compressibility, and permeability. These guidelines can
be used not only for identification of soils in the field but
also in the office, laboratory, or wherever soil samples are
inspected and described.
Laboratory classification of soils [1] is not always
required but should be performed as necessary and can be
used as a check of visual-manual methods. The descrip-
tors obtained from visual-manual inspection provide
valuable information not obtainable from laboratory
testing. Visual-manual inspection is always required.
The visual-manual method has particular value in
identifying and grouping similar soil samples so that only
a minimum number of laboratory tests are required for
positive soil classification. The ability to identify and
describe soils correctly is learned more readily under the
guidance of experienced personnel, but can be acquired by
comparing laboratory test results for typical soils of each
type with their visual and manual characteristics. When
identifying and describing soil samples from an area or
project, all the procedures need not be followed. Similar
soils may be grouped together; for example, one sample
should be identified and described completely, with the
others identified as similar based on performing only a
few of the identification and descriptive procedures.
18
SOIL
Descriptive information should be evaluated and reported
on every sample.
The sample used for classification must be representative
of the stratum and be obtained by an appropriate ac-
cepted or standard procedure. The origin of the material
must be correctly identified. The origin description may
be a boring number and depth and/or sample number, a
geologic stratum, a pedologic horizon, or a location
description with respect to a permanent monument, a
grid system, or a station number and offset.
Terminology for Soils
Definitions for soil classification and description are in
accordance with USBR 3900 Standard Definitions of
Terms and Symbols Relating to Soil Mechanics [6]:
Cobbles and boulders—particles retained on a 3-inch
(75-mm) U.S. Standard sieve. The following terminology
distinguishes between cobbles and boulders:
• Cobbles—particles of rock that will pass a 12-in
(300-mm) square opening and be retained on a 3-in
(75-mm) sieve.
• Boulders—particles of rock that will not pass a
12-in (300-mm) square opening.
Gravel—particles of rock that will pass a 3-in (75-mm)
sieve and is retained on a No. 4 (4.75-mm) sieve. Gravel
is further subdivided as follows:
• Coarse gravel—passes a 3-in (75-mm) sieve and is
retained on 3/4-in (19-mm) sieve.
• Fine gravel—passes a ¾-in (19-mm) sieve and is
retained on No. 4 (4.75-mm) sieve.
19
FIELD MANUAL
Sand—particles of rock that will pass a No. 4 (4.75-mm)
sieve and is retained on a No. 200 (0.075-mm or 75-micro-
meter [µm]) sieve. Sand is further subdivided as follows:
• Coarse sand—passes No. 4 (4.75-mm) sieve and is
retained on No. 10 (2.00-mm) sieve.
• Medium sand—passes No. 10 (2.00-mm) sieve and
is retained on No. 40 (425-µm) sieve.
• Fine sand—passes No. 40 (425-µm) sieve and is
retained on No. 200 (0.075-mm or 75-µm) sieve.
Clay—passes a No. 200 (0.075-mm or 75-µm) sieve. Soil
has plasticity within a range of water contents and has
considerable strength when air-dry. For classification,
clay is a fine-grained soil, or the fine-grained portion of a
soil, with a plasticity index greater than 4 and the plot of
plasticity index versus liquid limit falls on or above the
"A"-line (figure 3-5, later in this chapter).
Silt—passes a No. 200 (0.075-mm or 75-µm) sieve. Soil
is nonplastic or very slightly plastic and that exhibits
little or no strength when air-dry is a silt. For
classification, a silt is a fine-grained soil, or the fine-
grained portion of a soil, with a plasticity index less than
4 or the plot of plasticity index versus liquid limit falls
below the "A"-line (figure 3-5).
Organic clay—clay with sufficient organic content to in-
fluence the soil properties is an organic clay. For classifi-
cation, an organic clay is a soil that would be classified as
a clay except that its liquid limit value after oven-drying
is less than 75 percent of its liquid limit value before
oven-drying.
20
SOIL
Organic silt—silt with sufficient organic content to in-
flu-ence the soil properties. For classification, an organic
silt is a soil that would be classified as a silt except that
its liquid limit value after oven-drying is less than
75 percent of its liquid limit value before oven-drying.
Peat—material composed primarily of vegetable tissues
in various stages of decomposition, usually with an or-
ganic odor, a dark brown to black color, a spongy con-
sistency, and a texture ranging from fibrous to amor-
phous. Classification procedures are not applied to peat.
Classifications of Soils
Group Names and Group Symbols
The identification and naming of a soil based on results
of visual and manual tests is presented in a subsequent
section. Soil is given an identification by assigning a
group symbol(s) and group name. Important information
about the soil is added to the group name by the term
"with" when appropriate (figures 3-1, 3-2, 3-3, 3-4). The
group name is modified using “with” to stress other
significant components in the soil.
Figure 3-2 is a flow chart for assigning typical names and
group symbols for inorganic fine-grained soils; figure 3-3
is a flow chart for organic fine-grained soils; figure 3-4 is
a flow chart for coarse-grained soils. Refer to tables 3-1
and 3-2 for the basic group names without modifiers. If
the soil has properties which do not distinctly place it in

a specific group, borderline symbols may be used. There
is a distinction between dual symbols and borderline
symbols.
Dual Symbols.—Dual symbols separated by a hyphen
are used in laboratory classification of soils and in visual
classification when soils are estimated to contain
10 percent fines. A dual symbol (two symbols separated
by a hyphen, e.g., GP-GM, SW-SC, CL-ML) should be
used to indicate that the soil has the properties of a
classification where two symbols are required. Dual sym-
bols are required when the soil has between 5 and
12 percent fines from laboratory tests (table 3-2), or fines
are estimated as 10 percent by visual classification. Dual
symbols are also required when the liquid limit and
plasticity index values plot in the CL-ML area of the
plasticity chart (figure 3-5, later in this chapter).

SOIL
Borderline Symbols.—Borderline symbols are used
when soil properties indicate the soil is close to another
classification group. Two symbols separated by a slash,
such as CL/CH, SC/CL, GM/SM, CL/ML, should be used
to indicate that the soil has properties that do not
distinctly place the soil into a specific group. Because the
visual classification of soil is based on estimates of
particle-size distribution and plasticity characteristics, it
may be difficult to clearly identify the soil as belonging to
one category. To indicate that the soil may fall into one
of two possible basic groups, a borderline symbol may be
used with the two symbols separated by a slash. A
borderline classification symbol should not be used
indiscriminately. Every effort should be made first to
place the soil into a single group. Borderline symbols can
also be used in laboratory classification, but less
frequently.
A borderline symbol may be used when the percentage of
fines is visually estimated to be between 45 and 55 per-
cent. One symbol should be for a coarse-grained soil with
fines and the other for a fine-grained soil. For example:
GM/ML, CL/SC.
A borderline symbol may be used when the percentage of
sand and the percentage of gravel is estimated to be
about the same, for example, GP/SP, SC/GC, GM/SM. It
is practically impossible to have a soil that would have a
borderline symbol of GW/SW. However, a borderline
symbol may be used when the soil could be either well
graded or poorly graded. For example: GW/GP, SW/SP.
A borderline symbol may be used when the soil could be
either a silt or a clay. For example: CL/ML, CH/MH,
SC/SM.
27
FIELD MANUAL
A borderline symbol may be used when a fine-grained soil
has properties at the boundary between a soil of low com-
pressibility and a soil of high compressibility. For
example: CL/CH, MH/ML.
The order of the borderline symbol should reflect simi-
larity to surrounding or adjacent soils. For example, soils
in a borrow area have been predominantly identified as
CH. One sample has the borderline symbol of CL and
CH. To show similarity to the adjacent CH soils, the
borderline symbol should be CH/CL.
The group name for a soil with a borderline symbol
should be the group name for the first symbol, except for:
CL/CH - lean to fat clay
ML/CL - clayey silt
CL/ML - silty clay
Preparation for Identification and Visual
Classification
A usually dark-brown to black material composed
primarily of vegetable tissue in various stages of decom-
position with a fibrous to amorphous texture and organic
odor is a highly organic soil and classified as peat, PT.
Plant forms may or may not be readily recognized. In
general, the greater the organic content, the greater the
water content, void ratio, and compressibility of peat.
Organic soils are often identified by their odor. To check
for organic content, the soil can be subjected to the
laboratory classification liquid limit test criteria. Organic
soils can also be identified through laboratory loss-on-
ignition tests. Materials identified as peat are not sub-
jected to the following identification procedures.
28
SOIL
Soil identification procedures are based on the minus 3-in
(75-mm) particle sizes. All plus 3-in (75-mm) particles
must be manually removed from a loose sample, or
mentally for an intact sample, before classifying the soil.
Estimate and note the percent by volume of the plus 3-in
(75-mm) particles, both the percentage of cobbles and the
percentage of boulders.
Note: Because the percentages of the particle-
size distribution in laboratory classification
(ASTM: D 2487) are by dry weight and the
estimates of percentages for gravel, sand, and
fines are by dry weight, the description should
state that the percentages of cobbles and
boulders are by volume, not weight, for visual
classification. Estimation of the volume of cob-
bles and boulders is not an easy task. Accurate
estimating requires experience. While exper-
ienced loggers may be able to successfully
estimate the minus 3-in fraction to within
5 percent, the margin of error could be larger for
oversize particles. Estimates can be confirmed
or calibrated with large scale field gradation
tests on critical projects. Given the large pos-
sible errors in these estimates, the estimates
should not be used as the sole basis for design of
processing equipment. Large scale gradations
should be obtained as part of the process plant
designs.
In most cases, the volume of oversize is estimated in
three size ranges, 3 to 5, 5 to 12, and 12 inches and
larger. Cobbles are often divided into two size ranges,
because in roller compacted fill of 6-in compacted lift
thickness, the maximum size cobble is 5 inches. If the
purpose of the investigation is not for roller compacted
fill, a single size range for cobbles can be estimated.
29
FIELD MANUAL
Estimate and note the percentage by dry weight of the
gravel, sand, and fines of the fraction of the soil smaller
than 3 in (75-mm). The percentages are estimated to the
closest 5 percent. The percentages of gravel, sand, and
fines must add up to 100 percent, excluding trace
amounts. The presence of a component not in sufficient
quantity to be considered 5 percent in the minus 3-in
(75-mm) portion, is indicated by the term "trace." For ex-
ample: trace of fines. A trace is not considered in the
total of 100 percent for the components.
The first step in the identification procedure is to
determine the percentages of fine-grained and coarse-
grained materials in the sample. The soil is fine-grained
if it contains 50 percent or more fines. The soil is coarse-
grained if it contains less than 50 percent fines.
Procedures for the description and classification of these
two preliminary identification groups follow.
Procedures and Criteria for Visual Classification
of Fine-Grained Soils
Select a representative sample of the material for
examination and remove particles larger than the
No. 40 sieve (medium sand and larger) until a specimen
equivalent to about a handful of representative material
is available. Use this specimen for performing the
identification tests.
Identification Criteria for Fine-Grained Soils.—The
tests for identifying properties of fines are dry strength,
dilatency, toughness, and plasticity.
1. Dry strength.—Select from the specimen enough
material to mold into a ball about 1 in (25 mm) in
diameter. Mold or work the material until it has the
consistency of putty, adding water if necessary.
30
SOIL
From the molded material, make at least three test
specimens. Each test specimen should be a ball of
material about ½ in (12 mm) in diameter. Allow the
test specimens to dry in air or sun, or dry by artificial
means, as long as the temperature does not exceed
60 degrees Centigrade (EC). In most cases, it will be
necessary to prepare specimens and allow them to
dry over night. If the test specimen contains natural
dry lumps, those that are about ½ in (12 mm) in
diameter may be used in place of molded balls. (The
process of molding and drying usually produces
higher strengths than are found in natural dry lumps
of soil). Test the strength of the dry balls or lumps by
crushing them between the fingers and note the
strength as none, low, medium, high, or very high
according to the criteria in table 3-3. If natural dry
lumps are used, do not use the results of any of the
lumps that are found to contain particles of coarse
sand.
Table 3-3.—Criteria for describing dry strength
None The dry specimen crumbles with mere
pressure of handling.
Low The dry specimen crumbles with some
finger pressure.
Medium The dry specimen breaks into pieces or
crumbles with considerable finger
pressure.
High The dry specimen cannot be broken with
finger pressure. Specimen will break into
pieces between thumb and a hard surface.
Very High The dry specimen cannot be broken
between thumb and a hard surface.
31
FIELD MANUAL
The presence of high-strength, water-soluble cement-
ing materials, such as calcium carbonate, may cause
exceptionally high dry strengths. The presence of
calcium carbonate can usually be detected from the
intensity of the reaction with dilute hydrocloric acid
(HCl). Criteria for reaction with HCl are presented
in a subsequent paragraph.
2. Dilatancy.—Select enough material from the
specimen to mold into a ball about ½ in (12 mm) in
diameter. Mold the material, adding water if neces-
sary, until it has a soft, but not sticky, consistency.
Smooth the soil ball in the palm of one hand with the
blade of a knife or spatula. Shake horizontally (the
soil ball), striking the side of the hand vigorously
against the other hand several times. Note the
reaction of the water appearing on the surface of the
soil. Squeeze the sample by closing the hand or
pinching the soil between the fingers and note
reaction as none, slow, or rapid according to the
criteria in table 3-4. The reaction criteria are the
speeds with which water appears while shaking and
disappears while squeezing.
Table 3-4.—Criteria for describing dilatancy
None No visible change in the specimen.
Slow Water slowly appears on the surface of the
specimen during shaking and does not disap-
pear or disappears slowly upon squeezing.
Rapid Water quickly appears on the surface of the
specimen during shaking and disappears
upon squeezing.

3. Toughness.—Following completion of the
dilatancy test, the specimen is shaped into an
elongated pat and rolled by hand on a smooth surface
or between the palms into a thread about c in
(3 mm) diameter. (If the sample is too wet to roll
easily, spread the sample out into a thin layer and
allow some water loss by evaporation). Fold the
sample threads and reroll repeatedly until the thread
crumbles at a diameter of about c in (3 mm) when
the soil is near the plastic limit. Note the time
required to reroll the thread to reach the plastic
limit. Note the pressure required to roll the thread
near the plastic limit. Also, note the strength of the
thread. After the thread crumbles, the pieces should
be lumped together and kneaded until the lump
crumbles. Note the toughness of the material during
kneading.
Describe the toughness of the thread and lump as
low, medium, or high according to the criteria in
table 3-5.
Table 3-5.—Criteria for describing toughness
Low Only slight pressure is required to roll the
thread near the plastic limit. The thread
and the lump are weak and soft.
Medium Medium pressure is required to roll the
thread to near the plastic limit. The thread
and the lump have medium stiffness.
High Considerable pressure is required to roll the
thread to near the plastic limit. The thread
and the lump have very high stiffness.
33
FIELD MANUAL
4. Plasticity.—On the basis of observations made
during the toughness test, describe the plasticity of
the material according to the criteria given in
table 3-6 (figure 3-5).
Table 3-6.—Criteria for describing plasticity
Nonplastic A 3-mm thread cannot be rolled at any
water content.
Low The thread can barely be rolled, and the
lump cannot be formed when drier than
the plastic limit.
Medium The thread is easy to roll, and not much
time is required to reach the plastic limit.
The thread cannot be rerolled after
reaching the plastic limit. The lump
crumbles when drier than the plastic
limit.
High It takes considerable time rolling and
kneading to reach the plastic limit. The
thread can be rolled several times after
reaching the plastic limit. The lump can
be formed without crumbling when drier
than the plastic limit.
After the dry strength, dilatency, toughness, and
plasticity tests have been performed, decide on
whether the soil is an organic or an inorganic fine-
grained soil.

FIELD MANUAL
Identification of Inorganic Fine-Grained Soils.—
Classify the soils using the results of the manual tests
and the identifying criteria shown in table 3-7. Possible
inorganic soils include lean clay (CL), fat clay (CH), silt
(ML), and elastic silt (MH). The properties of an elastic
silt are similar to those for a lean clay. However, the silt
will dry quickly on the hand and have a smooth, silky feel
when dry. Some soils which classify as MH according to
the field classification criteria are difficult to distinguish
from lean clays, CL. It may be necessary to perform
laboratory testing to ensure proper classification.
Table 3-7.—Identification of inorganic fine-grained
soils from manual tests
Group Dry
symbol strength Dilatancy Toughness
ML None to low Slow to Low or thread

CL Medium to high None to slow Medium
MH Low to medium None to slow Low to medium
CH High to very None High
high
Some soils undergo irreversible changes upon air drying.
These irreversible processes may cause changes in
atterberg limits and other index tests. Even unsuspected
soils such as low plasticity silts may have differing
atterberg limits due to processes like disaggregation.
When tested at natural moisture, clay particles cling to
silt particles resulting in less plasticity. When dried, the
clay disaggregates, making a finer and more well graded
mix of particles with increased plasticity.
36
SOIL
For foundation studies of existing or new structures,
natural moisture atterberg limits are preferred because
the in-place material will remain moist. Natural mois-
ture atterberg limits are especially important in critical
studies, such as earthquake liquefaction evaluation of
silts. On some foundation studies, such as for pumping
plant design, consolidation tests will govern, and natural
moisture atterbergs are not required. For borrow studies,
soils will likely undergo moisture changes, and natural
moisture atterberg limits are not required unless unusual
mineralogy is encountered.
Identification of Organic Fine-Grained Soils.—If the
soil contains enough organic particles to influence the soil
properties, classify the soil as an organic soil, OL or OH.
Organic soils usually are dark brown to black and usually
have an organic odor. Often organic soils will change
color, (black to brown) when exposed to air. Organic soils
normally do not have high toughness or plasticity. The
thread for the toughness test is spongy. In some cases,
further identification of organic soils as organic silts or
organic clays, OL or OH is possible. Correlations between
the dilatancy, dry strength, and toughness tests with
laboratory tests can be made to classify organic soils in
similar materials.
Modifiers for Fine-Grained Soil Classifications.—If
based on visual observation, the soil is estimated to have
15 to 25 percent sand and/or gravel, the words "with sand
and/or gravel" are added to the group name, for example,
LEAN CLAY WITH SAND, (CL); SILT WITH SAND AND
GRAVEL (ML). Refer to figures 3-2 and 3-3. If the soil is
visually estimated to be 30 percent or more sand and/or
gravel, the words "sandy" or "gravelly" are added to the
group name. Add the word "sandy" if there appears to be
more sand than gravel. Add the word "gravelly" if there
appears to be more gravel than sand, for example,
SANDY LEAN CLAY (CL); GRAVELLY FAT CLAY (CH);
37
FIELD MANUAL
SANDY SILT (ML). Refer to figures 3-2 and 3-3. Note
that the Laboratory Classification follows different
criteria.
Procedures and Criteria for Visual Classification
of Coarse-Grained Soils
A representative sample containing less than 50 percent
fines is identified as a coarse-grained soil.
The soil is a gravel if the percentage by weight of gravel
is estimated to be more than the percentage of sand.
The soil is a sand if the percentage by weight of sand is
estimated to be more than the percentage of gravel.
The soil is a clean gravel or clean sand if the percentages
of fines are visually estimated to be 5 percent or less. A
clean gravel or sand is further classified by grain size
distribution.
The soil is classified as a WELL GRADED GRAVEL
(GW), or as a WELL GRADED SAND (SW), if a wide
range of particle sizes and substantial amounts of the
intermediate particle sizes are present. The soil is
classified as a POORLY GRADED GRAVEL (GP) or as a
POORLY GRADED SAND (SP) if the material is
predominantly one size (uniformly graded) or the soil has
a wide range of sizes with some intermediate sizes
obviously missing (gap or skip graded).
The soil is identified as either gravel with fines or sand
with fines if the percentage of fines is visually estimated
to be 15 percent or more.
38
SOIL
Classify the soil as a CLAYEY GRAVEL (GC) or a
CLAYEY SAND (SC) if the fines are clayey as determined
by the procedures for fine-grained soil identification.
Identify the soil as a SILTY GRAVEL (GM) or a SILTY
SAND (SM) if the fines are silty as determined by the pro-
cedures for fine-grained soil identification.
If the soil is visually estimated to contain 10 percent
fines, give the soil a dual classification using two group
symbols. The first group symbol should correspond to a
clean gravel or sand (GW, GP, SW, SP), and the second
symbol should correspond to a gravel or sand with fines
(GC, GM, SC, SM). The typical name is the first group
symbol plus "with clay" or "with silt" to indicate the
plasticity characteristics of the fines. For example,
WELL GRADED GRAVEL WITH CLAY (GW-GC);
POORLY GRADED SAND WITH SILT (SP-SM). Refer to
figure 3-4.
If the specimen is predominantly sand or gravel but con-
tains an estimated 15 percent or more of the other
coarse-grained constituent, the words "with gravel" or
"with sand" are added to the group name. For example:
POORLY GRADED GRAVEL WITH SAND (GP); CLAY-
EY SAND WITH GRAVEL (SC). Refer to figure 3-4.
If the field sample contained any cobbles and/or boulders,
the words "with cobbles" or "with cobbles and boulders"
are added to the group name, for example, SILTY GRA-
VEL WITH COBBLES (GM).
Abbreviated Soil Classification Symbols
If space is limited, an abbreviated system may be used to
indicate the soil classification symbol and name such as
in logs, data bases, tables, etc. The abbreviated system
39
FIELD MANUAL
is not a substitute for the full name and descriptive infor-
mation but can be used in supplementary presentations.
The abbreviated system consists of the soil classification
system based on this chapter, with prefixes and suffixes
as listed below.
Prefix: s = sandy g = gravelly
Suffix: s = with sand g = with gravel
c = with cobbles b = with boulders
The soil classification symbol is enclosed in parentheses.
Examples are:
CL, sandy lean clay s(CL)

Description of the Physical Properties of Soil
Descriptive information for classification and reporting
soil properties such as angularity, shape, color, moisture
conditions, and consistency are presented in the following
paragraphs.
Angularity
Angularity is a descriptor for coarse-grained materials
only. The angularity of the sand (coarse sizes only),
gravel, cobbles, and boulders, are described as angular,
40
SOIL
subangular, subrounded, or rounded as indicated by the
criteria in table 3-8. A range of angularity may be stated,
such as: sub-rounded to rounded.
Table 3-8.—Criteria for describing angularity of
coarse-grained particles
Angular Particles have sharp edges and relatively
planar sides with unpolished surfaces.
Subangular Particles are similar to angular description
but have rounded edges.
Subrounded Particles have nearly planar sides but well-
rounded corners and edges.
Rounded Particles have smoothly curved sides and no
edges.
Shape
Describe the shape of the gravel, cobbles, and boulders as
“flat, elongated” or “flat and elongated” if they meet the
criteria in table 3-9. Indicate the fraction of the particles
that have the shape, such as: one-third of gravel particles
are flat. If the material is to be processed or used as
aggregate for concrete, note any unusually shaped
particles.
Color
Color is an especially important property in identifying
organic soils and is often important in identifying other
types of soils. Within a given locality, color may also be
useful in identifying materials of similar geologic units.
Color should be described for moist samples. Note if color
41
FIELD MANUAL
Table 3-9.—Criteria for describing particle shape
The particle shape is described as follows, where length,
width, and thickness refer to the greatest, intermediate, and
least dimensions of a particle, respectively.
Flat Particles with width/thickness >3.
Elongated Particles with length/width >3.
Flat and Particles meet criteria for both flat and
elongated elongated.
represents a dry condition. If the sample contains layers
or patches of varying colors, this should be noted, and
representative colors should be described. The Munsel
Color System may be used for consistent color
descriptions.
Odor
Describe the odor if organic or unusual. Soils containing
a significant amount of organic material usually have
a distinctive odor of decaying vegetation. This is espe-
cially apparent in fresh samples, but if the samples are
dried, the odor often may be revived by heating a moist-
ened sample. If the odor is unusual, such as that of a
petroleum product or other chemical, the material should
be described and identified if known. The material may
be hazardous, and combustion or exposure should be
considered.
Moisture Conditions
Describe the moisture condition as dry, moist, or wet, as
indicated by the criteria in table 3-10.
42
SOIL
Table 3-10.—Criteria for describing moisture
condition
Dry Absence of moisture, dusty, dry to the touch.
Moist Damp but no visible water.
Wet Visible free water, usually soil is below water
table.
Reaction with HCl
Describe the reaction with HCl as none, weak, or strong,
as indicated by the criteria in table 3-11. Calcium
carbonate is a common cementing agent. The reaction
with dilute hydrochloric acid is important in determining
the presence and abundance of calcium carbonate.
Table 3-11.—Criteria for describing reaction with HCl
None No visible reaction.
Weak Some reaction, with bubbles forming slowly.
Strong Violent reaction, with bubbles forming immediately.
Consistency
Describe consistency (degree of firmness) for intact fine-
grained soils as very soft, soft, firm, hard, or very hard, as
indicated by the criteria in table 3-12. This observation
is inappropriate for soils with significant amounts of
gravel. Pocket penetrometer or torvane testing may sup-
plement this data.
43
FIELD MANUAL
Table 3-12.—Criteria for describing consistency of in-place or
undisturbed fine-grained soils
Very soft Thumb will penetrate soil more than 1 in
(25 mm).
Soft Thumb will penetrate soil about 1 in (25 mm).
Firm Thumb will indent soil about 1/4 in (5 mm).
Hard Thumb will not indent soil but readily indented
with thumbnail.
Very hard Thumbnail will not indent soil.
Cementation
Describe the cementation of intact soils as weak,
moderate, or strong, as indicated by the criteria in
table 3-13.
Table 3-13.—Criteria for describing cementation
Weak Crumbles or breaks with handling or little
finger pressure.
Moderate Crumbles or breaks with considerable finger
pressure.
Strong Will not crumble or break with finger pressure.
Structure (Fabric)
Describe the structure of the soil according to criteria
described in table 3-14. The descriptors presented are for
soils only; they are not synonymous with descriptors for
rock.
44
SOIL
Table 3-14.—Criteria for describing structure
Stratified Alternating layers of varying material or
color; note thicknesses.
Laminated1 Alternating layers of varying material or
color with layers less than 6 mm thick; note
thicknesses.
Fissured1 Breaks along definite planes with little
resistance to fracturing.
Slickensided1 Fracture planes appear polished or glossy,
sometimes striated.
Blocky1 Cohesive soil that can be broken down into
small angular lumps which resist further
breakdown.
Lenses Inclusion of small pockets of different soils,
such as small lenses of sand scattered
through a mass of clay; note thicknesses.
Homogeneous Same color and textural or structural
appearance throughout.
1 Do not use for coarse-grained soils with the exception of fine
sands which can be laminated.
Particle Sizes
For gravel and sand-size components, describe the range
of particle sizes within each component as defined in the
previous terminology paragraph. Descriptive terms,
sizes, and examples of particle sizes are shown in
table 3-15.

Describe the maximum particle size found in the sample.
For reporting maximum particle size, use the following
descriptors and size increments:
Fine sand
Medium sand
Coarse sand
5-mm increments from 5 mm to 75 mm
25-mm increments from 75 mm to 300 mm
100-mm increments over 300 mm
For example: "maximum particle size 35 mm"
"maximum particle size 400 mm"
If the maximum particle size is sand size, describe as
fine, medium, or coarse sand; for example, maximum par-
ticle size, medium sand.
46
SOIL
If the maximum particle size is gravel size, describe the
maximum particle size as the smallest sieve opening that
the particle would pass.
If the maximum particle size is cobble or boulder size,
describe the maximum dimension of the largest particle.
Particle Hardness
Describe the hardness of coarse sand and larger particles
as hard, or state what happens when the particles are hit
by a hammer; e.g., gravel-size particles fracture with
considerable hammer blow, some gravel-size particles
crumble with hammer blow. Hard means particles do not
fracture or crumble when struck with a hammer.
Remember that the larger the particle, the harder the
blow required to fracture it. A good practice is to describe
the particle size and the method that was used to
determine the hardness.
Additional Descriptive Information
Additional descriptive information may include unusual
conditions, geological interpretation or other classifi-
cation methods, such as:
Presence of roots or root holes or other organic
material or debris;
Degree of difficulty in drilling or augering hole or ex-
cavating a pit; or
Raveling or caving of the trench, hole, pit, or exposure;
or
Presence of mica or other predominant minerals.
A local or commercial name and/or a geologic interpreta-
tion should be provided for the soil.

Use of Soil Classification as Secondary
Identification Method for Materials Other
Than Natural Soils
General
Materials other than natural soils may be classified and
their properties identified and described using the same
procedures presented in the preceding subsections. The
following materials are not considered soils and should
not be given a primary USCS soil classification:
Partially lithified or poorly cemented materials
Shale Claystone
Sandstone Siltstone
Decomposed granite
Processed, manmade, or other materials
Crushed rock Slag
Crushed sandstone Shells
Cinders Ashes
51
FIELD MANUAL
Identification criteria may be used for describing these
materials, especially for describing particle sizes and
shapes and identifying those materials which convert to
soils after field or laboratory processing. Description for-
mat and classification for these materials are discussed
individually in the following paragraphs.
Partially Lithified or Cemented Materials
Partially lithified or poorly cemented materials may need
to be classified because the material will be excavated,
processed, or manipulated for use as a construction
material. When the physical properties are to be deter-
mined for these materials for classification, the material
must be processed into a soil by grinding or slaking in
water (shale, siltstone, poorly indurated ash deposits).
The physical properties and resulting classification
describe the soil type as created by reworking the original
material. Soil classifications can then be used as a
secondary identification. However, the classification
symbol and group name must be reported in quotation
marks in any 1ogs, tables, figures, and reports. If
laboratory tests are performed on these materials, the
results must be reported as shown in figure 3-6.
An example of a written narrative for either a test pit or
auger hole log based on visual classification is as follows:
Symbol Description
Shale Fragments 3.4- to 7.8-foot (ft) Shale Fragments—
Retrieved as 2- to 4-in pieces of shale
from power auger hole, dry, brown,

in water for 24 hours, material
classified as "SANDY CLAY (CH)"—

FIELD MANUAL
Approximately 60 percent fines with
high plasticity, high dry strength, no
dilatancy and high toughness;
approximately 35 percent fine to
medium, hard sand; approximately
5 percent gravel-size pieces of shale.
Processed or Manmade Materials
Processed, manmade, or other materials are also used as
construction materials, and classification can be used as
a secondary identification. However, for these processed
materials, the group name and classification symbol are
to be within quotation marks. If laboratory tests are
performed on these materials, the results must be
reported as shown in table 3-6.
An example of a written narrative for logs for visual clas-
sification is as follows:

bles from
P.T. NO. 7; "POORLY GRADED
GRAVEL (GP)"—approximately
90 percent fine, hard, angular,
gravel-size particles; approximately
10 percent coarse, angular, sand-
size particles; dry, tan, no reaction
with HCl.
Special Cases for Classification
Some materials that require a classification and descrip-
tion according to USBR 5000 [1] or USBR 5005 [2] should
not have a heading that is a classification group name.
54
SOIL
When these materials will be used in, or influence, design
and construction, they should be described according to
the criteria for logs of test pits and auger holes and the
classification symbol and typical name placed in quota-
tion marks similar to the previous discussion on second-
ary identification method for materials other than
natural soils. The heading should be as follows:
Topsoil
Landfill
Road surfacing Uncompacted or Compacted
Fill
For example:

Symbol Description
TOPSOIL 0.0-0.8 meter (m) TOPSOIL—would be
classified as "ORGANIC SILT (OL)."

plasticity, slow dilatancy, low dry
strength, and low toughness; approxi-
mately 20 percent fine to medium sand;
wet, dark brown, organic odor, weak reac-
tion with HCl; roots present throughout.
Some material should be described but not given a classi-
fication symbol or group name, such as landfill (trash,
garbage, etc.) or asphalt road. All of the above listed
terms are only examples; this is not a complete list. If the
above materials are not to be used and will not influence
design or construction, only the basic term listed above
need be shown on the logs without a complete description
or classification.

CLASSIFICATION OF ROCKS
AND DESCRIPTION OF PHYSICAL
PROPERTIES OF ROCK
Introduction
Uniformity of definitions, descriptors, and identification
of rock units is important to maintain continuity in
geologic logs, drawings, and reports from a project with
multiple drilling sessions, different loggers and mappers.
Also important is the recording of all significant observ-
able parameters when logging or mapping. This chapter
presents a system for the identification and classification
of rocks and includes standard terminology and
descriptive criteria for physical properties of engineering
significance. The standards presented in this chapter
may be expanded or modified to fit project requirements.
Rock Classification
Numerous systems are in use for field and petrographic
classification of rocks. Many classifications require
detailed petrographic laboratory tests and thin sections,
while others require limited petrographic examination
and field tests. The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation)
has adopted a classification system which is modified
from R.B. Travis [1]. While not based entirely on field
tests or field identification of minerals, many of the
classification categories are sufficiently broad that field
identification is possible. Even where differences in the
mineral constituents cannot be determined precisely in
the field, differences usually are not significant enough to
affect the engineering properties of the rock if classified
somewhat incorrectly by lithologic name. Detailed
mineralogical identification and petrographic
classification can be performed on hand samples or core
samples submitted to a petrographic laboratory.
FIELD MANUAL
If samples are submitted to a petrographic laboratory, the
petrographic classification generally will coincide with the
classification according to Travis. The petrographic
igneous rock classifications are somewhat more precise
and include specialty rock types based upon mineral com-
position, texture, and occurrence. For example, a
lamprophyric dike composed of green hornblende
phenocrysts or clinopyroxene in the groundmass could be
classified as spessartite, whereas a lamprophyre
containing biotite with or without clinopyroxene could be
classified as a kersantite. Sedimentary rock
classifications generally include grain size, type of cement
or matrix, mineral composition in order of increasing
amounts greater than 15 percent, and the rock type, such
as medium-grained, calcite-cemented, feldspathic-
quartzose sandstone, and coarse- to fine-grained, lithic-
feldspathic-quartzose gray-wacke with an argillaceous-
ferruginous-calcareous matrix. Metamorphic rock
classifications include specific rock types based upon
crystal size, diagnostic accessory minerals, mineralogical
composition in increasing amounts greater than
15 percent, and structure. Two examples of metamorphic
rock descriptions are medium-grained, hornblende-biotite
schist, or fine- to medium-grained, garnetiferous,
muscovite-chlorite-feldspar-quartz gneiss. The above
classification can be abbreviated by the deletion of
mineral names from the left to right as desired. The
mineral type immediately preceding the rock name is the
most diagnostic.
The term "quartzite” is restricted to a metamorphic rock
only. The sedimentary sandstone equivalent is termed a
"quartz cemented quartzose sandstone."
Samples submitted to a petrographic laboratory should be
representative of the in-place rock unit. For example, if
a granitic gneiss is sampled but only the granite portion
submitted, the rock will be petrographically classified as
58
ROCKS
a granite since the gneissic portion cannot be observed or
substantiated by the thin section and hand specimen.
Petrographic classifications can be related to the
engineering properties of rock units and are important.
Geologic rock unit names should be simple, and general
rock names should be based on either field identification,
existing literature, or detailed petrographic examination,
as well as engineering properties. Overclassification is
distracting and unnecessary. For example, use "horn-
blende schist" or "amphibolite" instead of "sericite-
chlorite-calcite-hornblende schist." The term "granite"
may be used as the rock name and conveys more to the
designer than the petrographically correct term
"nepheline-syenite porphyry." Detailed mineralogical
descriptions may be provided in reports when describing
the various rock units and may be required to correlate
between observations, but mineralogical classifications
are not desirable as a rock unit name unless the mineral
constituents or fabric are significant to engineering
properties.
The classification for igneous, sedimentary, metamorphic,
and pyroclastic rocks is shown on figures 4-1, 4-2, 4-3, and
4-4, respectively. These figures are condensed and
modified slightly from Travis' classifications, but the
more detailed original classifications of Travis are
acceptable. Figure 4-5 or appropriate American
Geological Institute (AGI) data sheets are suggested for
use when estimating composition percentages in
classification.

Engineering geology rock descriptions should include gen-
eralized lithologic and physical characteristics using
qualitative and quantitative descriptors. A general

• Rock unit (member or formation) name
• Lithology with lithologic descriptors
composition (mineralogy)
grain/particle size
texture
color
• Bedding/foliation/flow texture
• Weathering
• Hardness/strength
• Contacts
• Discontinuities (includes fracture indexes)
• Permeability data (as available from testing)
• Moisture conditions

FIELD MANUAL
Rock Unit Names and Identification
Rock unit names not only are required for identification
purposes but may also provide indicators of depositional
environment and geologic history, geotechnical char-
acteristics, and correlations with other areas. A simple
descriptive name and map symbol should be assigned to
provide other users with possible engineering
characteristics of the rock type. The rock unit names may
be stratigraphic, lithologic, genetic, or a combination of
these, such as Navajo Sandstone (Jn), Tertiary shale
(Tsh), Jurassic chlorite schist (Jcs), Precambrian granite
(Pcgr), or metasediments (ms). Bedrock units of similar
physical properties should be delineated and identified as
to their engineering significance as early as possible
during each geologic study. Planning study maps and
other large-scale drawings may require geologic
formations or groups of engineering geologic units with
descriptions of their engineering significance in
accompanying discussions.
Units should be differentiated by engineering properties
and not necessarily formal stratigraphic units where
differences are significant. Although stratigraphic
names are not required, units should be correlated to
stratigraphic names in the data report or by an
illustration, such as a stratigraphic column.
Stratigraphic names and ages (formation, member) may
be used as the rock unit name.
For engineering studies, each particular stratigraphic
unit may require further subdivisions to identify
engineering parameters. Examples of important
engineering properties are:
• Susceptibility to weathering or presence of
alteration
66

ROCKS
• Dominant discontinuity characteristics
• Hardness and/or strength
• Deformability
• Deletereous minerals or beds (such as swelling
susceptibility, sulfates, or clays)
For example, a Tertiary shale unit, Tsh, may be
differentiated as Tsh or Tsh if unit 2 contains bentonite
1 2
interbeds and unit 1 does not, and Tsh could be used as
c
a unit name for the bentonite beds. A chlorite schist unit,
Cs, may be differentiated as Cs or Cs where unit A
A B
contains higher percentages of chlorite or talc and is
significantly softer (different deformation properties) than
unit B. A metasediment unit, ms, may be further
differentiated on more detailed maps and logs as ms
sh
(shale) or ms (limestone). All differentiated units should
ls
be assigned distinctive map symbols and should be
described on the General Geologic Legend, Explanation,
and Notes drawings.
Descriptors and Descriptive Criteria for Physical
Characteristics of Rock
Lithologic Descriptors (Composition, Grain Size,
and Texture).—Provide a brief lithologic description of
the rock unit. This includes a general description of
mineralogy, induration, cementation, crystal and grain
sizes and shapes, textural adjectives, and color.
Lithologic descriptors are especially important for the
description of engineering geology subunits when rock
unit names are not specific. Examples of rock unit names
that are not specific are metasediments, Tertiary
intrusives, or Quaternary volcanics.
69
FIELD MANUAL
1. Composition.—Use standard adjectives such as
sandy, silty, calcareous, etc. Detailed mineral comp
osition generally is not necessary or desirable unless
useful in correlating units or indicating pertinent
engineering physical properties. Note unique
features such as fossils, large crystals, inclusions,
concretions, and nodules which may be used as
markers for correlations and interpretations.
2. Crystal or particle sizes and shapes.—
Describe the typical crystal or grain shapes and
provide a description of sizes present in the rock unit
based on the following standards:
• Igneous and metamorphic rocks.—Table 4-1 is
recommended for descriptions of crystal sizes in
igneous and metamorphic rocks. Crystal sizes
given in millimeters (mm) are preferred rather
than fractional inch (in) equivalents.

limits do not correspond to the Unified Soil
Classification System for soil particle size but are
used for the field description and petrographic
classification of rocks. These limits are the
accepted sizes in geologic literature and are used
by petrographic laboratories.
3. Textural adjectives.—Texture describes the ar-
rangements of minerals, grains, or voids. These
microstructural features can affect the engineering
properties of the rock mass. Use simple, standard,
textural adjectives or phrases such as porphyritic,
vesicular, scoriaceous, pegmatitic, granular, well
developed grains, dense, fissile, slaty, or amorphous.
Use of terms such as holohyaline, hypidiomorphic
granular, and crystaloblastic is inappropriate.
Textural terms which identify solutioning, leaching,
or voids in bedrock are useful for describing primary
texture, weathering, alteration, permeability, and
density.
The terminology which follows defines sizes of voids, or
holes in bedrock. However, when describing pits, vugs,
cavities, or vesicles, a complete description which includes
the typical diameter, or the "mostly" range, and the max-
imum size observed is required. For example:
". . . randomly oriented, elliptically shaped vugs range
mostly from 0.03 to 0.06 foot (ft) in diameter,
maximum size 0.2 foot; decreases in size away from
quartz-calcite vein; about 15 percent contain calcite
crystals. . .”
or
". . . cavity, 3.3 ft wide by 16.4 ft long by 2.3 ft high,

72
ROCKS
• Pit (pitted).—Pinhole to 0.03 ft [d in] (<1 to
10 mm) openings.
• Vug (vuggy).—Small opening (usually lined with
crystals) ranging in diameter from 0.03 ft [d in] to
0.33 ft [4 in] (10 to 100 mm).
• Cavity.—An opening larger than 0.33 ft [4 in]
(100 mm), size descriptions are required, and adjec-
tives such as small, or large, may be used, if defined.
• Honeycombed.—Individual pits or vugs are so
numerous that they are separated only by thin walls;
this term is used to describe a cell-like form.
• Vesicle (vesicular).—Small openings in volcanic
rocks of variable shape formed by entrapped gas
bubbles during solidification.
4. Color.—As a minimum, provide the color of wet
altered and unaltered or fresh rock. Reporting color
for both wet and dry material is recommended since
the colors may differ significantly and cause
confusion. The Munsell Color System, as used in the
Geologic Society of America Rock Color Chart [5], is
used to provide standard color names and assist in
correlation. The chart also provides uniform and
identifiable colors to others. Color designators are
optional unless necessary for clarity, e.g., light brown
(5YR 5/6). Terms such as banded, streaked, mottled,
speckled, and stained may be used to further describe
color. Also describe colors of bands, etc.
Bedding, Foliation, and Flow Texture.—These
features give the rock anisotropic properties or represent
potential failure surfaces. Continuity and thickness of
these features influence rock mass properties and cannot
73
FIELD MANUAL
always be tested in the laboratory. Descriptors in
table 4-3 are used to identify these thicknesses.

Weathering and Alteration.—
1. Weathering.—Weathering, the process of
chemical or mechanical degradation of rock, can
significantly affect the engineering properties of the
rock and rock mass. For engineering geology
descriptions, the term "weathering" includes both
chemical disintegration (decomposition) and
mechanical disaggregation as agents of alteration.
Weathering effects generally decrease with depth, al-
though zones of differential weathering can occur and
may modify a simple layered sequence of weathering.
74
ROCKS
Examples are: (1) differential weathering within a
single rock unit, apparently due to relatively higher
permeability along fractures; (2) differential
weathering due to compositional or textural
differences; (3) differential weathering of contact
zones associated with thermal effects such as
interflow zones within volcanics; (4) directional
weathering along permeable joints, faults, shears, or
contacts which act as conduits along which
weathering agents penetrate more deeply into the
rock mass; and (5) topographic effects.
Weathering does not correlate directly with specific
geotechnical properties used for many rock mass
classifications. However, weathering is important
because it may be the primary criterion for
determining depth of excavation, cut slope design,
method and ease of excavation, and use of excavated
materials. Porosity, absorption, compressibility,
shear and compressive strengths, density, and
resistance to erosion are the major engineering
parameters influenced by weathering. Weathering
generally is indicated by changes in the color and
texture of the body of the rock, color, and condition of
fracture fillings and surfaces, grain boundary
conditions, and physical properties such as hardness.
Weathering is reported using descriptors presented
in table 4-4, which divides weathering into categories
that reflect definable physical changes due to
chemical and mechanical processes. This table
summarizes general descriptions which are intended
to cover ranges in bedrock conditions. Weathering
tables are generally applicable to all rock types;
however, they are easier to apply to crystalline rocks
and rocks that contain ferromagnesian minerals.
Weathering in many sedimentary rocks will not
always conform to the criteria established in
75
FIELD MANUAL
table 4-4, and weathering categories may have to be
modified for particular site conditions. However, the
basic horizontal categories and descriptors presented
can be used. Site-specific conditions, such as fracture
openness, filling, and degree and depth of
penetration of oxidation from fracture surfaces,
should be identified and described.
2. Alteration.—Chemical alteration effects are
distinct from chemical and mechanical degradation
(weathering), such as hydrothermal alteration, may
not fit into the horizontal suite of weathering
categories portrayed in table 4-4. Oxides may or may
not be present. Alteration is site-specific, may be
either deleterious or beneficial, and may affect some
rock units and not others at a particular site. For
those situations where the alteration does not relate
well to the weathering categories, adjusting the
description within the framework of table 4-4 may be
necessary. Many of the general characteristics may
not change, but the degree of discoloration and
oxidation in the body of the rock and on fracture
surfaces could be very different. Appropriate
descriptors, such as moderately altered or intensely
altered, may be assigned for each alteration category.
Alteration products, depths of alteration, and
minerals should be described.
3. Slaking.—Slaking is another type of
disintegration which affects engineering properties of
rock. Terminology and descriptive criteria to identify
this deleterious property are difficult to standardize
because some materials air slake, many water slake,
and some only slake after one or more wet-dry cycles.
The Durability Index (DI) is a simplified method for
describing slaking. Criteria for the index are based

Note: This chart and its horizontal categories are more readily applied to rocks with feldspars and mafic minerals. Weathering in various sedimentary rocks, particularly limestones and poorly indurated
sediments, will not always fit the categories established. This chart and weathering categories may have to be modified for particular site conditions or alteration such as hydrothermal effects; however, the
basic framework and similar descriptors are to be used.
* Combination descriptors are permissible where equal distribution of both weathering characteristics are present over significant intervals or where characteristics present are “in between” the
diagnostic feature. However, dual descriptors should not be used where significant, identifiable zones can be delineated. When given as a range, only two adjacent terms may be combined (i.e., decomposed
to lightly weathered or moderately weathered to fresh) are not acceptable.
† Does not include directional weathering along shears or faults and their associated features. For example, a shear zone that carried weathering to great depths into a fresh rock mass would not require
the rock mass to be classified as weathered.
§ These are generalizations and should not be used as diagnostic features for weathering or excavation classification. These characteristics vary to a large extent based on naturally weak materials or
cementation and type of excavation.

specify whether the specimen or exposure is

slaking or durability, a complete description
includes the test exposure conditions. For

FIELD MANUAL
A field test suitable for evaluating the degree
and rate of slaking for materials, primarily
clayey materials and altered volcanics, is
described below. The slaking test evaluates the
disaggregation of an intact specimen in water
and reflects the fabric of the material, internal
stresses, and character of the interparticle
bonds.
To evaluate slaking behavior, immerse two
intact specimens (pieces of core or rock
fragments consisting of a few cubic inches or
centimeters) in water. One piece should be at
natural water content (wrapped jar sample) and
one piece from an air-dried sample. Test results
should be photographed with labels to identify
specimens and exposure times.
Results of the evaluation should be reported for
each specimen. Describe the behavior of the
specimens as follows:
a. Volume changes.—The volume of the material
reduced to individual particles should be estimated
and compared to the initial volume of material.
The degree of disaggregation is described using the
following descriptive criteria:
None No discernable disaggregation
Slight Less than 5 percent of the volume
disaggregated
Moderate Between 5 and 25 percent of the
volume disaggregated
Intense More than 25 percent but less
than the total volume
disaggregated
Complete No intact piece of the material
remains
80

b. Rate of slaking.—The following descriptors are
used to identify the time to slake:
Slow slaking Action continues for several hours
Moderate Action completed within 1 hour
slaking
Rapid Action completed within
slaking 2 minutes
Sudden Complete reaction, action com-
slaking pleted instantaneously
[Generally, slaking applies to rock; disaggregation applies
to soils.]
4. Character of material.—The character of the
remaining pieces of material after the test is
completed is described as follows:
No change Material remains intact
Plates remain Remaining material present as
platy fragments of generally
uniform thickness
Flakes remain Remaining material present as
flaky or wedge-shaped fragments
Blocks remain Blocky fragments remain
Grains remain Remaining material chiefly present
as sand-size grains
No fragments Remaining material entirely disag-
gregated to clay-size particles
Hardness—Strength.—Hardness can be related to
intact rock strength as a qualitative indication of density
and/or resistance to breaking or crushing. Strength is a
necessary engineering parameter for design that
81
FIELD MANUAL
frequently is not assessed, but plays a role in engineering
design and construction, such as tunnel support
requirements, bit wear for drilling or tunnel boring
machine (TBM) operations, allowable bearing pressures,
excavation methods, and support.
The hardness and strength of intact rock is a function of
the individual rock type but may be modified by
weathering or alteration. Hardness and strength are
described for each geologic unit when they are functions
of the rock type and also for zones of alteration or
weathering when there are various degrees of hardness
and/or strength due to different degrees of weathering or
chemical alteration. When evaluating strengths, it is
important to note whether the core or rock fragments
break around, along, or through grains; or along or across
incipient fractures, bedding, or foliation.
Hardness and especially strength are difficult
characteristics to assess with field tests. Two field tests
can be used; one is a measure of the ability to scratch the
surface of a specimen with a knife, and the other is the
resistance to fracturing by a hammer blow. Results from
both tests should be reported. The diameter and length
of core or the fragment size will influence the estimation
of strength and should be kept in mind when correlating
strengths. A 5- to 8-inch (130- to 200-mm) length of
N-size core or rock fragment, if available, should be used
for hardness determinations to preclude erroneously
reporting point, rather than average hardness, and to
evaluate the tendency to break along incipient fractures
and textural or structural features when struck with a
rock pick. Standards (heavy, moderate, and light
hammer blow) should be calibrated with other geologists
mapping or logging core for a particular project.
Descriptors used for rock hardness/strength are shown on
table 4-6.

Note: Although "sharp pick" is included in these definitions, descrip-
tions of ability to be scratched, grooved, or gouged by a knife is the
preferred criteria
A few empirical and quantitative field techniques which
are quick, easy, and inexpensive are available to provide
strength estimates. Quantitative strength estimates can
83
FIELD MANUAL
be obtained from the point load test. A lightweight and
portable testing device is used to break a piece of core
(with a minimum length at least 1.5 times the diameter)
between two loading points. If a new fracture does not
run from one loading point to the other upon completion
of the test, or if the points sink into the rock surface
causing excessive deformation or crushing, the test
should not be recorded. Raw data are given with the
reduced data (equations to empirically convert load data
to compressive strengths are usually supplied with the
equipment). The Schmidt (L) hammer may also be used
for estimating rock strengths; refer to Field Index Tests
in chapter 5. Each of these tests can be used to calibrate
the manual index (empirical) properties described in
table 4-6, and a range of compressive strengths can be
assigned. Depending on the scope of the study and
structure being considered, laboratory testing may be
required and used to confirm the field test data.
Discontinuities.—Describe all discontinuities such as
joints, fractures, shear/faults, and shear/fault zones, and
significant contacts. These descriptions should include all
observable characteristics such as orientation, spacing,
continuity, openness, surface conditions, and fillings.
Appropriate terminology, descriptive criteria and
descriptors, and examples pertaining to discontinuities
are presented in chapter 5.
Contacts.—Contacts between various rock units or rock/
soil units must be described. In addition to providing a
geologic classification, describe the engineering
characteristics such as the planarity or irregularity and
other descriptors used for discontinuities.
Descriptors applicable to the geologic classification of con-
tacts are:
84
ROCKS
• Conformable
• Unconformable
• Welded—contact between two lithologic units, one
of which is igneous, that has not been disrupted
tectonically
• Concordant (intrusive rocks)
• Discordant (intrusive rocks)
Descriptors pertinent to engineering classification of con-
tacts are:
• Jointed—contact not welded, cemented, or
healed—a fracture
• Intact
• Healed (by secondary process)
• Sharp
• Gradational
• Sheared
• Altered (baked or mineralized)
• Solutioned
If jointed or sheared, additional discontinuity descriptors
such as thickness of fillings, openness, moisture, and
roughness, should be provided also (see discontinuity
descriptors in chapter 5).
Permeability Data.—Permeability (hydraulic
conductivity) is an important physical characteristic that
must be described. Suggested methods for testing,
terminology, and descriptors are available in the Earth
Manual and Ground Water Manual. Numerical values
for hydraulic conductivity (K) can be determined using
any of several methods. These values may be shown on
drill hole logs. For narrative discussions or summary
descriptions, the numerical value and descriptors may be
used. Descriptors to be used—such as low,
85
FIELD MANUAL
moderate—are those shown on figure 4-7. Whether
permeability is primary (through intact rock) or
secondary (through fractures) should be indicated.

for describing bedrock in the physical conditions column

with heavy knife pressure; fresh N-size core breaks along

joints are variably spaced and discontinuous, spaced more
closely where weathered. Joint sets are prominent but
discontinuous. (Joint sets are identified in the
specifications paragraphs). Commonly altered 0.1 to 6 ft
along contacts of dikes and larger shears with epidote and
quartz ("altered amphibolite" on logs of exploration).
When altered, harder than amphibolite. Based on drill
hole permeability testing, hydraulic conductivity is very
low to low, with values ranging from 0.09 to 130 feet per
year (ft/yr) averages 1.5 ft/yr in slightly weathered and
fresh rock.

TERMINOLOGY AND DESCRIPTIONS
FOR DISCONTINUITIES
General
Structural breaks or discontinuities generally control the
mechanical behavior of rock masses. In most rock masses
the discontinuities form planes of weakness or surfaces of
separation, including foliation and bedding joints, joints,
fractures, and zones of crushing or shearing. These
discontinuities usually control the strength, deformation,
and permeability of rock masses. Most engineering
problems relate to discontinuities rather than to rock type
or intact rock strength. Discontinuities must be carefully
and adequately described. This chapter describes
terminology, indexes, qualitative and quantitative
descriptive criteria, and format for describing
discontinuities. Many of the criteria contained in this
chapter are similar to criteria used in other established
sources which are accepted as international standards
(for example, International Journal of Rock Mechanics,
1978 [1]).
Discontinuity Terminology
The use of quantitative and qualitative descriptors
requires that what is being described be clearly identified.
Nomenclature associated with structural breaks in
geologic materials is frequently misunderstood. For
example, bedding, bedding planes, bedding plane
partings, bedding separations, and bedding joints may
have been used to identify similar or distinctly different
geological features. The terminology for discontinuities
which is presented in this chapter should be used
uniformly for all geology programs. Additional definitions
for various types of discontinuities are presented in the
Glossary of Geology [2]; these may be used to further
describe structural breaks. The following basic defi-
nitions should not be modified unless clearly justified,
and defined.
FIELD MANUAL
Discontinuity.—A collective term used for all structural
breaks in geologic materials which usually have zero to
low tensile strength. Discontinuities also may be healed.
Discontinuities comprise fractures (including joints),
planes of weakness, shears/faults, and shear/fault zones.
Depositional or erosional contacts between various
geologic units may be considered discontinuities. For
discussion of contacts, refer to chapter 4.
Fracture.—A term used to describe any natural break in
geologic material, excluding shears and shear zones.
Examples of the most common fractures are defined as
follows:
1. Joint.—A fracture which is relatively planar
along which there has been little or no obvious
displacement parallel to the plane. In many cases, a
slight amount of separation normal to the joint
surface has occurred. A series of joints with similar
orientation form a joint set. Joints may be open,
healed, or filled; and surfaces may be striated due to
minor movement. Fractures which are parallel to
bedding are termed bedding joints or bedding plane
joints. Those fractures parallel to metamorphic
foliation are called foliation joints.
2. Bedding plane separation.—A separation along
bedding planes after exposure due to stress relief or
slaking.
3. Random fracture.—A fracture which does not
belong to a joint set, often with rough, highly
irregular, and nonplanar surfaces along which there
has been no obvious displacement.
4. Shear.—A structural break where differential
movement has occurred along a surface or zone of
92
DISCONTINUITIES
failure; characterized by polished surfaces, striations,
slickensides, gouge, breccia, mylonite, or any
combination of these. Often direction of movement,
amount of displacement, and continuity may not be
known because of limited exposures or observations.
5. Fault.—A shear with significant continuity which
can be correlated between observation locations;
foundation areas, or regions; or is a segment of a
fault or fault zone reported in the literature. The
designation of a fault or fault zone is a site-specific
determination.
6. Shear/fault zone.—A band of parallel or subpar-
allel fault or shear planes. The zone may consist of
gouge, breccia, or many fault or shear planes with
fractured and crushed rock between the shears or
faults, or any combination. In the literature, many
fault zones are simply referred to as faults.
7. Shear/fault gouge.—Pulverized (silty, clayey, or
clay-size) material derived from crushing or grinding
of rock by shearing, or the subsequent decomposition
or alteration. Gouge may be soft, uncemented,
indurated (hard), cemented, or mineralized.
8. Shear/fault breccia.—Cemented or uncemented,
predominantly angular (may be platy, rounded, or
contorted) and commonly slickensided rock
fragments resulting from the crushing or shattering
of geologic materials during shear displacement.
Breccia may range from sand-size to large boulder-
size fragments, usually within a matrix of fault
gouge. Breccia may consist solely of mineral grains.
9. Shear/fault-disturbed zone.—An associated
zone of fractures and/or folds adjacent to a shear or
93
FIELD MANUAL
shear zone where the country rock has been
subjected to only minor cataclastic action and may be
mineralized. If adjacent to a fault or fault zone, the
term is fault-disturbed zone. Occurrence,
orientation, and areal extent of these zones depend
upon depth of burial (pressure and temperature)
during shearing, brittleness of materials, and the in-
place stresses.
Terminology for joint (JT), foliation joint (FJ), bedding
joint (BJ), incipient joint (IJ) or incipient fracture (IF),
random fracture (RF), mechanical break (MB), and frac-
ture zone (FZ) is given on figure 5-9 (drawing No. 40-D-
6499 following later in this chapter). Suggested
abbreviations are in parentheses.
Indexes for Describing Fracturing
Fracture Density
Fracture density is based on the spacing between all
natural fractures in an exposure or core recovery lengths
from drill holes, excluding mechanical breaks, shears, and
shear zones; however, shear-disturbed zones (fracturing
outside the shear) are included. In this context, fracture
is a general term and includes all natural breaks such as
joints, bedding joints, foliation joints, and random
fractures. Fracture density should always be described in
physical measurements, but summary descriptive terms
relating to these measurements are a convenient aid in
communicating characteristics of the rock mass.
Standard descriptors apply to all rock exposures, such as
tunnel walls, dozer trenches, outcrops, or foundation cut
slopes and inverts, as well as boreholes. Fracture
94
DISCONTINUITIES
descriptors presented in table 5-1 and figure 5-9 are
based on drill hole cores where lengths are measured
along the core axis.
When describing fracture density, a percentage of the
types of fractures should be provided. A complete
description for fracture density might read: Slightly
Fractured (FD3), recovered core in 0.8- to 4.7-feet (0.2- to
1.4-meter [m]) lengths, mostly 1.7 feet (520 millimeters
[mm]), 25 percent bedding joints/75 percent joints.
Fracture Frequency
Fracture frequency is the number of fractures occurring
within a unit length. The number of natural fractures is
divided by the length and is reported as fractures per foot
or fractures per meter.
Rock Quality Designation
Rock Quality Designation (RQD) [2] is a fracture index
used in many rock classification systems. To determine
the RQD value, add the total length of solid core that is
4 inches (100 mm) or more long regardless of core
diameter. If the core is broken by handling or the drilling
process (mechanical breaks), the broken pieces are fitted
together and counted as one piece, provided that they
form the requisite length of 4 inches (100 mm). The
length of these pieces is measured along the centerline of
the core. This sum is divided by the length of the run
(drill interval) and recorded on the log as a percentage of
each run. Figure 5-1 illustrates RQD measurements and
procedures.
RQD estimates can be determined from outcrops. RQD =
115 - 3.3 where Jv equals the total number of joints in a
cubic meter. RQD may also be estimated from an

outcrop by determining the sum of solid rock (fracture
free) in lengths 4 inches long or greater along a line that
simulates either a 5- or 10-foot "core run." Detail line
surveys provide the data needed to calculate RQD.
Orienting the lines in different directions reduces
directional bias. Either of these methods offers an
advantage over RQDs determined from drill core, because
all fracture orientations are included. Also, these RQD
values more realistically represent rock conditions.
Description of Fractures
An accurate description of fractures is as important as the
physical characteristics of the rock mass. Fractures affect
and usually control the strength, deformation, and
permeability characteristics of a rock mass. Fractures are
grouped into sets based on similar orientations, and each
set is labeled and described. Along with the physical
measurements, such as attitude, spacing, and continuity,
include information such as composition, thickness, and
hardness of fillings or coatings; characteristics of surfaces
such as hardness, roughness, waviness, and alteration;
healing; fracture openness; and presence of water or
water flow. Joint and fracture properties also may be
useful for correlating purposes. Cleavage (CL) in
metamorphic rocks includes slaty cleavage, crenulation
cleavage, phyllitic structure, and schistosity (after Davis
[4]) and often can be used to evaluate the tectonic setting.
Figure 5-9 may be used for geologic reports or
specifications where the standard descriptors and
terminology established for discontinuities are used
during data collection.
98
DISCONTINUITIES
Format for the Description of Fractures
Identifying and recording the physical characteristics of
fractures during mapping and logging is the least
expensive part of most geologic investigations. An
accurate and concise description of these characteristics
permits interpretation in geologic terms directly
applicable to design and construction. As many of the
characteristics should be described as possible, limited
only by the type of observation. For example, continuity
and waviness cannot be provided for joints observed in
core. Examples of fracture descriptions recorded for a
drill hole log and for an outcrop or exposure are in a
following section. A general format for recording fracture
descriptions follows:
• Orientation
• Spacing
• Continuity
• Openness
• Fillings

FIELD MANUAL
Descriptors for Fracture Characteristics
The following paragraphs present terminology, descriptor
criteria, and descriptors for recording fracture data.
Alphanumeric descriptors are amenable to computer
sorting. Alphanumeric descriptors are not a substitute
for a complete description of the fracture characteristics.
Orientation.—The orientation of all fractures with
respect to applied loads can be critical to deformation or
stability. Seepage or grouting also may be affected or
controlled by orientation. Orientation is usually
measured in the field, and the raw data tabulated and
interpreted. The analysis typically includes stereonets,
contour diagrams, fracture sets, and their areal
distribution. A detailed statistical analysis of the fracture
data may be necessary. Azimuths or quadrants may be
used, but azimuths are becoming the standard, in part
because they are easier to computerize. The American
right-hand rule for dip direction notation is preferred.
The method of measuring the dip of planar dis-
continuities, foliation, and bedding in cores is shown in
figure 5-9. Figures 5-1 and 5-2 illustrate how inclination
of a joint in core from an angle hole can be interpreted as
a horizontal joint (A) or vertical joint (B) by rotating the
core 180 degrees (E). If the core is oriented and the top of
the core is known, the inclination can be recorded as
positive (+) or negative (-) to avoid ambiguity and to assist
in determining sets.
Fracture orientation is recorded as strike and dip, or as
azimuth and dip, preferably using the right-hand rule.
Orientation of planar features with undetermined strike
can be measured directly and reported as dip in vertical
holes. In angle holes, where true dip is not known, the
angle of the plane should be measured from the core axis
100
DISCONTINUITIES
and reported as inclination, i.e., "bedding plane joints
inclined 65 degrees from the core axis."
Spacing.—Spacing affects block size and geometry in the
rock mass. Spacing is a required input to several rock
mass classification systems. When a set can be distin-
guished (parallel or subparallel joints), true spacing can
be measured and is described for each joint set, as shown
on figure 5-2 and in table 5-2. If apparent spacing is
given, label as such.
Figure 5-2.—Comparison of true and apparent spacing.
Continuity.—A continuous joint or fracture is weaker
and more deformable than a short discontinuous fracture
bridged by intact bedrock. Recording trace lengths to
describe continuity is useful in large exposures.
Identification of the more continuous fractures is an
important aspect of formulating rock stability input data,
especially for high cut slopes and in large underground
openings. Record the longest observable trace regardless
of end type and note whether it is a strike (S), dip (D), or
apparent (A) trace. Descriptors for continuity are
provided in table 5-3.

C5 Very continuous Greater than 100 ft (>30 m)
This information alone is not sufficient to completely
assess joint or fracture continuity because trace lengths
may be partially obscured. When performing joint
studies or surveys, record the number of ends (fracture
terminations) that can be seen in the exposure using the
alphanumeric descriptors shown in table 5-4. The size of
the exposure should be noted because this is a
determining factor when surveying for visible ends.

fracture can be seen in the exposure).
E1 One end can be seen (one end of the fracture
terminates in the exposure).
E2 Both ends cannot be observed (two fracture ends
do not terminate in the exposure).
Openness.—The width or aperture is measured normal
to the fracture surface. This aperture or openness affects
the strength, deformability, and seepage characteristics.
Describe fracture openness by the categories shown in
table 5-5. For drill logs, if actual openness cannot be
measured or estimated, use only open or tight and do not
assign an alphanumeric descriptor.
Characteristics of Fracture Fillings.—Describing the
presence or absence of coatings or fillings and
distinguishing between types, alteration, weathering, and
strength and hardness of the filling material may be as
significant as fracture spatial relationships or planarity.
Strength and permeability of fractures may be affected
by fillings. Descriptions of fracture coatings and fillings
are site specific but must address the following
considerations:
1. Thickness of fillings.—Table 5-6 provides
descriptors for recording the thickness of fracture
fillings or coatings.

DISCONTINUITIES
2. Composition of fillings.—The mineralogical
classification of fillings, such as quartz, gypsum, and
carbonates, must be identified to convey physical
properties of fractures that may be significant
criteria for design. Soil materials in open fractures
should be described and classified according to the
Unified Soil Classification System (USCS) (see
USBR 5000 and USBR 5005 [5]).
Fractures may be filled or "healed" entirely or over a
significant portion of their areal extent by quartz,
calcite, or other minerals. Veins may be present
without healing the fracture or may have been
broken again forming new surfaces. Soluble fillings,
such as gypsum, may cause foundation or structural
degradation during the facility's expected lifetime.
Fracture fillings must be considered during design,
construction investigations, and monitoring or
potential long-term stability, deformability, and
seepage problems may require expensive
rehabilitation efforts.
Coatings or fillings of chlorite, talc, graphite, or other
low-strength materials need to be identified because
of their deleterious effects on strength, especially
when wet. Some fillings, such as dispersive, erosive,
or micaceous materials, can squeeze, pipe under fluid
flow, and contribute to a loss of strength and
stability. Montmorillonitic clays may swell or cause
swelling pressures. Cohesionless materials, such as
sands and silts, or materials which have been
crushed or altered may run or flow into underground
excavations or serve as seepage conduits.
105
FIELD MANUAL
3. Weathering or alteration.—Descriptors for
weathering or alteration of fracture fillings
(excluding soil materials) are the same as those used
for rock weathering.
4. Hardness/strength.—Descriptors for hardness/
strength of fillings should be the same as those
presented for bedrock hardness or soil consistency
(chapters 3 and 4). Various field index tests may also
be performed to determine strengths of fillings.
Refer to the Field Index Tests in chapter 4.
5. Healing.—Fractures may be healed or
recemented by one or more episodes of
mineralization or precipitation of soluble materials.
A description of fracture healing or rehealing should
include not only the type of healing or cementing
agent, but an estimate of the degree to which the
fracture has been healed. The subjective criteria and
descriptors shown in table 5-7 should be used to
describe healing.
Characteristics of Fracture Surfaces.—The physical
characteristics of fracture surfaces are very important for
deformability and stability analyses. Dimensional
characteristics such as roughness and waviness (see
figure 5-3) and characteristics, such as weathering and
hardness of the surfaces, are important in evaluating the
shear strength of fractures. Fracture roughness
descriptors are given in table 5-8. Surface characteristics
are less important only when low-strength materials
comprise fracture fillings.
The description of fracture asperities is divided into two
categories: small-scale asperities, or roughness, and
large-scale undulations, or waviness. Figure 5-3 shows
.

examples of these asperities. Descriptors for roughness
and waviness and additional items related to fracture
surfaces follow.
1. Roughness.—The roughness (small-scale asper-
ities) of fracture surfaces is critical for evaluating
shear strengths. Roughness descriptors such as
striated or slickensided should be used whenever
observed. For oriented core or outcrops, the
orientation of striations or slickensides should be
recorded. The rake of striations or slickensides
should be recorded when observed in core from
vertical drill holes which have not been oriented. In

exposures. This is done by recording amplitude and
wavelength, or as a minimum, describing as either

3. Weathering/alteration.—Weathering or altera-
tion of fracture surfaces is one of the criteria used for
classifying rock mass weathering. Even though it is
inherent in the weathering categories, the actual
description of surface alteration and the associated
loss of strength of the rock needs to be reported.
Qualitative information can be presented when
describing a particular joint set, joint, or fracture.
The condition of the surface(s), such as depth of
penetration and degree of staining or oxidation,
should be recorded.
Moisture Conditions.—The presence of moisture or the
potential for water flow along fractures may be an

Criteria and descriptors shown in table 5-9 describe
moisture conditions for fractures. The presence or
absence of moisture cannot be determined in core, but
evidence of previous long-term water flow is found in
leaching, color changes, oxidation, and dissolutioning.

flow such as staining, leaching, and vegetation.
M4 The fracture filling (where present) is damp, but
no free water is present.
M5 The fracture shows seepage and is wet with
occasional drops of water.
M6 The fracture emits a continuous flow (estimate
flow rate) under low pressure. Filling materials
(where present) may show signs of leaching or
piping.
M7 The fracture emits a continuous flow (estimate
flow rate) under moderate to high pressure.
Water is squirting, and/or filling material (where
present) may be substantially washed out.

DISCONTINUITIES
Field Index Tests
Schmidt Hammer tests can be used to estimate the hard-
ness/strength of the rock surfaces along a discontinuity
(which may be weaker than the body of the rock). The
rebound of a spring-actuated projectile is measured from
the surface being tested. The sample should be large
enough, preferably intact or securely fastened to a stable
base (i.e., concrete), so that it does not move during tests.
Unclamped specimens should measure at least 0.7 foot
(200 mm) in each direction. Direct testing on rock
outcrops is usually the best method. Results should be
obtained from both wet and dry surfaces. Ten readings
are taken at various locations on each surface. The five
lowest readings are discounted, and the five highest
readings are averaged to obtain a realistic rebound
number (Schmidt hardness). The hammer is always
oriented perpendicular to the surface being tested. A unit
dry weight must also be determined for the material
being tested. Using the Schmidt hardness and the unit
dry weight, the uniaxial compressive strength of the
sample can be estimated.
Tilt-type sliding-friction tests are also useful in
estimating the shear strength of fractures. Samples can
be obtained from outcrops or rock core. A representative
sample is tilted, and the angle at which the top of the
sample slides relative to the bottom is measured. This
angle is an approximation of the friction angle. Both wet
and dry surfaces should be tested. The weight, thickness,
and approximate dimensions of the sample parts also are
recorded. A friction angle can be estimated in a similar
manner using three pieces of core. Two representative
pieces of core are used as a base, and the third piece is
placed on top. The base is then tilted until the top piece
of core slides, and this angle is measured.
111
FIELD MANUAL
Pocket penetrometers may be used to estimate the
strength of soil-like fillings or surfaces. The surface or a
filling is penetrated by the penetrometer to the line on
the penetrometer (about a quarter of an inch), and the
approximate compressive strength is read directly from a
calibrated scale on the penetrometer.
Example Descriptions of Fractures
The examples which follow show a representative format
for recording data. Actual descriptions vary and depend
on whether the observations were recorded from
exposures, drill core, or detailed joint surveys. Data
report descriptions of discontinuities should be expanded
to provide ranges and typical characteristics or additional
significant data for each set or individual fractures from
all observations.
Drill Core.—The following metric example is taken from
a log of a rock core interval from a vertical drillhole; in an
angle hole, orientation would be recorded as inclination
from the core axis:
“. . . Moderately to slightly fractured (35%
bedding joints, 65% joints). Core recovered in
210 to 730 mm lengths, mostly as 300 mm
lengths. Bedding joints dip 30 to 35E, widely
spaced (SP3) at 370 to 790 mm, avg 580 mm; 29
are tight, 6 are open; all are clean; 20 are
moderately rough (R3), 15 are slightly rough
(R4); oxidation penetrates 30 mm from surfaces
(W4); all surfaces can be scratched by moderate
knife pressure (H4). Joint set A dips 50 to 75E,
mostly 60 to 65E, normal bedding; very widely
spaced (SP2) at 0.9 to 1.2 m, avg 1 m; 3 are open,
1 is tight, and 9 are tight and healed by 3 to
30 mm thick, fresh (W1), very hard (H2), quartz-
calcite fillings; the 3 open joints are clean,
slightly rough (R4), oxidation stains penetrate
112
DISCONTINUITIES
60 mm from surfaces (W4) which can be
scratched by light to moderate knife pressure, all
3 show evidence of water flow (W6) . . .. ”
Exposure Mapping.—An example of fracture
descriptions for an exposure, using English units, follows:
“Joint set A-1 strikes N. 20-38E W., mostly N. 20-
25E W.; dips 50-65E NE, averages 54E NE. Very
widely spaced (SP2), 3.8 to 7.3 ft apart, mostly
5 ft apart; most have moderately to highly
continuous (C3 to C4) 25 to 55 ft trace lengths.
Approx. 60% are open to moderately wide (O3 to
O4), ranging in openness from 0.1 to 0.3 ft,
remainder are tight to slightly open (O0 to O1).
Approx. 10% of the joints contain thin, hard
quartz fillings, 25% are clean, and 65% contain
firm fat clay (CH) fillings which can be indented
with thumbnail. All rock surfaces are
moderately weathered with dendritic iron oxide
staining which can be scratched with light to
moderate knife pressure. Most surfaces are
slightly rough (R4) and undulatory, approx. 20%
are rough (R2) and planar. Undulations have
wavelengths of 10 to 20 ft, average 15 ft, and
amplitudes range from 0.2 to 0.5 ft. Clean joints
are dry but show evidence of moisture flow (M3),
most clay filled joints are damp but show no
evidence of flow (M4).”
Fracture Survey.—Statistical evaluations are valuable,
so it is important to collect joint properties for analysis.
This can be readily accomplished using fracture survey
techniques. Data sheets are prepared with appropriate
columns for recording the data, a traverse distance and
113
FIELD MANUAL
direction are established, and all pertinent data are
measured and recorded. Data are analyzed using
statistical methods. Refer to chapter 7 for detailed
descriptions of discontinuity surveys.
Descriptions of Shears and Shear Zones
Shear, fault, and associated terminology are defined at
the beginning of this chapter. The following describes a
method to classify shears, shear zones, and their
associated features. A format to describe and quantify
shear and fault physical characteristics and example
descriptions is provided. For each discussion, the word
"fault" can be substituted for "shear."
Identification or Naming of Shears
Significant shears should be named for ease of identifi-
cation in logs of exploration, mapping of exposures, inter-
pretations on geologic drawings, discussion in reports,
sample identification, and design treatment. Identifica-
tion of a shear or shear zone by letter/number desig-
nation, such as S-9 (shear zone No. 9) or F-1 (fault zone
No. 1), is recommended. Major splays may be identified
by an appropriate combination of letters and numbers
such as S-la or F-2c. Shears also may be named by their
location such as "powerplant shear," "Salt Creek Shear
zone," or "left abutment fault" if only a few shears are
present in the study area.
Uniform and Structured Shear Zones
The identification and correlation of shears and shear
zones from multiple but separate observations in
boreholes, trenches, and limited outcrops are often
difficult. The identification and description of shear and
114
DISCONTINUITIES
shear zone components and their physical characteristics
are necessary to both assist in correlating observations
and for design analyses. Together with physical meas-
urements of attitude and thickness, the description of the
component parts and internal structure of a shear may be
used for correlation in much the same way that
geophysical signatures or lithology are used to identify
certain stratigraphic units. The composition of a shear or
shear zone at each exposure can be described as either
uniform or structured. Illustrated in figure 5-4 is a
0.5-foot (150-mm) thick uniform shear composed of
40 percent breccia distributed relatively uniformly
throughout 60 percent clay gouge. Although the shear
contains two components, clay gouge and brecciated
fragments, the components are distributed uniformly
throughout the 0.5-foot shear zone.
Figure 5-4.—Uniform shear zone.
In contrast, a structured shear zone is composed of two or
more zones which differ significantly in composition or
physical properties. A structured shear zone could consist
of components similar to the uniform shear described
above with an additional 0.2-foot (60-mm) thick quartz
vein along one contact, as shown on figure 5-5.
A more complex structured shear zone might have a
0.1-foot (30-mm) thick chloritic gouge layer adjacent to
the vein as shown on figure 5-6.
115
FIELD MANUAL
Figure 5-5.—Structured shear zone
(two zones or layers).
Figure 5-6.—Structured shear zone (three layers).
Numerous small quartz-calcite or other mineral veinlets
commonly occur irregularly distributed throughout
shears. The veinlets do not form distinct layers; there-
fore, they should be considered a percentage component
of a uniform shear as illustrated on figure 5-7.
Figure 5-7.—Uniform shear zone with veinlets.
116
DISCONTINUITIES
Shear zones may have minor or major lateral variations
in the percentages of components within short distances
at an exposure. The shear zone illustrated in figure 5-4
consists of 60 percent clay gouge and 40 percent rock
fragments. Because the various components are not
arranged in layers, the shear is of the uniform type. In
an adjacent tunnel, the same shear zone may consist of
40 percent clay gouge and 60 percent rock fragments. If
the exposure is limited, as in most tunnels or exploratory
trenches, the percentages of the various components
should be averaged, as illustrated on figure 5-8, and the
average composition should be described.
Figure 5-8.—Uniform shear zone (composite).
Descriptors and Description Format for Shears and
Shear Zones
For shears to be uniformly and adequately described, a
brief discussion of each applicable item in the following
list should be included. The recommended format for
describing a shear or shear zone, either uniform or
structured as follows:
• Attitude
• Thickness
117
FIELD MANUAL
• Composition
Gouge
Percent by volume
Color
Moisture content
Consistency (hardness/strength)
Composition
Occurrence — layers or matrix
Breccia
Percent by volume
Fragment size(s)
Fragment shape(s)
Fragment surface characteristics
Lithology
Hardness/strength
Other components (vein or dike materials)
Percentage
Thickness
Composition (mineralogy, texture, fracturing,
etc.)
• Healing
• Zone strength
• Direction of movement (if determinable)
Attitude.—Measure strike and dip in exposures and
from oriented core, report dip in vertical core, and
measure angle from core axis for inclined drill core.
Report an average figure if only moderate variations are
observed. Provide both a range and average if large
variations in orientation are apparent.
Thickness.—Report the true thickness of the shear or
shear zone. True thickness can be measured directly or
computed. Indicate an average figure for minor
variations, as well as a range and average for significant
118
DISCONTINUITIES
variations. Do not include associated features beyond
the shear contacts (the shear-disturbed zone), or intact
blocks of rock around which the shear has bifurcated as
components of the thickness.
Composition.—Report an average percentage for each
description-format component. The various layers or
zones of structured shears may be indicated by use of
bracketed numbers [i.e., shear 1(1), 1(2)]. Describe each
individual layer or zone in the order it occurs as if each
were a uniform shear.
1. Gouge.—
• Percentage.—Report an average percent by
volume for each exposure or layer.
• Color.—Report color to help distinguish between
several types of gouge or to indicate alteration.
The Munsel Color System can be used to record
both the wet and dry color.
• Moisture content.—Describe the apparent
moisture content upon initial exposure, using the
following terms: wet (visible free water); moist
(damp but without visible water); and dry (absence
of moisture, dusty, dry to the touch).
• Consistency (strength/hardness).—Report
the ease with which gouge can be worked by hand:
Very soft [thumb penetrates gouge more than 1 in
(25 mm) if the gouge occurs in a sufficient
quantity]; soft [easily molded, penetration of
thumb about 1 in (25 mm)]; firm [easily crumbled,
can be penetrated by thumb up to 1/4 in : (5 mm)];
hard (can be broken with finger pressure, no
indentation with thumb, readily indented with
119
FIELD MANUAL
thumbnail); and very hard (cannot be indented
with thumbnail). Use a pocket penetrometer to
estimate gouge strength.
• Composition.—Report identifiable mineral
types; talc, chlorite, mica. Otherwise, report the
soil classification group name and/or symbol, such
as CH, ML, lean clay, etc.
• Occurrence.—Describe how the gouge occurs,
such as thin coatings on fragments, a matrix, or a
layer.
2. Breccia.—
• Percentage.—Report an average percent by
volume for each exposure or layer.
• Fragment size.—Estimate or measure the
dimension of the most common fragment sizes and
report as a range. Use fractions of an inch and
tenths of a foot or metric equivalents.
• Fragment shape.—Unless the distribution of
several shapes is nearly equal, report the most
common shapes and degree of angularity as shown
in figure 5-9.
• Fragment characteristics.—These should be
included because they affect or provide an
indication of the strength of the zone or help to
identify a particular zone in several exposures or
observations. Descriptions should include striated,
slickensided, polished, rough, chloritic coatings,
and weathering.

DISCONTINUITIES
Figure 5-9.—Standard descriptors and descriptive
criteria for discontinuities.
121
FIELD MANUAL
122
DISCONTINUITIES
• Lithology.—The identification of rock
fragments (rock type) is essential, particularly if
different from the surrounding rock mass or if
several rock types are present in the zone.
Indicate if fragments within the zone are altered.
• Fragment hardness/strength.—Describe how
the average-size fragment can be broken across its
least dimension using the following format: can
be broken with (light, moderate, heavy) manual
pressure or hammer blow.
3. Other components (vein or dike material).—
Describe any large veins or dikes which occur within
the shear, either as a component of a uniform shear
zone, usually occurring in the form of branching,
discontinuous veinlets less than 1/2-inch (13-mm)
thick, or as a layer (zone) within a structured shear.
Dikes or large veins should be included as a single
layer of a shear zone if they are bounded by shears.
Also, they should be described as a rock unit. If a
shear occurs only along one border of a dike or vein,
the dike or vein should be described only as a rock
unit.
• Percentage.—Report as an average percent by
volume for the exposure or layer.
• Thickness.—Report as an average or range of
thickness.
• Composition.—Provide a brief description of
mineralogy and texture (e.g., leached, vuggy).
Fracture density may be reported here if
significant.
123
FIELD MANUAL
Healing.—Small veinlets which are components of a
uniform shear zone and which actually form a bond
between fragments tend to increase the strength of the
shear zone (see following section). Healing should be
determined by attempting to separate fragments
manually or using a rock or pick. If fragments are
bonded by some healing or cementing agent, the shear
zone is described as partly healed (less than 50 percent
of fragments bonded), mostly healed (more than 50
percent of fragments bonded), and totally healed (all
fragments bonded by vein material).
Zone Strength.—When possible, the strength of the
entire shear zone exposed in outcrops, tunnels, and
exploratory trenches should be reported by the ease of
which the sheared material can be dug from the
exposure. The following guide is to be used: can be dug
from wall, floor, or outcrop with light, moderate, or
heavy finger pressure or hammer blow. Strength should
be reported for each significant layer of a shear zone.
Direction of Movement.—If determinable, the amount,
direction, and type of displacement are reported. Type
and direction of displacement (dip-slip, strike-slip,
oblique-slip, normal, reverse, right-lateral) may be
directly observable as shown by drag, tension fractures,
striations, offset "marker units" (such as beds, dikes,
veins, or other structural units). The amount of both
horizontal and vertical separation and, if possible, a net-
slip solution should be included. Regional stress fields
may be used to postulate displacement in the absence of
site observations.
124
DISCONTINUITIES
Example Descriptions for Shears and Shear Zones
The following are example descriptions for both a
uniform and a structured shear zone; actual descriptions
may depend on the type of observation.
A description, using metric units, of a uniform shear in
an angle hole could be:
“21.30 to 22.31: Shear. 210 mm thick, upper
contact inclined 40E, lower contact inclined 61E
from core axis, averages 51E, parallel to
bedding. Composed of approx. 15%, blackish-
green, moist, soft, chloritic clay and 85% 2 to 10
mm thick platy and lens-shaped, subrounded,
polished, intensely weathered (W7)
metasandstone fragments. Fragments break
with light hand pressure. Fragments partly
healed by 1 mm thick quartz-calcite veinlets.”
A structured shear zone in a vertical drill hole core could
be reported in English units as:
“118.6 to 121.9': Shear zone. 2.3 ft thick, upper
and lower contacts dip 40 to 45E, subparallel to
foliation. Zone 1, upper 0.3 ft; consists of 45%
green, moist, soft, chloritic clay gouge and 55%
0.05 to 0.1 ft subrounded, blocky, polished, fresh
dike fragments; fragments break with moderate
hammer blow. Zone 2 is 1.1 ft thick; consists of
very intensely fractured, fresh dike which is
partly healed by 0.01 to 0.3 ft-thick calcite
veinlets and a 0.l ft-thick, vuggy quartz-calcite
vein at base of dike. Zone 3 is 0.5 ft of No
Recovery. Zone 4, the lower 0.3 ft; consists of
70% gray, moist, firm, silty gouge, and 15% 0.01
to 0.03 ft-thick, wedge-shaped, fresh, striated
125
FIELD MANUAL
horn-blende schist fragments, and 15% 0.02 ft-thick,
angular, blocky, fresh quartz fragments. Fragments
break with light hammer blow.”
Description of Shear-Disturbed Zones
Fractures, fracture zones, drag zones, mineralized
bedrock, and dikes or large veins along which one contact
is sheared but are not themselves sheared or enclosed
within a zone, are not included in the thickness of a
shear or shear zone. The associated zone should be
identified to adequately describe geologic conditions of
engineering significance. For example, the shear-
disturbed zone and an adjacent dike might be described
as:
“. . . The shear is bounded by a 1.5- to 4-ft wide
shear-disturbed zone of very intensely to
intensely fractured chloritized dike (FD8). This
zone averages 3 ft wide along the upper contact
and 2 ft wide in the associated chloritized dike
adjacent to the lower contact. Hydrothermal
alteration consisting of epidote, chlorite, pyrite,
and quartz extends irregularly outward 2 to 7 ft
normal to the shear boundaries.”

GEOLOGIC MAPPING AND
DOCUMENTATION
Geologic mapping is defined as the examination of
natural and manmade exposures of rock or uncon-
solidated materials, the systematic recording of geologic
data from these exposures, and the analysis and inter-
pretation of these data in two- or three-dimensional
format (maps, cross sections, and perspective [block]
diagrams). The maps and cross sections generated from
these data: (1) serve as a record of the location of factual
data; (2) present a graphic picture of the conceptual
model of the study area based on the available factual
data; and (3) serve as tools for solving three-dimensional
problems related to the design, construction, and/or
maintenance of engineered structures or site characteri-
zation. This chapter presents guidelines for the
collection and documentation of surface and subsurface
geologic field data for use in the design, specifications,
construc-tion, or maintenance of engineered structures
and site characterization studies.
Responsibilities of the Engineering Geologist
An engineering geologist defines, evaluates, and docu-
ments site-specific geologic conditions relating to the
design, construction, maintenance, and remediation of
engineered structures or other sites. This responsibility
also may include more regionally based geologic studies,
such as materials investigations or regional reconnais-
sance mapping. An engineering geologist engaged in
geologic mapping is responsible for:
• Recognizing the key geologic conditions in a study
area that will or could significantly affect hazardous
and toxic waste sites or a proposed or existing
structure;
FIELD MANUAL
• Integrating all the available, pertinent geologic
data into a rational, interpretive, three-dimensional
conceptual model of the study area and presenting
this conceptual model to design and construction
engineers, other geologists, hydrologists, site
managers, and contractors in a form that can be
understood.
The process and responsibilities of engineering geology
mapping are illustrated in figure 6-1.
The engineering geologist needs to realize that geologic
mapping for site characterization is a dynamic process of
gathering, evaluating, and revising geologic data and
that the significance of these data, both to the structure
and to further exploration, must be continually assessed.
The initial exploration program for a structure is always
based on incomplete data and must be modified
continuously as the site geology becomes better
understood. The key to understanding the site geology
is through interpretive geologic drawings such as
geologic maps, cross sections, isopachs, and contour
maps of surfaces. These working drawings, periodically
revised and re-interpreted as new data become available,
are continuously used to assess the effects of the site
geology and to delineate areas where additional explora-
tion is needed. These drawings are used in designs,
specifica-tions, and modeling and maintained in the
technical record of the project.
Development of a Study Plan
Prior to mapping any project, a study plan must be
developed. Depending on the complexity of the site
geology, the nature of the engineered structure, and the
level of
130
131
MAPPING
Figure 6-1.—Process of engineering geology mapping.
FIELD MANUAL
previous studies, the study plan may be preliminary or
comprehensive. Although elements of the plan may be
modified, expanded, or deleted as geologic data become
available, the primary purpose of the study plan—
coordination among all geologists and engineers working
on the project—should be retained. Early study plan
development and agreement to this plan by those
involved in the project are necessary to prevent the
collection of unneeded, possibly costly data and ensure
needed data are available at the correct time in the
analysis, design, and construction process.
Scope of Study
The purpose and scope of the mapping project are
strongly influenced by the primary engineering and
geologic considerations, the level of previous studies, and
overall job schedules. The purpose and scope are
formulated jointly by the geologists and engineers on the
project. Time of year and critical dates for needed
information also will have a great impact on the pace of
data collection and the personnel needed to handle a
mapping project. Discussion of these factors prior to
initiating the mapping program is essential so that only
necessary data are obtained and the work can be
completed on schedule. Items to consider when defining
the scope of a mapping program are:
1. Study limits.—Set general regional and site study
limits based on engineering and geologic needs.
2. Critical features and properties.—Determine the
critical geologic features and physical properties of site
materials that will need to be defined and discuss the
difficulties in collecting data on these features.
132
MAPPING
3. Schedules.—Determine schedules under which the
work will be performed and define key data due dates.
Prioritize work to be done. The time of year the mapping
is to be performed, the type of mapping required,
available personnel and their skills, the availability of
support personnel such as drill crews and surveyors, and
budget constraints will influence the work schedule and
must be carefully evaluated.
4. Extent of previous studies.—Collect and study all
available geologic literature for the study area. The ex-
tent and adequacy of previous studies helps to define the
types of mapping required and how data will be
collected, i.e., based on analyses, design, or construction
needs.
5. Photography.—Aerial and terrestrial photo-
graphy should be considered for any project. As a mini-
mum, aerial photographs of the site should be reviewed.
Aerial photographs reveal features that are difficult to
recognize from the ground or at small scales. Extensive
use of terrestrial or aerial photography will require a
different approach to the mapping program. Define
areas where terrestrial photogrammetry could aid
mapping progress. Terrestrial photography of various
types is an integral part of the final study record.
Specific Mapping Requirements
This section provides the basic considerations an
engineering geologist should evaluate prior to starting
any mapping project or portion of a mapping project.
Map Type
Define the types of mapping required and how data are
to be collected, including special equipment needed for
133
FIELD MANUAL
data collection. The types of mapping required depend
on the study purpose or the type of structure or site that
is to be built or rehabilitated, structure size, the phase of
study (planning through operation and maintenance),
and the specific design needs.
Scales and Controls
Define the required scales for design or construction
needs. Although finished maps can be enlarged or
reduced photographically or by Computer-Aided Drafting
Design (CADD)-generated drawings to any desired scale,
in most cases map text and symbols will have to be
redone for legibility. Selection of an adequate map scale
at the beginning of a mapping project will save time and
energy as well as help ensure that the types of data
needed can be portrayed adequately on the final
drawings. Suggested map scales for various types of
investigations are listed under specific mapping
techniques.
The horizontal and vertical accuracy and precision of
locations on a map depend on the spatial control of the
base map. General base map controls are listed in
decreasing significance: (1) Survey Control or Controlled
Terrestrial Photogrammetry—geology mapped from
survey controlled observation points or by plane table or
stadia; (2) Existing Topographic Maps—control for these
maps vary with scale. The most accurate are large-scale
photogrammetric topographic maps generated from
aerial photographs for specific site studies; (3)
U n c o n t r o l l e d A e r i a l / T e r r e s t r i al
Photogrammetry—Camera lens distor-tion is the chief
source of error; (4) Brunton Compass/ Tape Surveys—can
be reasonably accurate if measure-ments are taken with
care; and (5) Sketch Mapping— Practice is needed to
make reasonably accurate sketch
134
MAPPING
maps. The Global Positioning System can provide ade-
quate position locations depending on the required
accuracy or precision.
Global Positioning System
The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a system of
satellites that provides positioning data to receivers on
earth. The receiver uses the positioning data to calculate
the location of the receiver on earth. Accuracy and type
of data output depends on many factors that must be
evaluated before using the system. The factors that
must be evaluated are: (1) the needs of the project, (2)
the capabilities of the GPS equipment, and (3) the
parameters necessary for collecting the data in an
appropriate form.
Project Requirements
The location accuracy or precision needed by the project
is a controlling factor whether GPS is appropriate for the
project. The actual needs of the project should be deter-
mined, being careful to differentiate with “what would be
nice.” Costs should be compared between traditional
surveying and GPS.
GPS Equipment
Different GPS receiver/systems have different
accuracies. Accuracies can range from 300 ft to inches
(100 m to cm) depending on the GPS system. Costs
increase exponen-tially with the increase in accuracy. A
realistic evalua-tion of the typical accuracy of the
equipment to be used is necessary, and a realistic
evaluation of the needed, not “what would be nice,”
accuracy is important. Possible accuracy and typical
accuracy are often not the same.
135
FIELD MANUAL
Datums
The datum or theoretical reference surface to be used for
the project must be determined at the start. U.S.
Geologi-cal Survey (USGS) topographic maps commonly
use North American Datum (NAD) 27, but most new
surveys use NAD 83. Changing from one datum to
another can result in apparent location differences of
several hundred feet or meters if not done properly.
Map Projections
The map projection is the projection used to depict the
round shape of the earth on a flat plane or map. The
most common projections used in the United States are
the Transverse Mercator and the Lambert Conformal
Conic. State plane coordinate systems almost
exclusively use one or the other. To use these state
plane projections, location and definition parameters are
necessary. Table 6-1 has the types of projections and the
projection parameters for each state in the United
States. A discussion of map projections and coordinate
systems is in Map Projections - A Working Manual,
USGS Profes-sional Paper 1395[1].
Transverse Mercator.—The Transverse Mercator
projection requires a central meridian, scale reduction,
and origin for each state or state zone.
Lambert Conformal Conic.—The Lambert Conformal
Conic projection requires two standard parallels and an
origin for each state or state zone.
Coordinate System.—The coordinate system is the grid
system that is to be used on the project. The state plane

Note: All these systems are based on the Clarke 1866 ellipsoid and are
based on the 1927 datum. Origin refers to rectangular coordinates.
1 The major and minor axes of the ellipsoid are taken at exactly
1.0000382 times those of the Clarke 1866, for Michigan only. This
incorporates an average elevation throughout the State of about 800 ft,
with limited variation.

State Plane Coordinate Systems-changes for 1983
datum.—This listing indicates changes for the NAD
1983 datum from projections, parameters, and origins of
zones for the NAD 1927 datum. State plane coordinates
based on the 1927 datum cannot be correctly converted
to coordinates on the 1983 datum merely by using
inverse formulas to convert from 1927 rectangular
coordinates to latitude and longitude, and then using
142
MAPPING
forward formulas with this latitude and longitude to
convert to 1983 rectangular coordinates. Due to
readjustment of the survey control networks and to the
change of ellipsoid, the latitude and longitude also
change slightly from one datum to the other.
These changes are given in the same order as the entries
in the 1927 table, except that only the changes are
shown. All parameters not listed remain as before,
except for the different ellipsoid and datum. Because all
coordinates at the origin have been changed, and because
they vary considerably, the coordinates are presented in
the body of the table rather than as footnotes. Somoa is
not being changed to the new datum.

FIELD MANUAL
Units
English or metric units should be selected as early in the
project as possible. Conversions are possible, but
convert-ing a large 1-foot contour map to meters is no
trivial matter.
Remember that when using several sources of location
data, the reference datum must be known. Systematic
differences in location data are generally due to mixing
datums.
Specific Nomenclature and Definitions
Establish a uniform nomenclature system with written
definitions for rock types, map units, and map symbols
used. The American Geologic Institute Glossary of
Geology [2] is the standard for geologic terms except
where Reclamation has established definitions for its
own needs. These definitions and nomenclature are
discussed in chapters 2 through 5.
Field Equipment and Techniques
General geologic mapping equipment and techniques are
discussed in field geology manuals such as Lahee (1961)
[3] and Compton (1985) [4]. Refer to these texts for dis-
cussions of suggested field equipment and general
geologic mapping techniques.
Use of Computers
Computers are used during a mapping program in four
basic ways: (1) to process and analyze voluminous
numerical data (e.g., joint data), (2) as a tool in the
analysis of basic geologic data (e.g., construction of pre-
liminary or final plan and section views which
148
MAPPING
incorporate previously entered geologic data),
(3) Computer Aided Drafting and Design (CADD) of
section and plan views, and (4) in modeling geologic
conditions. How computers will be used in the reduction,
analysis, and drafting of the geologic data generated
during a mapping program needs to be decided early
because records of field data will depend on whether
data are to be stored in digital format and restructuring
these data at a later date is costly, time consuming, and
introduces transcription errors.
Right-of-Way
Right-of-way is needed for any mapping of non-
Reclamation land and should be obtained early to
prevent work delays. Although "walk on" permission
usually is obtained easily, permission for trenching and
drilling may take several months, especially if
archeological or environmental assessment is necessary.
Records
Systematic methods of recording field observations,
traverse data, outcrop data, and trench logs are
important. Suggested sample field book formats are
shown under each section below dealing with specific
mapping procedures, but any format should allow clear
representation of the field data.
Geologic Considerations
The following are some key items that should be
evaluated during a mapping project. The degree of
importance varies with the project but the factors are
common to most.
149
FIELD MANUAL
Lithology.—Differentiation between the various geo-
logic deposits and lithologies in a study area is basic to
geologic mapping. However, an engineering geologist is
more concerned with the engineering characteristics of
the unit than with its geologic definition, and these char-
acteristics should be the controlling factor in how geo-
logic units are subdivided. For some engineering
geologic purposes, it may be reasonable to consolidate
geologic units with similar engineering properties into a
single engineering geologic map unit. Depending on the
needs of the project, lithologic subunits may be defined
jointly between the engineers and the geologists working
on the job.
After the basic geologic subdivisions for a mapping job
have been agreed upon, detailed descriptions of each
subunit should be compiled and mapping symbols
selected. Map unit definitions usually will apply
specifically to the job or project area and normally will be
modified as additional data are collected. Map symbols
fall into several categories. American Geological
Institute data sheets have a comprehensive tabulation of
symbols.
Geologic contacts.—Two different line types normally
are used on geologic maps to denote the precision and
accuracy of geologic contacts. These are solid and broken
(dashed or dotted) lines. Solid lines usually are used
where exposures are excellent, such as a cleaned
foundation or an area with nearly continuous outcrops.
Solid lines indicate that the contacts are located with a
prescribed degree of accuracy. Broken contacts are used
when unsure of the accurate location of the contact, i.e.,
when the contact is covered by thin slopewash deposits
(dashed line) or where the contact is buried by deep
surficial deposits (dotted line). Confidence levels,
expressed in feet or meters, for both types of contacts
should be stated clearly in the definition of the contact
150
MAPPING
line. The mapper should keep in mind the type of geo-
logic data being compiled and use the appropriate line.
Discontinuities.—Discontinuities separate geological
materials into discrete blocks that can control the
stability and bearing capacity of a foundation or slope.
Intersecting discontinuities in cut slopes can form
unstable wedges. Because of the destabilizing or
weakening effects, mapping and adequately describing
discontinuities is critical in engineering geology studies.
The various types of discontinuities and the terminology
for describing their engineering properties are discussed
in chapter 5.
Weathering and alteration.—The mechanical and
chemical alteration of geological materials can signifi-
cantly affect stability and bearing strengths. Adequately
determining weathering depths, extent of altered
materials and the engineering properties of these
weathered and altered materials is critical in
engineering geologic mapping. Refer to chapter 4 for
definitions of weathering and alteration descriptors.
Water.—The location and amount of groundwater to be
expected in an excavation and how it can be controlled is
critical to the overall success of a project.
Geomorphology.—Study of landforms is often the key
to interpreting the geologic history, structure, lithology,
and materials at a site. Exploration programs can be
better designed and implemented using landforms as a
basis. The geomorphic history is important in
determining the relative age of faults.
Vegetation indicators.—Differences in vegetation
types and patterns can provide indirect data on
lithologies, dis-continuities, weathering, groundwater,
151
FIELD MANUAL
and mineralization. The water holding capacity of soil
developed on one rock (e.g., shale) may differ con-
siderably from the water holding capacity of soil
developed on another type of rock (e.g., sandstone);
consequently, the types of vegetation that grow in these
soils can vary considerably. Minerals present in the
parent rock may affect soil chemistry and may limit
vegetation to types tolerant of highly acidic or alkaline
soils or high concentrations of trace elements.
Vegetation seeking groundwater moving up major joints
and faults will form vegetation lineations that are highly
visible on aerial photographs, particularly color infrared
photo-graphs. In most locations, local conditions have to
be assessed to use vegetative indicators effectively.
Cultural features (manmade).—Cultural features,
such as water, gas or oil wells, road cuts or foundation
excavations, can provide surface and subsurface data
and should be reviewed early in the mapping project.
When data collection through trenching and core drilling
programs is considered, buried utility lines (water, gas,
electrical, sewage, or specialized lines) can be hazardous
or embarrassing when broken. Usually the utility or
owners will locate their lines.
Field checking.—Field checking by both mapper and
independent reviewer is a critical part of the mapping
process. Field checking after a map is complete allows
the mapper to check the interpretations at a given
location with the geologic concepts developed on the map
as a whole. Field checking by the independent reviewer
ensures that the basic field data are correct and conform
to project standards. Periodic field checking of pre-
viously mapped areas can be useful as the mapper's
concept of the site geology changes with the addition of
new surface and subsurface data.
152
MAPPING
Site Mapping
Engineering geologic mapping has two phases—mapping
prior to construction and mapping during construction.
In general, the following guidelines are for: (1) general
mapping requirements, (2) suggested equipment, (3) spe-
cific preparations needed for the job, (4) type of documen-
tation needed, and (5) special considerations that the
mapping may require.
General
Detailed site geologic mapping studies generally are done
for most structures or sites. Site mapping requirements
are controlled by numerous factors, the most important
of which are the type and size of structure to be built or
rehabilitated or site to be remediated, the phase of study
(planning through operation and maintenance), and the
specific design needs.
Site mapping studies for major engineering features
should be performed within an approximate 5-mile (8-
km) radius of the feature, with smaller areas mapped for
less critical structures. These studies consist of detailed
mapping and a study of the immediate site, with more
generalized studies of the surrounding area. This
approach allows an integration of the detailed site
geology with the regional geology. The overall process of
site mapping is a progression from preliminary, highly
interpretive concepts based on limited data to final
concepts based on detailed, reasonably well-defined data
and interpretation. This progression builds on each pre-
vious step using more detailed methods of data collection
to acquire better defined geologic information. Typically,
site mapping is performed in two phases:
(1) preliminary surface geologic mapping and (2) detailed
surface geologic mapping. All site mapping studies begin
153
FIELD MANUAL
with preparation of a preliminary surface geologic map
which delineates surficial deposits and existing bedrock
exposures. The preliminary surface geologic map is then
used to select sites for dozer trenches, backhoe trenches,
and drill holes. Surface geologic maps are then re-
interpreted based on the detailed surface and subsurface
data. If required, detailed subsurface geologic data are
also obtained from exploratory shafts and adits.
Suggested Equipment
The following list of basic equipment should meet most
needs. Not all listed equipment is necessary for every
project, but a Brunton Compass, geologist’s pick, (2-
pound hammer may be necessary for rock sampling),
maps, map board, aerial photographs, notebook, scale,
tape measure, protractor, knife, hand lens, various pens
and pencils, and a GPS should meet most needs.
Preparation
Whether a site mapping program is completed in one
field season or over several years, the overall project
schedule and budget are critical. A critical assessment
should be made of the time available for the mapping
program, the skills and availability of personnel to
accomplish the work, weather conditions, and budget
constraints.
Documentation
Site data are documented on drawings (and associated
notes) generated during the study. The drawings fall
into two general categories—working drawings and final
drawings. Working drawings serve as tools to evaluate
and analyze data as it is collected and to define areas
where additional data are needed. Analysis of data in a
three-dimensional format is the only way the geologist
154
MAPPING
can understand the site geology. Drawings should be
generated early in the study and continuously updated
as the work progresses. These drawings are used for
pre-liminary data transmittals. Scales used for working
drawings may permit more detailed descriptions and
collection of data that are not as significant to the final
drawings. Final drawings are generated late in the
mapping program, after the basic geology is well
understood. Many times new maps and cross sections
are generated to illustrate specific data that were not
available or well understood when the working drawings
were made. Final drawings serve as a record of the
investigations for special studies, specifications, or
technical record reports.
Preliminary Surface Geologic Mapping.—The
purpose of preliminary surface geologic mapping is to
define the major geologic units and structures in the site
area and the general engineering properties of the units.
Suggested basic geologic maps are a regional recon-
naissance map at scales between 1 inch = 2,000 feet and
1 inch = 5,280 feet (1:24,000 to 1:62,500), and a site
geology map at scales between 1 inch = 20 feet and 1
inch = 1,000 feet (1:250 to 1:12,000). Scale selection
depends on the size of the engineered structure and the
complexity of the geology. Maps of smaller areas may be
generated at scales larger than the base map to
illustrate critical conditions. Cross sections should be
made at a natural scale (equal horizontal and vertical) as
the base maps unless specific data are better illustrated
at an exaggerated scale. Exaggerated scale cross
sections are generally not suited for geologic analysis
because the distortion makes projection and
interpretation of geologic data difficult.
Initial studies generally are a reconnaissance-level effort,
and the time available to do the work usually is limited.
155
FIELD MANUAL
Initially, previous geologic studies in the general site
area are used. These studies should be reviewed and
field checked for adequacy and new data added. Initial
base maps usually are generated from existing
topographic maps, but because most readily available
topography is unsuitable for detailed studies, site
topography at a suitable scale should be obtained if
possible. Existing aerial photographs can be used as
temporary base maps if topographic maps are not
available. Sketch maps and Brunton/tape surveys or
GPS location of surface geologic data can be done if
survey accuracy or control is not available or necessary.
Good notes and records of outcrop locations and data are
important to minimize re-examination of previously
mapped areas. Aerial photo-graphy is useful at this
stage in the investigation, as photos can be studied in
the office for additional data. Only after reasonably
accurate surface geology maps have been compiled can
other investigative techniques, such as trenching and
core drilling, be used to full advantage. For some levels
of study, this phase may be all that is required.
Detailed Surface Geologic Mapping.— The purpose
of detailed surface geologic mapping is to define the
regional geology and site geology in sufficient detail so
geologic questions critical to the structure can be
answered and addressed. Specific geologic features
critical to this assessment are identified and studied,
and detailed descriptions of the engineering properties of
the site geologic units are compiled. Project
nomenclature should be systematized and standard
definitions used. Suggested basic geologic maps are
similar to those for preliminary studies, although
drawing scales may be changed based on the results of
the initial mapping program. Maps of smaller areas may
be generated to illustrate critical data at scales larger
than the base map.
156
MAPPING
The preliminary surface geology maps are used to select
sites for dozer trenches, backhoe trenches, and drill core
holes. As the surface geology is better defined, drill hole
locations can be selected to help clarify multiple geologic
problems. Detailed topography of the study site should
be obtained, if not obtained during the initial
investigations. Data collected during the preliminary
investigations should be transferred to the new base
maps, if possible, to save drafting time. Field mapping
control is provided primarily by the detailed topographic
maps and/or GPS, supplemented by survey control if
available or Brunton/ tape survey. If not, large scale
aerial photographs of a site area flown to obtain detailed
topography are useful in geologic mapping.
Dozer Trench Mapping
General
Dozer trenches are cut to expose rock or unconsolidated
materials below the surface and major surface creep.
Walls normally should be excavated vertically, free of
narrow benches and loose debris. Upon completion of
excavation, floors must be cleaned below any depth of
ripping, loose rubble should be removed, and a new
surface exposed. Structures such as contacts and shear
zones must be traceable from wall into floor for optimum
determination of their nature and attitude. The
geologist is responsible to ensure the dozer operator
produces a safe finished trench that meets Reclamation
and Occupational Safety and Health Administration
(OSHA) safety standards. If livestock are present,
fencing of the trench with four strands of barbed wire
may be required. After trench logging is completed,
decide whether to leave the trench open or to backfill. At
sites with complex geology, it is desirable to leave the
157
FIELD MANUAL
trench open for reinterpretation of the trench in light of
newly acquired data. Backfilling of the dozer trench may
be necessary where an open trench would be a safety
hazard. Generally, all trenches should be backfilled and
com-pacted prior to abandonment.
Suggested Equipment
Additional equipment needed may include hard hat,
scraper or putty knife, square-nosed shovel, plastic
flagging, nails, wooden stakes, surveyors chain or tape
measure (feet or meters) and log book. Use putty knife,
shovel, and whisk broom for cleaning trench exposures
and a Brunton tripod for more accurate trench bearings.
Preparation
Prior to working in a dozer trench, the geologist should
inspect the excavation trench walls for failure planes
(obvious or incipient) or loose materials. These should be
removed before mapping starts. An examination of the
whole trench should be made at the start of each work
period. A baseline should be laid out along the toe of the
trench wall or at the top of the excavation. Because
dozer trenches often are not straight, the trench should
be divided into a series of straight segments with
stations established at each point where the trench
changes direction. Each station should be marked by a
stake, tied with flagging, and marked with the trench
number and station letter (e.g., DT-12A). Flagging
strips should be nailed to the wall approximately 6 feet
(2 meters [m]) vertically above or below the station for
another reference point in case minor sloughing buries or
dislodges the stake.
158
MAPPING
Documentation
The scale and format selected for logging a backhoe
trench depends on the type of data needed and the
amount of detail to be illustrated. Typical dozer trench
log scales are between 1 inch (in) = 5 feet (ft) (1:100) and
1 in = 10 ft (1 : 200), but scales of 1 in = 1 ft (1: 50) may
be required in critical areas to adequately show
structural and stratigraphic details. If trench geology is
not complex, record trench logs, along with names of the
field party and date in a field book. Determine and
record the bearing, slope distance, and slope angle
between each station. Survey the coordinates and
elevations of each station. Orient the log book so the
sketch and description may be viewed together (see
figure 6-2). Sketch the walls and floors across the top
page of the open log book. Mark the baseline at 5-foot
(1.5-m) intervals and draw a single "hinge line”; wall
above, floor below. Determine the vertical heights of the
trench walls at each station and between stations, if the
profile or thickness of surficial materials changes
between stations.
Sketches should be accurate and illustrate the field
relationship of soil and geologic units and structures.
Use nails and flagging strips to mark obscure contacts or
other features for ready reference during logging.
Designate geologic units by name and symbol. Accurately
plot the attitude of contacts, bedding, foliation or
cleavage, faults, shear zones, and joints where they are
determined using standard symbols, and write a
description. If attitudes are determined from the wall,
they may be projected along strike into the floor, if no
change is apparent in the floor. Note and show the
bedding or foliation wherever relationships are complex
and differ from the recorded attitude (i.e., where surface
creep, drag folds, or disturbed zones are exposed in the
wall). Record unit attitudes that may have been
affected

MAPPING
by surface creep or slumping. Written descriptions of
soil and rock units and structural zones should be
restricted to the page below the sketch and should not
be written over the sketch. Main heading for written
descriptions are restricted to mappable geologic units.
Intervals are noted where the contacts intersect the
baseline. Indent subheadings within text to describe
lithologic or structural variations within the mappable
unit. An example of heading order is as follows:
DT-58, Sta. B-C, Distance - 27.5', Bearing - S. 45E

Slope + 2
22.5-50.0': Metasediments (description)
39.9-41.0': Chlorite Schist B (description)
47.5-49.0': Talc Schist (description)
48.2-48.4': Shear Zone (description)
Stratigraphic units should be colored to complete the log.
Photograph the trench to complement the log or to record
specific details within the trench.
Backhoe Trench Mapping
General
Backhoe trenches are excavated to expose rock or
unconsolidated materials below surficial deposits and
major surface creep. Generally, backhoe trenches are
excavated at sites which must be returned to near-
original conditions and where dozer trenching would
produce unacceptable damage. Backhoe trenches often
are excavated in the floor of an existing dozer trench to
deepen the excavation. Walls should be excavated
vertically and free of narrow benches and loose debris.
In most cases, the trench should be about 3 to 3-1/2 feet
wide (1 m) (width of standard backhoe bucket), 10 to 12
161
FIELD MANUAL
feet (3 to 3.6 m) deep, and slope at one end for easy
access. Upon excavation completion, hydraulic trench
shores are placed and pressurized or wooden shores
constructed to support the trench walls. Shore
construction and spacing must meet OSHA standards
and standards outlined in Reclamation's Construction
Safety and Health Standards manual. At no time should
personnel enter unshored portions of the trench over
5 feet deep. The geologist who oversees the excavation
of the backhoe trench is respon-sible for the construction
of a safe, stable trench.
After trench logging is completed, decide whether to
leave the trench open or to backfill. At sites with
complex geology, leave the trench open, if possible, as
this allows reinterpretation of the trench in light of
newly acquired data. However, backhoe trenches are
prone to sloughing with time, even when supported, and
backfilling of the trench may be necessary for safety
reasons. The coordi-nates and elevation of each end of
the backhoe trench should be surveyed prior to
backfilling.
Suggested Equipment
Standard field equipment is used during backhoe trench
mapping. Additional equipment may include a hard hat,
large knife, flat-blade pick or army trenching tool to
clean off trench walls, putty knife, whisk broom, nails,
flagging, twine, small string level, 100-foot (30-m) long
surveyor's chain or tape, and map board or log book. The
type of backhoe needed depends on how consolidated or
cemented the material is, site accessibility, and depth to
be excavated. Most of the larger, rubber-tired backhoes
are suitable for excavation of typical trenches, but well
consolidated or cemented material, steep site terrain, or
trench depths over about 12 feet (3.6 m) may require a
larger track-mounted hydraulic excavator.
162
MAPPING
Preparation
Each day prior to working in a backhoe trench, the
trench along both sides and the trench walls should be
examined for incipient fractures or loose materials,
particularly within the surficial materials. These loose
materials should be removed before work starts.
Hydraulic trench shores should be checked visually for
leakage and for loss of pressure by pushing on them with
a foot. Re-pressure any loose shores and replace leaking
shores. The stability of each shore should be checked
before the mapper's weight is put on it, particularly if
the shore is to be used to examine the upper trench wall
or to climb out of the trench.
A backhoe trench must be cleaned prior to logging.
During excavation, the backhoe bucket may smear clay
and silt along the walls, obscuring structural and strati-
graphic relationships. This smeared zone may be any-
where from a fraction of an inch thick to several inches
thick, depending on the amount of fines and moisture in
the material excavated. The smeared material can be
removed by chipping or scraping with a large knife, flat-
bladed pick, or army trenching tool. If the trench is
excavated in reasonably consolidated material and the
trench is free draining, a high pressure water and/or air
jet will remove this material. Both walls should be spot
cleaned and examined prior to major cleaning to deter-
mine which wall exposes the best geologic data. Usually
only one wall is completely cleaned; the other wall is spot
cleaned during trench logging to expose another view of
critical features or relationships. After a wall is cleaned,
a horizontal base line is established. The baseline is run
at about eye level and constructed by stringing twine
between nails driven into the cleaned trench wall. The
twine can be leveled using a small string level (available
in most hardware stores) prior to driving nails. When
the baseline becomes either too high or too low for
163
FIELD MANUAL
comfort-able measurements, a vertical offset of the string
line is made and the baseline continued at the new
horizon. In complex, critical areas where accurately
located contacts are needed, a string grid with horizontal
and vertical elements can be constructed off the baseline
to assist in mapping.
Documentation
The scale and format selected for logging a backhoe
trench depends on the type of data needed and the
amount of detail to be illustrated. Typical backhoe
trench log scales are between 1 in = 5 ft (1:100) and 1 in
= 10 ft (1 : 200), but scales of 1 in = 1 ft (1 : 50) may be
required in critical areas to adequately show structural
and stratigraphic details. If trench geology is not
complex, a notebook is suggested. The log book should
be oriented so the sketch and description may be viewed
together. The names of the field party, date, trench
number, location, and other pertinent data should be
recorded. If trench geology is complex and a larger scale
is desired, cut sheets of grid paper attached to a map
board may be used. These sheets are usually redrafted
after trench logging is completed. If the backhoe trench
is wet or wall material is sloughing down onto the map
board, a blank grid sheet can be taped to the map board
and overlain by sheets of mylar. Trench data sketched
onto the mylar will not be smeared as easily, and the
sheets can be erased without tearing. Prints of the
sheets can be made for use in preliminary data
transmittal or as check prints for field checking. Figure
6-3 shows a completed trench log.
Because the log sheets are separated easily, each sheet
should be marked with the names of the field party,
date, trench number, location, and other pertinent data.

MAPPING
Figure 6-3.—Sample completed trench log.
FIELD MANUAL
Begin trench logging by recording the trench bearing.
Begin at one end of the trench; place a surveyors chain
or tape along the horizontal base line string. Vertical
distance of the trench wall above and below the base line
should be measured every 10 feet (3 m) or so and the
trench outlines sketched. Sketches must be as accurate
as possible to illustrate the field relationships of soil,
geologic units, and structures. Use flagging to mark
obscure contacts or other features for easier logging.
Intervals for the various geologic units and features are
to be noted where the contacts intersect the baseline.
Contacts above and below the baseline are located by two
measurements—the vertical distance from the baseline
and baseline distance—and sketched onto the log.
Geologic units should be designated by name or symbol.
Symbols to illustrate the attitude of contacts, bedding,
fol-iation or cleavage, faults, shear zones, and joints
should be drawn at the point where determined and also
re-corded in the written description. Bedding or foliation
should be depicted and noted wherever relationships are
complex and differ from the recorded attitude (i.e., where
surface creep, drag folds, or disturbed zones are exposed
in the wall). Attitudes on units that may have been
affected by surface creep or slumping should also be so
noted.
Written descriptions of soil and rock units and structural
zones should be restricted to the area below the sketch.
Main headings for written descriptions are restricted to
mappable geologic units. Description format is similar
to that discussed for dozer trench mapping. After trench
logging is completed, geologic units should be colored to
complete the log and the trench field checked. Photo-
graph the trench to complement the trench log or to
record specific details within the trench. The limited
space and poor lighting conditions in a backhoe trench
166
MAPPING
many times make it difficult to obtain satisfactory
photos. Generally, cameras capable of closeup focusing
and loaded with fast film work best. Photographs taken
while standing at the top of the trench generally are
marginal because of poor lighting and perspective. The
ends of the trench should be located by GPS or survey.
Construction Geologic Mapping
Geologic mapping during construction is to: (1) identify
and delineate potential or actual construction-related
needs and problems; (2) verify and better define geologic
interpretations made during design studies, particularly
for critical geologic features and properties;
(3) determine if the geologic conditions are as interpreted
during the design phase and ensure that the actual
conditions revealed are as interpreted. If those
conditions are not as interpreted, design modifications
may be required; and (4) provide a record of as-built
conditions in the event of litigation or operational
problems.
To obtain meaningful data for mapping during con-
struction, cooperation and coordination between the
Contractor and the construction staff is required. The
field geologist prioritizes mapping; and when the specific
area is ready for mapping and approval, the staff and
surveyors (if required) should accomplish the work as
quickly as possible. Photographs should be taken using
appropriate photographic equipment. All photographs
should be captioned and dated.
Possible safety hazards that might occur during mapping
should be evaluated, and appropriate precautions should
be taken.
167
FIELD MANUAL
Large Excavation Mapping
General
Construction considerations prepared before construction
begins should contain guidelines for the mapping of spe-
cific features. The scope and detail of mapping required
at each portion of the site should be determined and
suitable mapping scales determined. Suggested scales
for detailed foundation mapping are 1 in = 5 ft to 1 in =
50 ft (1:50 to 1: 600), generalized foundation invert map
scale 1 in = 20 ft to 1 in = 100 ft (1:20 to 1:1,000).
Detailed, as-built foundation geology maps are used in
final design modification, as a final record, and for use in
possible future operation and maintenance problems.
Mapping can be done on detailed topographic base maps
generated from survey control, GPS, or plane table.
Preferably, geology points are flagged and surveyed by a
survey crew. Terrestrial photography, photogrammetry,
and GPS can also be used to supplement mapping.
Detailed photo-graphy of the entire foundation is
important for inclusion in the final construction geology
report and as a part of the construction record. Use
standard nomenclature and symbols both on maps and
photographs, but be consistent with those used in earlier
studies and specifications. Use a systematic method of
collecting mapping data, then compile these data into a
useful and accurate geologic map.
Detailed, as-built geology maps of cutslopes are required
in delineating and solving major slope stability problems
and in selecting general slope support systems. Recom-
mended scale selection for detailed cut-slope geology
maps are 1 inch = 10 feet to 1 inch = 50 feet (1:100 to
1:600), generalized cutslope geology maps use a scale
1 inch = 20 feet to 1 inch = 100 feet (1:200 to 1:1,000).
Generally, maps are on detailed topographic base maps
168
MAPPING
generated from survey control. Geologic points may be
flagged for survey by survey crews. Detailed
photographs of the slopes are important.
Steep Slope Mapping
General
Define the purpose and goal for mapping and research
the stratigraphy and structural geology prior to starting.
Select scaling and safety equipment for specific areas.
Preparation
Special training is required for scaling. While scaling
and mapping, a pocket tape recorder and camera are
useful for documentation.
Suggested Equipment
Use the appropriate scaling equipment and systems.
Standard mapping equipment needs to be reviewed and
modified for scaling operations.
Documentation
Establish ground control for mapping including ter-
restrial photo mapping. Data collected while scaling
should be based on the purpose of mapping and detail
required. Establish general map controls such as grid
controls.
Special Considerations
Select specific portions of an exposure to be mapped.
169
FIELD MANUAL
Canal and Pipeline Mapping
General
In reconnaissance investigations, surface geologic map-
ping is used to determine the most feasible alignment,
which may be representative of the geologic conditions to
be encountered, the lining requirements, and
construction materials available. Design data
investigations along canal alignments must be detailed
enough to determine the final alignment and all
associated requirements for specifications and
construction.
Preconstruction investigations for canals and pipelines
are less detailed because of the long distances involved.
Consequently, geologic construction mapping is
necessary to verify preconstruction assumptions,
document changes from original assumptions, and
provide data for potential design changes or claim
analyses.
Preparation
General field mapping requirements.
Documentation
Pertinent geologic data that should be shown on the base
maps include: soil and geologic units, all natural and
manmade exposures, geologic structures, springs and
seepage, surface channels, and potentially unstable
areas. Where appropriate, photographs with overlays or
detailed site-specific drawings should be used to show
surface conditions in relation to the canal prism or
associated canal structures. Base maps should be plan
strip topo-graphy or orthophotography with scales of 1 in
= 20 ft (1:400) to 1 in = 100 ft (1:2,000) with associated
topographic profiles.
170
MAPPING
Underground Geologic Mapping
General
This is a general guide for recording tunnel geology and
describes mapping requirements and procedures. This
guide and the field geologist's judgement and experience
should permit development of geologic data which
adequately document geologic factors that are significant
to design, construction, and stability of tunnels and
shafts. Some of the necessary data may be obtained
from other project personnel such as engineers,
surveyors, and inspectors. The following items are of
primary impor-tance during the construction or
exploration for a wide range of tunnel and shaft types,
excavation problems, geologic conditions, and contract
administration require-ments. The data recorded and
the emphasis given each item should be determined for
each specific tunnel. (Note: references to tunnels apply
equally to shafts)
Three principal objectives are to:
• Acquire progressive, timely mapping of all
significant geologic features as exposed during the
advance of the tunnel or shaft. These initial fea-
tures are important for subsequent identification of
changes which may take place, such as water flow,
rock slaking, or support behavior, as the heading
progresses and before lining or other completion
measures are undertaken.
• Facilitate periodic transmittal of these data in pre-
liminary form to the office so that conditions being
encountered and their effect on the excavation can
be used in immediate evaluation of current
construction activities and anticipation of future
excavation conditions.
171
FIELD MANUAL
• Assure that a systematic, clear, record of geologic
conditions is compiled for design reviews and use by
the project and contractor. These data should be
included in the final construction geology report.
These records may prove invaluable during subse-
quent operation and maintenance and in the
planning and design of future tunnels and shafts. If
geologically related problems occur, these data will
be essential in evaluating the conditions.
Accuracy is essential, and consistency of data shown on
tunnel maps is vital. If the maps are used in contract
claim negotiations or in litigation, even a few errors or
inconsistencies may compromise the entire map.
The preparation of an adequate tunnel or shaft geologic
map requires a careful study of geologic structure, lith-
ology, mineralogy, groundwater, and their effects on rock
quality and behavior, tunneling methods, stability, and
support. The preparation of a tunnel or shaft geologic
map is a geologic mapping process; geologic data should
be recorded directly on the map while making the obser-
vations and not described in notes for subsequent
drafting in the office. An appropriately scaled tunnel or
shaft mapping form, prepared prior to starting the
mapping, is essential to systematic data collection. One-
matte-sided mylar tunnel forms should be used in wet
excavations and are recommended as a standard for all
tunnel and shaft mapping. Figures 6-4 and 6-5 are
examples of field mapping forms. The use of mylars in
all tunnels facili-tates copying and immediate use. The
extent or amount of mapping detail for a specific tunnel
or shaft will depend on the driving method, geologic
conditions, and design considerations. For example,
tunnel face (head-ing) maps can be obtained under most
conditions when conventional excavation (drill/blast)
methods are used but are difficult to obtain in tunnels
excavated by tunnel

more difficult to map than conventionally excavated

machine configuration, and the support method.
However, the key rock characteristics relative to tunnel
stability must be mapped. In tunnels where shotcrete or
precast segments are used for support, detailed mapping
may be impossible; this does not cancel the requirement
for mapping and recording of important data on the
geologic conditions. The geologist must obtain required
data with the available resources and under the specific
conditions. These guidelines apply to all tunnel or shaft
excavations regardless of whether the mapping is
performed during project planning, design data acqui-
sition, or construction.
Safety
Underground construction activities are inherently more
hazardous than surface construction. Before working
underground, the specific safety requirements for the
particular tunnel should be determined. Self-rescuer
training commonly is required, and the safety require-
ments as described in the Reclamation Safety and Health
Standards [5] should be reviewed. Additional training or
additional requirements may exist under special
circumstances such as gassy conditions. Before
beginning work, a familiarization tour of the work site
(including the underground workings) should be made
with project personnel, such as an inspector, intimately
familiar with the job. Also, assume that every piece of
equipment and worker is out to get you; you should
always maintain an awareness of what the workers and
equipment are doing around you.
175
FIELD MANUAL
General Preparation
Tunnel construction is essentially a linear activity. All
access, equipment haulage, and work activities take
place in a line. The mapping process should be planned
such that a minimum number of trips to the heading are
required and a minimum amount of time is spent at the
heading. Geologic mapping can usually be integrated
into an optimum part of the construction cycle.
Unnecessarily spending time at the heading is not only
inefficient but can interfere with the construction
process by adding to an already congested situation.
Available geologic data should be reviewed and
established nomenclature used as appropriate. Geologic
features described in the available literature should be
specifically investigated while mapping, especially those
described in specifications documents. Forms should be
designed to expedite the work as much as possible
(figures 6-4 and 6-5), required mapping equipment must
be available, and the construction cycle should be ana-
lyzed to determine the best and safest time to map.
Tunnel map sheets should be a convenient size such as
8.5 x 11 inches (A4) or 11 x 18 inches (A3). This permits
100 feet (30 m) of tunnel on a scale of 1 inch = 10 feet
(1:200) with sufficient space for concise explanations and
a title block. The geology should be mapped in the
tunnel directly on the matt side of mylar film. This map,
developed in the tunnel, can be edited and copied for
quick transmittal to the office. The value of current data
cannot be overemphasized. Except under very special
conditions, the recording of geologic data in a notebook
without mapping for subsequent preparation of a graphic
tunnel map is unacceptable. Without a graphic
represen-tation during data acquisition, the
interrelationships of geologic data cannot be properly
evaluated, and data are missed or errors are introduced.
Some items listed above will not apply to every tunnel,
176
MAPPING
and some items may be shown more appropriately in a
summary tunnel map (figure 6-6). This map presents a
summary of essential engineering and geologic
relationships. Plotting engi-neering and geologic data as
a time line permits direct comparison of geologic
conditions, supports installed, overbreak, excavation
rate, etc., for correlation. Sum-mary sheet scales may
range from 1 inch = 10 to 100 feet (1:100 to 1:1,000)
depending on amount of data and complexity of the
geology. Ongoing maintenance of these data avoids
excessive compilation time after construction is
completed. A summary tunnel map is required on
tunnels for construction records.
When several individuals are mapping and/or contract
requirements hinge on geologic data, e.g., payment based
on ground classification, a project or specific mapping
manual may be necessary. A manual provides an easy
reference for data requirements and format, reduces
inconsistency between geologists, and sets a specific
mapping standard.
Excavation Configuration
Conventionally excavated tunnels are usually a modified
horseshoe shape. Departures from this shape are
usually for a special configuration or when ground
conditions
dictate a circular shape for optimizing support effective-
ness. Machine-excavated tunnels are round if bored
unless a road-header type machine is used. Road-header
excavated tunnels are usually horseshoe shaped for con-
struction convenience. Shafts are almost always round
for optimizing support effectiveness and because most
are drilled or bored either from the surface or raise-bored
from the bottom. Exploratory shafts may be sunk
conven-tionally if shallow. Whatever the shape, the map
format should be designed to minimize the amount of
projection
177
FIELD MANUAL
and interpretation required. Whenever possible, the full
periphery mapping method should be employed.
Data Requirements
The relationship of the geology to the engineering
aspects of the tunnel or shaft is of primary importance.
If geologi-cally related problems occur, the recorded data
will be valuable to the geologist and engineer in
evaluating the conditions, the cause(s), and in devising
remedial measures. In most cases, geologic
discontinuities, such as joints, faults, bedding, etc., are
the most important factors affecting excavation stability;
and these data are of primary importance. Also, the rock
strength is important in high cover tunnels, and water is
important in many situations. The following data are
most important:
1. Rock Classification.— Lithology and related
features such as foliation, schistosity, and flow structure.
Rock descriptions should be concise; use standard
descriptors.
• Formation boundaries — describe bedding
thick-ness and attitude, areas of soft, or unstable
rock. Give dip and strike unless otherwise noted.
Dips of planes (not necessarily true dip) into tunnel
are desirable in cases where they may influence
excavation stability.
• Physical properties of the rock — determine
hardness by comparison with common or familiar
materials, brittleness, reaction to pick or knife, and
color.
• Alteration — describe degree, type, extent, and
effects on construction. Differentiate between wea-
thering, other alteration, and cementation.
178
179
MAPPING

FIELD MANUAL
180
MAPPING
• Features — describe the size, form (tabular,
irregular), contacts (sharp, gradational, sheared),
and mineralization, if any.
2. Conditions Which Affect Stability of the Rock.—
• Joints or joint systems — describe spacing,
conti-nuity, length, whether open or tight,
slickensides, planarity, waviness, cementation,
fillings, dip and strike, and water.
• Shear zones — describe severity of shearing and
physical condition of rock in and adjacent to the
zone, whether material is crushed or composed of
breccia, gouge, or mylonite; describe gouge
thickness, physi-cal properties, mineralogy and
alteration; dip and strike, and water.
• Faults — give dimensions of fault breccia and/or
gouge and adjacent disturbed or fractured zones,
amount of displacement, if determinable, and the
fault's effect on stability of rock.
3. Effects of Tunneling on Rock.— Comment on: the
condition of rock after excavation, rate of air slaking or
other deterioration of rock where appropriate, rock
bursts, fallouts, development of squeezing or heavy
ground, and time interval between first exposure and the
beginning of these effects. Include the evidence used in
evaluation, and the reaction of different rock types to
conventional blasting or mechanical excavation method.
Periodic re-examination of the tunnel and comparison of
originally mapped conditions with those existing later is
recommended.
181
FIELD MANUAL
4. Tunnel Excavation Methods.—
Blast pattern — Give example of typical blast round
pattern, type of explosive and quantity per yard
(powder factor) of rock blasted, size of rock fragments,
ease or difficulty of rock breakage and condition of the
walls of the tunnel such as whether half-rounds (half
of peripheral shot holes) are visible. Some of this
infor-mation should be obtainable from the inspectors.
Overbreak — Overbreak and fallout should be mea-
sured as a peripheral average from "B" line (excavation
pay line), where practical, and maximum at specific
stations. Plot average overbreak on the section along
tunnel alignment. Relate this to geologic conditions
and construction methods, particularly blasting
procedure.
Ground behavior — Blockiness, caving, swelling,
and/ or squeezing should be described with evidence
and effects.
Supports — Give size and spacing of ribs, size and
types of struts, and behavior of supports in reaches of
bad ground. Where supports show distress or have
failed, give reason for failure, time after installation
for load to develop, the remedial measures
undertaken, and size and spacing of replaced supports
or jump sets. If a ground classification system is being
used, relate to geologic conditions and support used.
Incorporate some reference to the actual need for
support versus that installed. Use the proper
terminology when describing supports. A good
reference for tunnel supports (and conventional
tunneling) is Rock Tunneling with Steel Supports [6].
182
MAPPING
Indicate where special supports such as mats, spiling,
or breast boards are required and geologic reason.
Where rock bolts (or split sets) are used, give spacing,
size, length, type, anchor type, torque loading values,
and quantities used. Note retorquing, if performed.
Locations of rock bolts should be plotted on the
geologic maps.
Machine excavation — In machine-type excavations
(in addition to appropriate items above) give: rate of
advance, pressures used, and description of cuttings or
rock breakage. Describe the effect of cutters and
grippers on rock walls, or other geologically related
problems such as abrasive rock wearing cutters.
5. Hydrogeology .—Water flows should be mapped and
quantities estimated. Daily heading and portal measure-
ments should be recorded. The location of all significant
flows should be plotted on the tunnel map and changes
in rate or duration of flow recorded. If the water is
highly mineralized, obtain chemical analyses of water for
pos-sible effect on concrete or steel linings or
contamination of water being discharged or to be
conveyed by the tunnel.
6. Gas.—The following should be done:
• Determine type, quantity, occurrence, geologic asso-
ciations, and points of discharge should be mapped.
• Samples should be taken. This is usually done by
safety personnel.
• Record actions taken.
7. Instrumentation, Special Tests, Grout, and
Feeler Holes.—Locations and logs (if available) should
be shown on the tunnel maps.
183
FIELD MANUAL
8. Miscellaneous Excavations.—Geologic maps and
sections of related excavations such as surge tanks, gate
shafts, inlet and outlet portal open cuts are necessary.
Tunnel maps should include brief comments on the
geologic conditions being encountered and their possible
effects.
9. Sampling.—A systematic sampling program of the
tunnel rock is essential to adequately record tunnel
geology. These samples may be 2 in x 3 in (5 cm x 8 cm)
or larger and should be secured in a labeled sample bag
showing station, date, and wall position with an
appropriate description. Rock that easily deteriorates
should be protected with wax or plastic. Sampling at
irregular (and locally close) intervals may be required to
ensure that all important rock, geologic, and physical
conditions are adequately represented. A representative
stratigraphic series of samples should be collected. The
judgement of the geologist who is familiar with the
geology is the best guide in determining the most
appropriate sampling interval.
Thorough photographic coverage provides a visual record
of construction and geologic conditions. Postconstruction
evaluations use construction photographs extensively
and are an important part of the construction record. A
camera should be part of the mapping equipment and
routinely used. Photographs that show typical, as well
as atypical, geologic conditions should be taken
routinely. Identify photographs of significant features by
number on the appropriate map sheet.
184
MAPPING
Underground Geologic Mapping Methods
Full Periphery Mapping
The full periphery (or developed surface) mapping
method is widely used in engineering practice and
involves creating a map of the surface of the
underground excavation regardless of shape. The
method produces a map which is virtually free from
distortion and interpretation present in other methods
where geologic features are projected onto a plane or
section. The method has been used successfully in
various types and shapes of excavations (Hatheway,
1982 [7]; U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 1970 [8];
Proctor, 1971 [9]) and on numerous Reclamation
projects.
The method uses a developed surface created by
"unrolling" or "flattening out" the circumference of the
tunnel or shaft to form a "plan" of the entire wall surface
(figure 6-7). The geologic features are plotted on this
plan. The method is especially effective in that geologic
features of all types can be plotted directly onto the map
regardless of orientation or location with no projection
required. The method is useful for plotting curving or
irregular discontinuities which are difficult to project to
a flat plane as in other methods.
Procedure.—Full periphery mapping generally requires
the assembly of field sheets prior to the actual start of
mapping. This is done for drifts and tunnels by first
drawing in the crown centerline of the plan (figure 6-7).
The bases of the walls or the invert are then plotted at a
circumferential distance from the crown centerline on
the plan. For instance, if the tunnel is 10 feet (3.048 m)
in excavated diameter, the invert centerline will be
plotted 15.71 feet (4.79 m) (in scale) from the crown
centerline. Plot springline at the appropriate
circumferential
185
186
MAPPING
distance from the crown centerline. This process is done
for both walls and produces a plan which represents the
actual wall surface of the excavation. The map layout is
designed to be viewed from above the tunnel. Shaft data
are plotted as viewed from inside the excavation. The
tunnel invert is not mapped because rock surfaces
usually are covered with muck or invert segments. Plot
scales on either side of the plan to provide distance
control while mapping. A longitudinal section view of
the excavation may be added alongside the plan to
provide a space to record types and locations of support,
overbreak, etc. Plot geologic features on the field sheets
(figures 6-4 and 6-5) by noting where the features
intercept known lines, such as where a particular joint
intercepts the crown centerline, the spring line on both
walls, or the base of either wall. The trace of the joint is
sketched to scale between these known points. The
strike and dip of the discontinuity are recorded directly
on the field sheet adjacent to the trace. The locations of
samples, photographs, water seeps, and flows are plotted
on the map (figure 6-8).
The Brunton compass is used to measure dips on the
various discontinuities; but due to the presence of
support steel, rock bolts, utilities, and any natural
magnetism of the wall rock, a Brunton may not be
reliable for deter-mining the strike of the feature. In
this case, the strike may be determined by one of several
methods. The first method is to align the map parallel
to the tunnel where the feature is exposed in the wall
and plot the strike by eye on the sheet parallel to the
strike of the feature in the wall. The second method is
to observe the strike of the feature on the map where it
intersects the crown centerline. At this point, the crown
is essentially hori-zontal, and the trace of the feature at
this point represents the strike. The third method is
slightly more complex but is the most accurate method
of the three.
187
188
FIELD
MANUAL
Figure 6-8.—Full periphery geologic map example.
MAPPING
This method requires locating where the feature inter-
sects springline on each wall of the full periphery map.
These points are projected to the corrected springline. A
line drawn between the projected points represents the
strike of the feature. Note that these methods assume
that the tunnel or drift is relatively horizontal. In some
cases, if the excavation is inclined, the apparent strike
can be corrected for the amount of inclination. A fourth
method is to use a gyroscopic compass.
Other Applications.—With minor variations in the
method described above, the full periphery method can
be used equally well in vertical or inclined shafts,
horseshoe shaped drifts and tunnels, and other regular
shaped excavations.
Advantages.—The full periphery method:
• Involves plotting the actual traces of geologic
features as they are exposed in the tunnel. This
eliminates the distortion and interpretation introduced
by other methods where the traces are projected back
to a plane tangent to the tunnel.
• Allows the geologist to observe and plot irregu-
larities in geologic features and make accurate three-
dimensional interpretations of the features.
• Allows rapid and easy plotting of the locations of
samples and photographs.
• Allows easy and rapid recording of the locations of
rock bolts and other types of rock reinforcement.
189
FIELD MANUAL
Disadvantages.—
• Since the surface of the excavation is generally a
curved surface, the trace of planar features, such as
fractures, faults, and bedding planes, produce curves
when plotted on the map.
• The full periphery method requires that the points
at which features intersect springline be projected to
the original tunnel diameter in order to compute the
true strike of the discontinuity (figure 6-7).
Plan and Section
The plan and section method has been used in engi-
neering practice but has generally been replaced by the
full periphery mapping method. The plan and section
method is still used where data interpretation is
facilitated by the flat plan and sections. The method
creates vertical sections commonly coincident with a wall
or walls of a tunnel or shaft, through centerline, or is
tangent to a curving surface commonly at springline or
an edge of a shaft (figure 6-9). Geologic features are
projected to the sections and plotted as they are mapped.
The method produces a map which is a combination of
direct trace and projection or a projection of the walls
except where the map is tangent to the excavation
(figure 6-10). The plan through tunnel springline and
centerline or shaft centerline is a projection of the
geologic features exposed in the excavation.
Procedure.—The plan and section method generally
requires the assembly of field sheets prior to the actual
start of mapping. This is done for drifts and tunnels by
drawing vertical sections the height of the excavation.
190
MAPPING

geologic mapping.
191
FIELD MANUAL
Figure 6-10.—Relationship of planar feature trace to
map projections.
192
MAPPING
The bases of the walls or the invert form the base of the
section with springline plotted and the crown forming
the top of the section. For instance, if the tunnel is 20
feet (6 m) high, the crown will be 20 feet (6 m) from the
invert. Springline is plotted the appropriate vertical
distance from the crown or invert (figure 6-10). This
process may be done for one or both walls, producing one
or two vertical representations of the wall/arch exposure.
Shafts are similar, but the section corresponds to the
wall of a rectangular shaft or is tangent to the shaft wall
at a point, and the map is a projection of the shaft of one
diameter.
A section through tunnel springlines produces a plan
projection of the arch except at the plan intersection with
the wall at springline. The corresponding section
through a shaft produces a vertical projection of the
wall(s) through a shaft or along a diameter. The map
represents the actual wall surface of the excavation only
where the projection intersects the wall.
Scales are added on either side of the sections to provide
distance control while plotting. An additional longitu-
dinal section view of the excavation may be added to pro-
vide a space to record types and locations of support or
overbreak. Geologic features are then plotted on the
field sheets by noting where the features intercept
known lines, such as where a particular joint intercepts
the crown centerline, the spring line on both walls, or the
base of either wall. The trace of the joint is then pro-
jected to the section between these known points. The
attitudes of features are recorded on the field sheet adja-
cent to the trace. The location of samples, photographs,
water seeps, and flows can be recorded by finding their
location on the wall and projecting that location to the
map.
193
FIELD MANUAL
Advantages.—The plan and section method:
• Produces two-dimensional sections and plans that do
not require conversion. The sections and plans can be
integrated directly with other plans and sections. The
sections and plans are easily understood by individuals
not familiar with full periphery mapping or individuals
who have difficulty visualizing structural features in
three-dimensions.
• Permits direct determination of strikes by spring-
line intersections.
Disadvantages.—Since the surface of the excavation is
generally a curved surface, the trace of planar features,
such as fractures, faults, and bedding planes, are projec-
tions to a plane. The only objective data is where the
map is coincident or tangent to the excavation surface.
The plan and section method requires:
• Plotting and observing geologic features and making
accurate three-dimensional interpretations of the
features by projecting locations to a plane.
• Plotting locations of samples and photographs by
projection.
• Recording locations of rock bolts and other types of
rock reinforcement by projection.
• Plotting is done after data collection and re-
examination of the site is difficult or not practical.
194
MAPPING
Face Maps
The geology exposed in an excavation face is plotted
directly on a map. The purpose of the face map is to
provide a quick appraisal of rock conditions and provide
data for special detailed studies. The combination of
wall and face maps will usually give an adequate and
clear permanent record of any complex tunnel geology.
Natural scales such as 1 inch = 1 to 2 feet (1:50) are the
most satisfactory. All significant geologic features which
may affect the stability of the tunnel must be mapped.
Photogrammetric Mapping
Photogrammetric geologic mapping is a specialized
method consisting of the interpretation of close-range
stereophotography of excavation walls. Photogrammetric
control is provided by surveyed targets or by a gnomon or
scale in the photographs. The stereophotos are inter-
preted using photogrammetric software or an analytical
plotter. Feature location accuracy can vary from a few
inches (cm) to one-eighth of an inch (3mm) depending on
equipment and survey control accuracy. The photogram-
metric mapping can be combined with detail line surveys
for small-scale data collection and control.
Exploration Mapping Method Selection
The geologic mapping format for exploratory drifts and
shafts should be determined by data uses. Direct
integra-tion of excavation maps into composite maps of
a dam foundation is much easier if undistorted sections
are available. The maps can be treated in the same
manner as drill hole logs. The disadvantages of plan and
section mapping may be offset by the advantages of easy
inter-pretation and integration into other data bases.
195
FIELD MANUAL
Construction Mapping.—Full periphery geologic
mapping should be used for routine construction
activities. The advantages of increased speed and
accuracy in production mapping and the reduction of
interpretation offsets the disadvantages.
Summary
This guide to tunnel geologic mapping during construc-
tion has been developed for general use and serves to
standardize procedures and data collection. Items of
primary significance are included, but some are not
adaptable to all tunnels or methods of tunnel excavation.
The judgment of an experienced geologist is the best
guide to the specific items and amount of detail required
to provide pertinent, informative data. To ensure
reliable and useful tunnel geologic studies, all important
geology and related engineering construction data which
may be significant to tunnel construction as well as
in the planning, designing, and constructing of future
tunnels should be considered for inclusion in the tunnel
map and report.
Photogeologic Mapping
General
Aerial photographs generally are used in reconnaissance
geologic mapping, geologic field mapping, and in gener-
ation of photo-interpretive geologic maps. Various scales
of airphotos are valuable for regional and site studies, for
both detection and mapping of a wide variety of geologic
features important to engineering geology.
196
MAPPING
Types of Aerial Photographs
Panchromatic (Black and White).—Panchromatic
photography records images essentially across the entire
visible spectrum, and with proper film and filters also
can record into the near-infrared. In aerial photography,
blue is generally filtered out to reduce the effects of
atmospheric haze.
Natural Color.—Images are recorded in the natural
colors seen by the human eye in the visible portion of the
spectrum.
False-Color Infrared.—Images are recorded using part
of the visible spectrum and part of the near-infrared, but
the colors in the resultant photographs are not natural
(false-color). Infrared film is commonly used and is less
affected by haze than other types. False-color photo-
graphy is not the same as thermal-infrared imaging
which uses the thermal part of the infrared spectrum.
Multispectral.—Photographs acquired by multiple
cameras simultaneously recording different portions of
the spectrum can aid interpretation.
Photogrammetry and Equipment
Use stereoscopes to view aerial photographs for
maximum utility and ease of interpretation. Pocket
stereoscopes are useful in the field or office. Large
mirror stereoscopes are useful for viewing large
quantities of photos or photos in rolls. Know the photo
scale, resolution, and exaggeration. Be aware of the
types of distortions inherent in airphotos.
197
FIELD MANUAL
Compilation of Photogeologic Map Data
Mapping should be done on transparent one-side-matte
mylar overlays and not on the photographs. Any lines,
even if erased, can confuse later interpretations using
the photos. The mapping is then transferred to base
maps minimizing the effects of distortions in photos due
to the camera optics. Orthophoto quadrangles can help
reduce this distortion.
Analysis of Aerial Photographs
General Interpretive Factors
Analysis of aerial photographs involves interpreting
indirect data. In most cases, several factors are used to
interpret geologic conditions. Interpretive factors
usually used in the analysis of aerial photographs are:
Sun Angle.—High or low illumination angles may be
desired, depending on the nature of the features to be
detected.
Photographic Tone.—Variations in color, intensity,
shade and shadows.
Texture.—Frequency of change in tone, evident as
roughness, smoothness.
Color.—True and false-color imagery may be easier to
interpret than panchromatic photographs, depending on
features being observed. For some applications (e.g.,
low sun angle photography), panchromatic photography
is better.
198
MAPPING
Geomorphic Shape and Pattern.—Geologic conditions
can be identified by mapping various types of geomorphic
features related to drainage, bedding, and structure.
Vegetation.—Some types of vegetation and vegetal pat-
terns can assist in interpreting geology. Vegetation may
indicate depth of soil, type of soil, available moisture,
and type of bedrock.
Photoanalysis for Reconnaissance
Geologic Mapping
Photo-reconnaissance geologic mapping can be done to
produce a preliminary geologic map of the study area
prior to going into the field to check and verify the
interpreted geologic data or to produce a finished
geologic map with little or no field checking. These maps
are called photo-reconnaissance geologic maps and
photo-interpretive geologic maps, respectively.
Photo-Reconnaissance Geologic Mapping
Photo-analysis prior to field work allows the mapper to
form a preliminary concept of the geology of the study
area and to select areas for detailed examination. Prior
photo-analysis is critical if available field time is limited,
especially when a large area is involved, as in regional
studies, reservoir area mapping, and pipeline or canal
alignment studies.
Photo-Interpretive Geologic Mapping
Geologic maps produced solely from aerial photographs
with little or no field checking are useful when time,
funds, or access are limited or when adverse weather
prevents a more detailed field mapping program. The
199
FIELD MANUAL
limitations of this form of geologic map are dependent on
outcrop density and degree of exposure, amount of
vegetative cover, contrast of the geologic units, and the
skills of the photogeologic mapper. This type of map is
useful for preliminary or reconnaissance level
evaluations but should never be used for design level
work.
Photoanalysis During Geologic Field Mapping
The location and verification of geologic features in the
field can usually be expedited by using aerial photo-
graphs. Photographs often reveal landforms that are
difficult to see or interpret from the ground, such as
land-slides. Photographs can be used to clarify and
speed up field mapping by allowing a comprehensive
view of the study site and the relationships of the
various geologic features exposed. Alternately viewing
photos and exam-ining outcrops can greatly facilitate
mapping.
Availability of Imagery
Aerial photography is available, commonly in a variety of
scales and types, for essentially the entire conterminous
United States. The principal repositories of publicly
owned airphotos is the EROS Data Center, operated by
the U.S. Geological Survey and the Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS) of the
U.S. Department of Agriculture. The USGS has several
regional offices of the Earth Science Information Center
(ESIC). The ESIC operates the Aerial Photography
Summary Record System (APSRS), which is a standard
reference data base for users of aerial photographs. The
APSRS lists aerial photography available from a large
number of government agencies and commercial com-
panies. The lists are comprehensive and categorized by
state and by latitude and longitude. APSRS data are
200

available on request from ESIC. ESIC also provides
information about cartographic products other than
imagery.

Aerial Photography Flight Planning
If air photos are not available at the right scale, or of the
right type for an area, specific flights can be made.
Successful airphoto mission planning requires considera-
tion of several factors, including film type, scale, time of
day (sun-angle), time of year, and the size of the area to
be covered. Mission planning should not be done by
someone unfamiliar with the process without assistance.
Specifications should be written to ensure that the
result-ing photographs will be appropriate for the
201
FIELD MANUAL
intended purpose. Information critical to mission
planning is available from the references listed below.
Time and Cost Estimating
The cost of data acquisition is relatively easy to estimate.
The cost of interpretation is much harder to estimate,
being a function of the time required, which is related to
the size and complexity of the study area and the skill of
the interpreter. The cost of a single drill hole will pay
for a lot of aerial photography and interpretation.

DISCONTINUITY SURVEYS
General
Physical properties of discontinuities generally control
the engineering characteristics of a rock mass. Accurate
and thorough description of discontinuities is an integral
part of geological mapping conducted for design and
construction of civil structures. It is improbable that any
survey will provide complete information on all the
discontinuities at a site. However, properly conducted
surveys will furnish data with a high probability of
accurately representing the site discontinuities. This
chapter discusses discontinuity recording methodology.
These recording methods can be applied to outcrops, drill
holes, open excavations, and the perimeters of under-
ground openings. The evaluation of discontinuity data is
well described in the literature. For example, plotting
discontinuity data on stereograms, contouring to deter-
mine prominent orientations, and subsequent wedge
analyses are described in Rock Slope Engineering [1] and
Methods of Geological Engineering in Discontinuous Rock
and Introduction to Rock Mechanics [2,3]. “Chapter 5,
Terminology and Descriptions for Discontinuities,” lists
data that are typically recorded in discontinuity surveys.
It is extremely important that the actual discontinuity
descriptors and measurement units be selected to support
the anticipated rock mass classification system(s).
Acquiring incomplete or excessive data may limit data
usefulness in subsequent analyses, and result in
excessive costs due to repeating surveys or from collecting
more data than needed.
FIELD MANUAL
Empirical Methods for Rock Mass Classification
A number of empirical methods have been developed to
predict the stability of rock slopes and underground
openings in rock and to determine the support
requirements of such features. A method for estimating
steel-arch support requirements in tunnels was one of the
first [4], and various methods which address open-cut
excavations and existing rock slopes have been used
since. The Geomechanical Classification (Rock Mass
Rating [RMR]) [5,6] and the Norwegian Geotechnical
Institute (NGI) (Q-system Classification [Q]) [7] are com-
monly used. Both of these methods incorporate Rock
Quality Designation (RQD) [8]. Since both the RMR and
Q-system are based on actual case histories, both systems
can be somewhat dynamic, and refinements based on new
data are widely suggested. Additional information on
RQD, RMR, and the Q-system is provided in chapter 2.
Other predictive methods include the Rock Structure
Rating (RSR) [9] and the Unified Rock Classification
System (URCS) [10]. “Keyblock” analysis [11,12] is a
means of determining the most critical or “key” blocks of
rock formed by an excavation in jointed, competent rock.
An excellent single source of information on the various
classification systems is in American Society for Testing
Materials Special Technical Publication 984, Rock
Classification Systems for Engineering Purposes.
Data Collection
Discontinuity data can be collected using areal or detail
line survey methods. The areal method, which consists
of the spot recording of discontinuities in outcrops within
an area of interest, is of limited use in geotechnical
analyses. Areal surveys should be applied only for
preliminary scoping of a site or in cases where the lateral
206
DISCONTINUITY SURVEYS
extent of exposed rock is inadequate to perform detail line
surveys. The detail line survey (DLS) method (DLS or
line mapping) provides spacial control necessary to accu-
rately portray and analyze site discontinuities. DLS map-
ping was originally a method of mapping road cuts and
open pit excavations. DLS use has been expanded both in
scope and types of exposures mapped. Each geologic
feature that intercepts a usually linear traverse is
recorded. The traverse can be a 100-ft (30 m) tape placed
across an outcrop, the wall of a tunnel, a shaft wall at a
fixed elevation, or an oriented drill core. In all cases, the
alignment of the traverse and the location of both ends of
the traverse should be determined. The mapper moves
along the line and records everything, as noted in
chapter 5, or as needed to support analyses. Feature
locations are projected along strike to the tape, and the
distance is recorded. Regardless of the survey method,
the mapper must obtain a statistically significant number
of observations. A minimum of 60 discontinuity measure-
ments per rock type is suggested for confidence in
subsequent analyses [14].
The orientation of a discontinuity can be recorded either
as a strike azimuth and dip magnitude, preferably using
the right-hand rule, or as a dip azimuth and magnitude
(eliminating the need for dip direction and alpha
characters required by the quadrant system). According
to the right-hand rule, the strike azimuth is always to the
left of the dip direction. When the thumb of the right
hand is pointed in the strike direction, the fingers point
in the dip direction. The selected recording method
should be used consistently throughout the survey.
Data acquired in a single straight-line survey are
inherently biased. The more nearly the strike of a discon-
tinuity parallels the path of a line survey, the less
frequently discontinuities with that strike will be
207
FIELD MANUAL
recorded in the survey. This is called line bias. The
number of intersecting discontinuities is proportional to
the sine of the angle of intersection. In order to compen-
sate for line bias, a sufficient number of line surveys at a
sufficient variety of orientations should be conducted to
ensure that discontinuities of any orientation are inter-
sected by at least one survey at an angle of at least
30 degrees. Common practice is to perform two surveys
at nearly right angles or three surveys at radial angles of
120 degrees. True discontinuity (set) spacing and trace
lengths can be obtained by correcting the bias produced
by line surveys [15, 16].
All discontinuities should be recorded regardless of
subtlety, continuity, or other property until determined
otherwise. Data collection should be as systematic as
practicable, and accessible or easily measurable discon-
tinuities should not be preferentially measured. Con-
sistency and completeness of descriptions are also
important. Consistency and completeness are best main-
tained if all measurements are taken by the same mapper
and data are recorded on a form that prompts the mapper
for the necessary descriptors. A form minimizes the
probability of descriptor omission and facilitates plotting
on an equal area projection, commonly the Schmidt net
(figure 7-1), or entering data for subsequent analysis.
Computer programs are available that plot
discontinuities in a variety of projections and perform a
variety of analyses. Whether the plot format is the equal
area projection (Schmidt net) or equal angle projection
(Wulff net), evaluation of the plotted data requires an
understanding of the method of data collection, form of
presentation, and any data bias corrections. References
2 and 3 in the bibliography are good sources of data
analysis background information.

Figure 7-1.—Equatorial equal area net (Schmidt net).
Different rock types in the same structural terrain can
have different discontinuity properties and patterns, and
the host rock for each discontinuity should be recorded.
This could be an important factor for understanding sub-
sequent evaluations of tunneling conditions, rock slopes,
or the inplace stress field in underground openings.
Figure 7-2 is a form that can be used to record the data in
an abbreviated or coded format. Recording these data
will provide the necessary information for determining

EXPLORATION DRILLING
PROGRAMS
Introduction
This chapter is a guide for developing effective and
efficient exploration drilling programs. Drilling
programs that involve extensive soil sampling, rock
coring, instrumentation installations, or in-place testing
commonly have excessive cost overruns and late
completion times. The effort put into developing a well
organized drilling program that explicitly defines drilling
and sampling requirements can lower exploration costs
significantly by eliminating unnecessary or redundant
work and meeting schedules. Good references on drilling
methods and equipment are Groundwater and Wells,
second edition, by Fletcher G. Driscoll, published by
Johnson Division, St. Paul, Minnesota 55112, and
Drilling: The Manual of Methods, Applications, and
Management, CRC Lewis Publishers, Boca Raton,
Florida, 1996.
Planning the Exploration Drilling Program
Developing an exploration program requires a thorough
knowledge of the design requirements, site conditions,
drilling equipment requirements and capabilities, and
soil or rock core testing. It is extremely important that
exploration needs be identified to avoid overdesign of a
program by too many “it would be nice” requests.
A complete and detailed description of the drill site
location, accessibility, work requirements, geology, and
other pertinent information should be made available to
either the drilling contractor or in-house drilling staff.
This information is necessary for an effective and
efficient drilling operation that will accomplish the
program objectives. A major objective is to obtain the
most information and samples possible from each hole by
FIELD MANUAL
optimizing location, drilling and sampling methods,
depth, and completion. For example, a drill hole on the
intersection of dam and outlet works centerlines drilled
to the depth of the deepest data requirement and
sampled for both structures provides data for both
structures.
Most exploration is done in phases, with subsequent
exploration designed to refine the understanding of a
site. Drill holes should be logged as the holes are drilled,
so hole depths and subsequent hole locations can be
changed as exploration progresses. Because an
exploration program evolves as data are acquired,
information should be reviewed and added to maps and
sections as the data become available.
Site Inspection
An onsite inspection of the drilling location should be
made by the geologist, designers, and other essential
members of the exploration team. The purpose of the
onsite inspection is to determine the exploration needed
to provide the data required for design. Data are
required for several design disciplines with different
needs. Having knowledgeable representatives see the
site is important when formulating an exploration
program. Changes and additions to exploration
programs during or after exploration are expected but
can be minimized with careful planning.
During the site inspection, the geologist and designers
should discuss in detail all the design concerns that can
only be solved by analyzing the subsurface geology. The
team should be explicit as to the size, quantity, type, and
quality of soil or rock samples that are necessary to
develop an accurate evaluation of geologic conditions.
The geologist can recommend the type of equipment and
214
DRILLING PROGRAMS
drilling procedures needed, based on the drilling and
sampling requirements, and to address design concerns
as well as to provide samples needed for laboratory
testing.
The onsite inspection should provide other pertinent
information which is critical to the selection of specific
equipment. The following factors should be addressed
when preparing the exploration plan.
Topography-drill site accessibility.—The type of
drilling equipment most suitable for the work needs to
be determined. Truck-mounted, all-terrain, skid-
mounted, or a combination of several types may be
appropriate. Heavy excavation and hauling equipment
may be required to construct access roads, drill pads,
stream crossings, temporary bridges, or pipe culverts for
river crossings. Explosives and track drills may be
required to prepare drill pads or remove unsafe rock
overhangs from drill sites, and roadbase or rockfill may
have to be to be placed over soft mud or swamp.
Helicopter support may be needed for fly-in rigs and
heavy timber clearing. A source of water for drilling
needs to be identified. Other considerations are whether
there is a relatively close and level area that may be
used as a temporary drill yard/staging area and how
close equipment can be safely driven into the drill area.
Right-of-way, access permits, drilling permits,
construction or clearing permits.—The drilling
locations, whether on public or private land, may require
access permits. Several different types of permits may
be needed, including archeological and environmental
permits. These permits may take considerable time to
obtain and should be acquired as soon as possible. The
limitations of the permits should be determined.
Construction or clearing permits may be needed. Most
215
FIELD MANUAL
states require special licenses or permits for drill op-
erators who perform water-well drilling and installation.
Protection of the Environment
Environmental, archeological, and biological factors may
place restrictions or conditions on a site. Disposal of the
cleared material should be arranged. The use of drilling
mud requires planning and implementation prior to
drilling. If the drill mud circulation pits can be
excavated, the mud pits may have to be enclosed with
fencing to keep out animals. Drill mud and cuttings as
well as fuel and oil spills or oil change residue will
require disposal. Some drill mud, cuttings, and water
should be stored because the material is considered a
hazardous waste. These materials may have to be
disposed of at approved sites. Crossing shallow streams
can create contamination or turbidity problems. Drill
hole completion and site restoration should be
formulated. Dust abatement may be necessary for travel
over the access roads. Routes through planted fields
should be arranged before travel.
Drilling
Many factors should be considered during the
development of the exploration plan as listed below:
• Are the drill sites on rock
• Can downhole hammers be used to set collar
casing
• Are surficial materials suitable for hollow-stem
auger use
• If the drill hole is to be water-pressure tested,
may drilling mud or air foam be used
216

through the surficial deposits so that rock coring
can be performed

core sizes compatible with existing commercially
available equipment
• Will the samples or cores have to be transmitted
to the testing laboratories in sealed liners, split
tube liners, thin-wall steel tubes, or cheesecloth
and wax seals in core boxes
• Are there special concerns for the samples and
their delivery
• Will those concerns require them to be
transported in vibration-free containers
• Should the samples be protected from freezing
• Should the samples be weighed in the field and
the density and moisture content determined
before delivery to the laboratories
• What is the minimum drill equipment that should
be specified considering the total hole depth, size
of core or soil sample requirements, borehole
diameter, and rod size
• What is the minimum mud pump or air
compressor rating that should be specified
• Where is the water source; will water have to be
hauled or can it be pumped to the drill site
• How much water line will have to be laid
218
DRILLING PROGRAMS
Traffic Control and Safety
• Will the drill locations require traffic control,
detours, barricades, flag personnel, etc., for safety
and public protection
• Will road or highway travel require rerouting
during the drilling program
• Has permission been obtained from local, county,
or state officials to close roads
• Will drilling be performed in high visibility areas
• Will equipment security and vandalism be enough
of a problem to warrant nighttime security
personnel or fencing
Special Considerations
• Will the drilling require excavating or
constructing ramps and drill pads on the slope
face of an earth embankment
• Will the embankment slope face drilling have to
be done with skid-rigs on timber cribbing
platforms or with specialized drills that are
capable of traversing and drilling into
embankment slope faces without excavating
ramps or benches
• Will underground drilling be required
• Establish and include all underground safety
requirements in the drilling specifications

Drilling in Dam Embankments
The Bureau of Reclamation's (Reclamation) embankment
design practice minimizes development of stress patterns
within an embankment. Stress patterns could lead to
hydraulic fracturing by drill fluids during drilling.
Certain embankment locations and conditions have a
higher potential for hydraulic fracturing than others, and
improper drilling procedures or methods will increase
the potential for hydraulic fracturing. Site locations and
conditions where hydraulic fracturing by drilling media
are more likely to occur and adversely affect a structure's
performance include the following:
1. In impervious cores with slopes steeper than
0.5H:1V, cut-off trenches, and upstream-inclined
cores.
2. Near abutments steeper than 0.5H:1V, where
abrupt changes in slopes occur, and above boundaries
in the foundation which sharply separate areas of
contrasting compressibility.
3. Near structures within embankments.
4. In impervious zones consisting of silt or mixtures
of fine sand and silt.
Recommended procedures for developing exploration and
instrumentation programs and for drilling in the
impervious portion of embankment dams are as follows:
221
FIELD MANUAL
1. The embankment design should indicate whether
a hydraulic fracturing potential exists.
2. If a high potential for hydrofracturing exists, the
type of equipment and the method and technique to
be used for drilling must have the approval of the
exploration team. Once drilling has commenced,
drilling personnel are responsible for controlling and
monitoring drill media pressure, drill media
circulation loss, and penetration rate to assure that
the drilling operation minimizes the possibility for
hydraulic fracturing.
3. If a sudden loss of drill fluid occurs during any
embankment drilling within the dam core, drilling
should be stopped immediately. Action should be
taken to stop the loss of drill fluid. The reason for
loss should be determined, and if hydraulic fracturing
may have been the reason for the fluid loss, the
geologist and designer should be notified.
With the exception of augering, any drilling method has
the potential to hydraulically fracture an embankment
if care is not taken and attention is not paid to detail.
Augering is the preferred method of drilling in the core
of embankment dams. Augering does not pressurize the
embankment, and no potential for hydrofracturing
exists. Use of a hollow-stem auger permits sampling in
the embankment and allows sampling/testing of the
founda-tion through the auger’s hollow stem, which acts
as casing.
Drilling methods which may be approved for drilling in
embankment dams if augering is not practical (i.e.,
cobbly fill) are as follows:
222
DRILLING PROGRAMS
1. Cable tool
2. Direct rotary with mud (bentonite or
biodegradable)
3. Direct rotary with water
4. Direct rotary with air-foam
5. Down-hole hammer with reverse circulation
Selection of any one of the above methods should be
based on site-specific conditions, hole utilization,
economic considerations, and availability of equipment
and trained personnel.
Any drilling into the impervious core of an embankment
dam should be performed by experienced drill crews that
employ methods and procedures that minimize the
potential for hydraulic fracturing. It is essential that
drillers be well trained and aware of the causes of and
the problems resulting from hydraulic fracturing.

general are available in Reclamation Safety and Health
Standards, Bureau of Reclamation, United States

GROUNDWATER DATA
ACQUISITION METHODS
Introduction
This chapter provides information that will help select,
install, and operate appropriate groundwater instrumen-
tation and to collect, establish, maintain, and present the
groundwater data. Most types of engineering geology
investigations require acquisition and use of
groundwater data. The data required may vary from
simple monthly verification of the water level elevations
along a canal-axis profile to hourly monitoring of
piezometric conditions in multiple zones within a
landslide or embankment. Successful implementation of
a groundwater instrumen-tation program depends on
knowledge of subsurface conditions, preliminary
identification of all probable future uses of the data, and
careful planning of an instrumentation system and data
acquisition program to meet these data requirements.
This chapter will provide the user with:
• A detailed description of methods employed in
designing and installing groundwater monitoring
systems.
• A detailed description of available manual and
automated methods and techniques used in
monitoring ground and surface water.
• A discussion of data base management and data
presentation.
• A listing of more detailed and specific source
material on groundwater data acquisition methods.
FIELD MANUAL
General
The importance of fully evaluating and understanding
geologic factors controlling groundwater flow—including
porosity, storativity, permeability, transmissivity, velo-
city, recharge, and discharge—cannot be
overemphasized. This evaluation needs to be made at the
onset of the exploration program and continually
repeated throughout the investigations. These factors
will ultimately control the type of groundwater
acquisition methods required.
Geologic Controls on Groundwater
Geologic controls on groundwater flow impact the design
of observation systems and must be identified in the
preliminary planning of the instrumentation program.
For example:
1. Permeable materials, such as clastic sediments,
karstic limestone, and fractured rock, control the
type and size of well point, well screen, or
piezometer to be used and must be accounted for in
designing instrumentation for the program.
2. Relatively impermeable materials, such as clays,
silts, shales, siltstones, and massive rock present
special problems which must be accounted for in
selecting the type and size of piezometer to be
installed. Generally these materials require use of
the smallest size piezometer practical because
changes in water level and volume in the hole are
small and require long periods of time to react. Pore
pressure measurements in this type of geologic
environment should be considered, particularly if
short-term periodic—daily or weekly—changes in
groundwater conditions are needed.
228
GROUNDWATER
3. Layering, attitude of layers, boundaries, weath-
ering and alteration, and environment of deposition
all influence selection of instrumentation.
Design and Installation of Observation
Wells and Piezometers
Analysis of the Geologic Environment
The presence of variations in the geologic environment
must be anticipated. Perched water tables, artesian
aquifers, sources of recharge and discharge, known
boundaries and barriers, and structural controls such as
fractures, joints, faults, shears, slides, folds, and strati-
graphic contacts should be considered when selecting
instrument types and sizes. The preliminary instrumen-
tation design should be advanced enough to allow
procurement of needed equipment, but flexible enough to
adapt to changes in the environment.
Different types of groundwater observation instruments
provide different data types. Observation wells and
piezometers are selected in accordance with the data
required and the aquifer material and type. To be
useful, reliable, and accurate, the well or piezometer
design must be tailored to the subsurface conditions.
Single or unconfined aquifer zones can be monitored by
using a screened or perforated standpipe or porous tube
piezometer, or by a pore-pressure transducer. Multiple
zones may be monitored using multiple drill holes,
multiple piezometers in a single drill hole, or multiple
piezometer ports in a single standpipe.
229
FIELD MANUAL
Design
The most important aspect in the design of a
groundwater monitoring well is the purpose and use of
the well; whether for taking water samples, measuring
water levels, geophysical investigations, or a combination
of uses.
The hydrogeologic environment and the type of down-
hole instruments that may be used in the well will
influence the choice of well diameter, casing type, screen
to be used, and the interval to be monitored.
Components of a typical well include a screened interval
surrounded by filter/gravel-pack material isolated by a
bentonite and/or cement grout seal, blank casing to the
surface, and a protective well cover.
PVC is the most widely used material for standpipes
(casing and screens) in monitoring wells. It is relatively
inexpensive and presents few chemical interferences in
water quality sampling. Many other materials are
available for specific uses, including galvanized and
stainless steel, Teflon©, and other plastics.
The diameter of the well depends on the instrumentation
to be installed and the intended use. If the well is to be
sampled, by either pump or bailer, a 3-inch (75-mm)
diameter hole is the preferred size for accuracy and for
complete development of the hole, but smaller sizes can
be used with small bailers and peristaltic pumps. Wells
used for measuring water levels only may be smaller
diameter or may have multiple small diameter
standpipes within a 4-inch (100-mm) to 8-inch (200-mm)
diameter hole. A standpipe designed to accommodate an
M-scope water level sensor can be ¾ inch (19 mm)
diameter. However, if the standpipe is to be
230
GROUNDWATER
instrumented with a pneumatic or vibrating wire
piezometer or if a recorder and electric probe will be used
to monitor the water level, then the diameter of the
standpipe depends on the size of the instrument or
transducer to be installed. Lengths of well screen and
casing (PVC perforated and solid standpipe) must have
uniform inner and outer casing diameters. Inconsistent
inner diameters cause problems when instruments with
tight clearance are lowered into the well. The pipe may
need to be reamed to remove the beads and burrs. A
filter pack is generally composed of washed sand and
gravel and is placed within the screened interval. The
interval may extend above the screen depending on the
zone thickness. The pack is designed primarily to allow
water to enter the standpipe while preventing the
movement of fines into the pipe through the slots, and to
allow water to leave the standpipe when water levels
drop. If the well is to be used for sampling, the pack
material should be sterilized to prevent possible
contamination before placement into the well. The
gravel pack should be tremied through a pipe to prevent
bridging. The top of the pack may be checked using a
small diameter tamping tool, or a properly weighted sur-
veyor’s tape.
A seal is installed to create an impermeable boundary
between the standpipe and the casing or drill hole wall.
The seal should be placed in a zone of low permeability,
such as a clay bed above the zone to be monitored. This
ensures that water will not travel vertically along the
casing or drill hole.
Cement grout can shrink due to temperature changes
during curing and may crack. This causes a poor bond
between the grout and the standpipe. A 1-foot (0.3-m)
bentonite seal should be placed preferably as pellets or
by tremieing a bentonite slurry immediately below and
231
FIELD MANUAL
above the cement grout seal. This helps ensure a
reliable plug. Any seal material (optional with bentonite
pellets) should be tremied into place. This prevents
bridging or caking along the hole wall. The seal must be
reliable so that the screened interval monitors only the
desired groundwater zone.
A drill hole containing multiple standpipes, each mon-
itoring a zone or distinct water bearing strata, may have
several isolating seals. To test the integrity of the seals,
a gravity head test may be performed by adding water to
the shallowest standpipe and continuously measuring
the water level in the next lower piezometer to detect
any leakage through or around the seals. If the water
leaks into the lower interval, the piezometric head will
rise in the lower standpipe.
A protective cover helps prevent damage to the standpipe
and reduces surface water drainage into the backfilled
hole. The casing should extend 5 to 10 feet (1.5 to 3 m)
below ground and be grouted into place. Upon
completion of the monitoring well, standpipe should be
bailed or blown dry and the water level allowed to
recover to a static level. A completion log should be
prepared using the drillers' records, geologic log, and
measurements. The log should include the actual depths
and thicknesses of each component of the well; the
standpipe's total depth; the screened interval, the
isolated interval; the type of filter pack; the depth,
thickness, and type of isolating seals; and a reference
point from which all measurements were taken, such as
top of casing or ground surface. Many excellent
references are available to design and install
groundwater monitoring wells for various purposes.
Refer to these at the end of this chapter for more
detailed instructions.

GROUNDWATER
Construction Materials
Construction materials for observation wells and
piezometers are dictated by the projected use of the
instrument and the permeability of the aquifer. The
diameter of the standpipe, the type of standpipe used
(metal versus plastic), screen slot size/porous tube type,
and gravel pack material are all variables dictated by
aquifer characteristics.
In a relatively permeable material, the diameter of a
standpipe is not critical; sand or gravel pack around the
well tip may not be required, but the screen slot size may
be critical to the success of the installation. Too small
screen or slot size may restrict instrument reaction to
changes in water levels.
In a relatively impermeable material, pipe diameter may
be critical, a pack material of select sand or fabric wrap
usually is required, and a well point or screen assembly
usually is needed, (0.010-0.020-inch [0.0250.05
centimeter (cm)] slot size). Generally, the smallest
diameter pipe practical should be used in this sort of
monitoring application, keeping in mind that the
standpipe diameter must be large enough to install a
means of measuring water levels. If the volume of the
hole is too large, too much water must move in and out
of the hole to accurately reflect the water level. If rapid
reaction to water level or changes is needed, a pressure
transducer may be more appropriate than an open-tube
piezometer or standpipe.
A variety of materials can be used as the standpipe.
Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastic pipe is economical and
easy to install. Plastic pipe is fairly fragile, deformable,
and can be destroyed accidentally during installation.
Metal pipe is more durable for installation but generally
233
FIELD MANUAL
costs more than plastic, rusts or corrodes, and is subject
to iron bacterial action. Generally, if grout plugs are
used to isolate zones, black pipe is preferred because the
zinc in galvanized pipe can react with the plug and
destroy the seal. The inside diameter (I.D.) of the pipe
depends on the permeability of the aquifer material and
can vary from as small as ½ inch (13 millimeters [mm])
to 2 inches (50 mm) or larger. The diameter of the riser
is critical to instrumentation of the observation well or
piezometer. Generally, ¾-inch (19 mm) pipe is the
smallest practical size that can be used in automated
applications. Reaming of the pipe prior to installation to
remove burrs, weld seams, and blebs of galvanizing
material is a necessary precaution to ensure that the
standpipe will be usable if the pipe I.D. and measuring
device outside diameter (O.D.) are close.
The screen assembly selected for an observation well or
piezometer can be a well point, well screen, porous tube,
or perforated pipe (commercially manufactured or field
fabricated). Screen should be PVC or corrosion-resistant
metal. Slot-size is determined by filter material size and
aquifer material.
The gravel-pack material selected is determined by the
particle sizes of the aquifer material and the size of the
well screen. Concrete sand or reasonably well-graded
sand to pea gravel can be used.
Plug material used to isolate the interval to be monitored
can be tremied cement grout, bentonite pellets, or a com-
bination of the two. A bentonite slurry also may be used
in some instances but must be tremied in place.
Bentonite pellets are preferred if only one isolation
method is used.

Methods Used to Measure
Groundwater Levels
General
Groundwater measurements (and any instrumentation
readings) should be interpreted concurrently with read-
ing. Erroneous readings and faulty equipment need to
be detected as encountered, and timely interpretation is
a reliable method of bad reading detection. The
person(s) taking the readings must understand the
equipment and gather reliable data from the
instruments. If bad read-ings or faulty equipment are
not detected by concurrent interpretation, months of
irretrievable data can be lost, and erroneous
interpretations or data impossible to inter-pret can
result.
Manual Methods Used to Measure Groundwater
Levels
Chalk and Surveyors' Chain.—Probably the oldest
and one of the most reliable methods for measuring wells
is the surveyors' chain and chalk method. This method
is not recommended where water level depths exceed
several hundred feet (300 m+).
A lead weight may (but not necessary) be attached to a
steel measuring tape (surveyors' chain). The lower 5 feet
(1.5 m) of the tape is wiped dry and covered with solid
carpenter's chalk if the water level is roughly known.
The tape is lowered into the well, and one of the foot
marks is held exactly at the top of the casing. The tape
is pulled up. The line can be read to a hundredth of a
foot (0.003 m) on the chalked section. This reading is
sub-tracted from the mark held at the measuring point,
and the difference is the depth to water.
235
FIELD MANUAL
The disadvantage to this method is that the approximate
water depth must be known so that a portion of the
chalked section will be submerged to produce a wetted
line. Deep holes require a long surveyor’s chain which
can be difficult to handle.
M-Scope (Electric Sounder).—An M-scope is an
electric sounder or electrical depth gauge consisting of an
electrode suspended by a pair of insulated wires and a
milliammeter that indicates a closed circuit and flow of
current when the electrode touches the water surface.
Usually, AA flashlight batteries supply the current. The
insulated wire usually is marked off in 1-foot to 5-foot
(0.3- to 1.5-m) intervals. The best devices have the
measuring marks embedded directly into the line.
Markers that are attached to the line slip, making it
necessary to calibrate the instrument frequently.
With the reel and indicator wire in one hand and the
other hand palm up with the index finger over the casing
or piezometer pipe, the wire is lowered slowly over the
finger into the piezometer pipe or well casing. By sliding
the wire over the finger, the wire is not cut or damaged
by the sharp casing or piezometer pipe. Several readings
can be taken to eliminate any errors from kinks or bends
in the wire. The water level depth can be measured from
the top of casing using the mark-tags on the insulated
wire and a tape measure marked in tenths and hun-
dredths of a foot. The advantage of this method is that
water level depths in holes several hundred feet deep can
be measured fairly quickly and accurately. The disad-
vantage to this method is that malfunctioning or
mechanical problems develop in the instrument giving
er-roneous water level readings. Before going into the
field, the instrument must be checked for low batteries,
tears, scrapes on the insulated wires, and iron-calcium
buildup on the part of the electrode touching the water
surface.
236
GROUNDWATER
Airline and Gauge.—This method uses a small
diameter pipe or tube inserted into the top of the well
casing down to several feet below the lowest anticipated
water level. The exact length of airline is measured as
the line is placed in the well. The airline must be air
tight and should be checked. The airline must hang
vertically and be free from twists and spirals inside the
casing. Quarter-inch (6.3 mm) copper or brass tubing
can be used. The upper end of the airline is fitted with
suitable connections and a Schraeder valve so that an
ordinary tire pump can be used to pump air into the
tube. A tee is placed in the line so that air pressure can
be measured on a pressure gauge.
This device works on the principle that the air pressure
required to push all the water out of the submerged
portion of the tube equals the water pressure of a column
of water of that height. A reference point (e.g., top of
casing or pipe) and the depth to the lower end of the
airline must be known. Air is pumped into the airline
until the pressure on the gauge increases to a maximum
point where all the water has been forced out of the
airline. At this point, the air pressure in the tube just
balances the water pressure. The gauge reading shows
the pressure necessary to support a column of water of
a height equal to the distance from the water level in the
well to the bottom of the tube.
If the gauge reads the direct head of water, the
submerged length of airline is read directly. The total
length of airline to the reference point, minus the
submerged length gives the depth to water below the
measuring point. If the gauge reads in pounds per
square inch, multiply the reading by 2.31 to convert to
feet of water. An accurate, calibrated gauge and a
straight, air-tight airline are important.
237
FIELD MANUAL
Popper.—A simple and reliable method of measuring
water levels is with a popper. A tape with a popper
attached to the bottom is lowered into the well or casing
until the water is reached, as indicated by a pop. The
popper is raised above and lowered to the water surface
several times to accurately determine the distance. A
popper consists of a small cylinder closed at the top and
open at the bottom. The open bottom causes a popping
sound when the water surface is hit. A 1-inch (in) or
1½-in (25- or 40-mm) pipe nipple 2 to 3 in (50 to 75 mm)
long with a cap on top works satisfactorily.
Pressure Gauge for Monitoring Artesian Wells.—
Additional standpipe or casing can theoretically be ex-
tended to eventually equal the head of the water. A
simple method to determine the artesian head is to
attach a pressure gauge to the casing or the piezometer
pipe. The gauge selected may be read directly or in feet
(meters) of water. Install a tee on the standpipe or on
the casing so that a pressure gauge and valve can be
attached to the tee. The valve may be used to bleed the
pressure gauge to see if the gauge is working and can be
used to measure the flow on the artesian well. When a
pressure reading is taken, a flow measurement should
also be taken. During the winter months, the valve
should be cracked open to allow the well to flow slightly
to prevent the riser pipe from freezing and breaking.
The line to the gauge should be bled of water. If the
pressure gauge used is in lbs/in2, multiply the gauge
reading by 2.31 to obtain the head of water above the
valve.
Continuous Recorders
Stevens Recorder.—The Stevens Recorder (produced
by Stevens Water Resources Products) provides a
reliable and economical way to obtain continuous water
238
GROUNDWATER
level data. The recorder is a float type consisting of a 3-
to 6-inch (76- to 152-mm) float connected to a pulley
which turns a calibrated gear-driven drum. A power
source, such as a spring clock or small motor, rotates the
drum at a known rate giving a constant indication of
elapsed time.
Gearing between the float pulley and the chart drum
provide a changeable ratio of water movement to pen
movement on the chart. A time scale is available on the
chart, and continuous recordings may be maintained for
up to several months. When a Stevens recorder is used
in a well, the minimum diameter of the well casing is
4 inches (100 cm). An advantage of the Stevens recorder
is versatility. Hydrographs can be created with scales of
1:1 to 1:20. Most recorders can be set from 4 hours to
several months. Johnson-Keck has a water level sensing
instrument that can continuously record water levels in
½-inch (13-mm) pipe and larger. Transistorized circuitry
is used to control a battery powered motorized reel. The
sensing float is attached to one end of the control wire,
and the other end of the wire is connected to the reel.
The instrument is connected to a Stevens type F or
Stevens type A recorder. The control wire passes around
the recorder pulley, and the sensing device is placed in
the casing. The sensing device seeks the water surface;
and once the water surface is found, the circuitry keeps
the sensing device at the water surface.
Many float recorders can be attached to digital recorders
for continuous records. Data from this type of
instrument can be used and easily interfaced with a
computer system.
Bristol Recorders.—Recorders for monitoring contin-
uous artesian pressures are produced by Bristol Instru-
ment Systems. The Bristol and Stevens recorders are
similar in that pressure and time are recorded on a
239
FIELD MANUAL
chart. The instrument usually contains diaphragms that
can be adjusted to varying pressure conditions. The
spring-driven clock usually is calibrated for 30 days. The
Bristol recorder is very useful for observing pressure
changes in artesian wells but is limited by freezing
conditions in northern climates. A pressure gauge
installed in the line between the artesian water and the
pressure recorder is very useful. This gauge provides a
good indication of the working condition of the
instrument.
Gas Bubbler Transducer.—Pneumatic or gas bubble
transducers are manufactured by many companies. The
transducers vary from a single readout box to a compli-
cated array of instruments that will measure several
wells at once. A gas is forced through a tube at a
constant rate past a diaphragm. When the pressure of
the gas on the diaphragm and the water pressure on the
other side of the diaphragm are equal, a constant
reading is obtained. This reading equals the amount of
water over the diaphragm. This number multiplied by
2.31 will give the amount of water head over the
instrument. These instruments may be used as a single
unit or connected into an electronic data acquisition
system.
Maintenance.—A good maintenance program is neces-
sary to ensure reliable performance of mechanically
actuated recorders. The instruments and data collected
are only as good as the preventive maintenance. A
routine preventive maintenance program should be
scheduled for all the instruments. In some cases, daily
inspection of recorders is required; however, if the
instrument is working properly, weekly inspections may
be sufficient. Preventive maintenance can often be
accomplished when the charts are changed.

Methods and Techniques Used to Estimate
Flows from Seeps, Springs, and Small Drainages
A thorough and detailed discussion of weirs, flumes,
stilling wells, and other techniques is presented in
Reclamation’s Water Measurement Manual [1]. Small
seeps, springs, and intermittent drainages are often
encountered in field investigations. These features can
provide key information during design and construction
and may be key indicators of structure performance or
environmental impacts that may affect the project. The
location of drainage features, the rate of flow, and the
time of year of the observation are important
information. Flow can be estimated accurately using the
methods described below:
Estimate the rate of flow in an open channel using
Q=VA, where:
Q = rate of flow
V = velocity
A = cross sectional area of channel
The cross-sectional area is determined by direct meas-
urements where possible. Where impractical, the cross-
sectional area may be estimated or scaled from a topo-
graphic map.
Velocity is determined using a float, a measuring tape,
and a stop watch by timing how long a floating object
takes to travel a given distance. This provides a crude
but reasonably accurate estimate of flow. Other methods
may include a pitot tube or flow meter.
Substitute the values obtained into the Q=VA equation
to obtain the volume of flow.
241
FIELD MANUAL
Measure flow from small springs and seeps directly by
diverting the flow, or in some manner channel the flow
to a point for collection in a container, such as a bucket.
Determine the rate of flow by timing how long it takes to
fill the container. Select points along a drainage where
abrupt dropoffs occur and use this method. It is better
to measure, however crudely; but if not possible,
estimate the flow. Many more sophisticated methods
can be used to obtain more accurate flow measurements,
if necessary. Determination of the most appropriate
method can be made if preliminary data are available.
Computer-Based Monitoring Systems
General
Water level monitoring may be automated. Monitoring
landslides can require a great number of points and
frequent readings. A variety of data types may be
required, which may include measurements of not only
water levels and pore pressure changes, but deformation
and movement as well. Systems required to collect,
store, format, and present these data are available
allowing realtime analysis of a wide variety of data
types.
Components of a Computer-Based
Monitoring System
1. Many types of instruments including inclinometers,
pressure transducers, strain gauges, water level gauges,
and flowmeters can be used in a monitoring system.
Electronic instruments are available in many sizes and
shapes; preliminary selection of the instrument type
242
GROUNDWATER
should be made during the initial design of the system.
The inside diameter of the well must be sized to accept
the transducer.
2. Acquired data is sent from the instrument at the well
to the data logger or processor. This is done by hardwire
from the instrument, line-of-sight radio, satellite radio,
or phone lines.
Data from the monitoring points may be preprocessed in
the field prior to transmittal to the central computer. A
number of microprocessor data scanners that collect and
reduce data can be installed at various field locations.
The central computer queries the field scanners to obtain
periodic updates. The remote scanners can be interro-
gated as frequently as desired. This may include a
continuous data scan mode.
3. Data scanners reduce the instrument output to usable
data. Data scanners can be the end destination for more
simple systems or can be part of a more elaborate
system. Generally, two types of signals are generated by
instruments used in geotechnical monitoring: (a) digital
and (b) analog current or voltages. Data scanners which
accept and reduce data from both types of signals are
available.
Many manufacturers offer complete packages of auto-
mated instrumentation systems, including computer
hardware and software. If the initial observation well
program is designed for automation, most of these
systems will provide the high quality data required.
Special Applications
Many types of instrumentation can be used in a single
drill hole. A multiple use casing collects groundwater
243
FIELD MANUAL
data from a large number of horizons within a single
drill hole. Casing is available specifically for pore-
pressure observations, or grooved casing can be used so
that the well can be completed for both pressure and
inclinometer measurements. Isolation between horizons
can be accom-plished either by installing a bentonite seal
or by using a packer assembly designed as an integral
part of a monitoring system. Use of a monitoring system
greatly reduces drilling costs, provides detailed
monitoring of critical drill holes, and provides a greater
flexibility than systems previously available. Small
diameter drill holes can be used to obtain a large number
of isolated water level intervals and, depending on the
application, can be very cost effective.
Data Base Management and Data Presentation
Standard forms are available to record field data,
although standard data sheets often must be modified
for specific applications. Data sheets must include
remarks and information that include the monitoring
well num-ber, location, elevation reference points, type
and size of well, dates and times the well was read,
depth to water, and the elevation of the water surface.
Periodic readings of these observation wells over long
periods of time generate numerous data sheets.
Computerization of the data base very rapidly can
become a necessity if data are to be readily available and
easily analyzed.
Data entry and storage in digital format allows
electronic transfer of data and greater flexibility in
developing, analyzing, and presenting data. Data may
be tabulated or presented as time-depth/elevation plots
and interpre-tive drawings such as contours and other
three dimensional plots. Tremendous volumes of data
244
GROUNDWATER
can be reduced quickly to a usable format. Use of a
commer-cially available data base allows data use and
manipu-lation without specialized software or training.
Definitions
Aquifer—A body of soil or rock that is sufficiently
permeable to conduct groundwater and to yield
economically significant quantities of water to wells and
springs.
• Confined aquifer—An aquifer bounded above
by impermeable beds, or beds of distinctly lower
permeability than that of the aquifer itself. An
aquifer containing confined groundwater.
• Unconfined aquifer—An aquifer having a
water table. An aquifer containing unconfined
ground-water.
Artesian—An adjective referring to groundwater
confined under hydrostatic pressure.
Artesian aquifer—An aquifer containing water under
artesian pressure.
Aquitard—A confining bed that retards but does not
prevent the flow of water to or from an adjacent aquifer;
a leaky confining bed. An aquitard does not readily yield
water to wells or springs but may serve as a storage unit
for groundwater.
Aquiclude—A body of relatively impermeable rock or
soil that is capable of absorbing water slowly but
functions as an upper or lower boundary of an aquifer

245
FIELD MANUAL
Water table or water level—The surface between the
zone of saturation and the zone of aeration; the surface
of a body of unconfined groundwater at which the
pressure is equal to atmospheric pressure.
Zone of aeration or Vadose zone—Subsurface zone
containing water under pressure less than atmospheric,
including water held by capillarity, and containing air or
gases generally under atmospheric pressure. This zone
is limited above by the land surface and below by the
surface of the zone of saturation or water table.
Saturation—The maximum possible content of water in
the pore space of rock or soil.
Zone of saturation—A subsurface zone in which all of
the interstices are filled with groundwater under
pressure greater than atmospheric. The zone is still
considered saturated even though the zone may contain
gas-filled interstices or interstices filled with fluid other
than water. This zone is separated from the zone of
aeration by the water table.

GUIDELINES FOR
CORE LOGGING
These guidelines incorporate procedures and methods
used by many field offices and are appropriate for
"standard" engineering geology/geotechnical log forms,
computerized log forms, and many of the modified log
forms used by various Bureau of Reclamation
(Reclamation) offices.
General
Introduction
This chapter describes the basic methods for engineering
geology core logging and provides examples and
instructions pertaining to format, descriptive data, and
techniques; procedures for working with drillers to obtain
the best data; caring for recovered core; and water testing
in drill holes. The chapter also provides a reference for
experienced loggers to improve their techniques and train
others. Most of the discussions and examples shown
pertain to logging rock core, but many discussions apply
to soil core logging, standard penetration resistance logs,
and drive tube sample logging.
Purpose, Use, and Importance of Quality Core
Logging
The ability of a foundation to accommodate structure
loads depends primarily on the deformability, strength,
and groundwater conditions of the foundation materials.
The remediation of a hazardous waste site can be
formulated only by proper characterization of the site.
Clear and accurate portrayal of geologic design and
evaluation data and analytical procedures is paramount.
Data reported in geologic logs not only must be accurate,
FIELD MANUAL
consistently recorded, and concise, but also must provide
quantitative and qualitative descriptions.
Logs provide fundamental data on which conclusions
regarding a site are based. Additional exploration or
testing, final design criteria, treatment design, methods
of construction, and eventually the evaluation of structure
performance may depend on core logs. A log may present
important data for immediate interpretations or use, or
may provide data that are used over a period of years.
The log may be used to delineate existing foundation
conditions, changes over time to the foundation or
structure, serve as part of contract documents, and may
be used as evidence in negotiations and/or in court to
resolve contract or possible responsible party (PRP)
disputes.
For engineering geology purposes, the basic objectives of
logging core are to provide a factual, accurate, and concise
record of the important geological and physical character-
istics of engineering significance. Characteristics which
influence deformability, strength, and water conditions
must be recorded appropriately for future interpretations
and analyses. Reclamation has adopted recognized
indexes, nomenclature, standard descriptors and
descriptive criteria, and alphanumeric descriptors for
physical properties to ensure that these data are recorded
uniformly, consistently, and accurately. Use of alpha-
numeric descriptors and indexes permits analysis of data
by computer. These descriptors, descriptive criteria,
examples, and supporting discussions are provided in
chapters 3, 4, and 5.
Exploration should be logged or, as a minimum, reviewed
by an experienced engineering geologist. The logger
should be aware of the multiple uses of the log and the
needs and interests of technically diverse users. The
250
CORE LOGGING
experienced logger concentrates on the primary purposes
of the individual drill hole as well as any subordinate
purposes, keeping in mind the interests of others with
varied geological backgrounds including geotechnical
engineers, contract drillers, construction personnel, and
contract lawyers. An experienced logger tailors the log to
meet these needs, describing some seemingly minor
features or conditions which have engineering
significance, and excluding petrologic features or geologic
conditions having only minor or academic interest. Less
experienced loggers may have a tendency to concentrate
on unnecessary garnishment, use irrelevant technical
terms, or produce an enormously detailed log which
ignores the engineering geology considerations and
perhaps the purpose for completing the drill hole.
Adequate descriptions of recovered cores and samples can
be prepared solely through visual or hand specimen
examination of the core with the aid of simple field tests.
Detailed microscopic or laboratory testing to define rock
type or mineralogy generally are necessary only in special
cases.
Empirical design methods, such as the Rock Mass Rating
System Geomechanics Classification (RMR) and Q-system
Classification (Q), are commonly used for design of under-
ground structures and are coming into common use for
other structures as well. If these methods are used, the
necessary data must be collected during core logging.
If hazardous waste site characterization is the primary
purpose of the drilling, the log should concentrate on
providing data for that type of investigation.
Drilling and logging are to determine the in-place
condition of the soil or rock mass. Any core condition,
core loss, or damage due to the type of bit, barrel, or other
equipment used, or due to improper techniques used in
251
FIELD MANUAL
the drilling and handling processes should be described.
Such factors may have a marked effect on the amount and
condition of the core recovered, particularly in soft,
friable, weathered, intensely fractured materials or zones
of shearing. Geologic logs require the adequate
description of materials; a detailed summary of drilling
equipment, methods, samplers, and significant
engineering conditions; and geologic interpretations.
Complete geologic logs of drill holes require adequate
descriptions of recovered surficial deposits and bedrock,
a detailed summary of drilling methods and conditions,
and appropriate physical characteristics and indexes to
ensure that adequate engineering data are available for
geologic interpretation and analysis.
Format and Required Data for the
Final Geologic Log
Organization of the Log
The log forms are divided into five basic sections: a
heading block; a left-hand column for notes; a center col-
umn for indexes, additional notes, water tests and
graphics; a right-hand column for classification and
physical conditions; and a comments/explanation block at

hole number, location, coordinates, elevation, bearing and
plunge of hole, dates started and completed, and the
name(s) of the person(s) responsible for logging and re-
view. Locations should preferably be in coordinates
unless station and offset are all that is available.
Provide both coordinates and station and offset if
available. The dip or plunge of the hole can be the angle
from horizontal or from vertical, but the reference point
should be noted on the log. Spaces for depth to bedrock
and water levels are also provided. All this information
is important and should not be omitted. Below the
heading, the body of the log form is divided into a series
of columns covering the various kinds of information
required according to the type of exploratory hole.
Data Required for the "Drilling Notes" Column
Data for the left-hand column of all drill hole logs are
similar whether for large-diameter sampling, Standard
Penetration Tests, rock core, or push-tube sampling logs.
These data are field observations and information
provided by the driller on the Daily Drill Reports.
Examples are provided for some of these data headings;
a suggested guideline and preferred order is presented in
the following paragraphs but may differ depending on the
purpose and type of exploration. Headers for data can
indicate whether depths are in feet (ft) or meters (m),
eliminating the need to repeat "ft" or "m" for each interval
entry. An example of the Drilling Notes column is
provided on figures 10-1 through 10-4.
General Information.—This includes headers and data
for the hole purpose, the setup or site conditions, drillers,
and drilling and testing equipment used.

FIELD MANUAL
1. Purpose of hole — Includes reason for drilling
the hole, such as foundation investigation, materials
investigation, instrumentation, sampling, or testing.
2. Drill site or setup — Includes general physical
description of the location of the drill hole.
Information on unusual setups, such as adjacent to
a stream, or drilled from a barge, gallery, or adit,
may help understand the unusual conditions.
3. Drillers — Names of drillers may be significant
for reference or for evaluating or interpreting core
losses, drilling rates, and other drilling conditions.
4. Drilling equipment —
• Drill rig (make and model)
• Core barrel(s), tube(s), special samplers (type
and size)
• Bits (type and size)
• Drill rods (type and size)
• Collar (type)
• Water test equipment (rod or pipe size, hose
size, pump type and capacity, and relative
position and elevation of pressure gauges or
transducers), packers (type—mechanical or
pneumatic)

minute (gal/min) (159 liters per minute)
maximum volume, and 1-in (25-mm) water
meter. (Water testing equipment can be a
separate heading if desired.)
Drilling Procedures and Conditions.—These headers
and data should include methods, conditions, driller's
comments, and records for water losses, caving, or casing.
1. Drilling methods — Synopsis of drilling, sam-
pling, and testing procedures, including procedures
and pressures for drive or push tubes used through
the various intervals of the hole.
2. Drilling conditions and driller's comments —
Note by interval the relative penetration rate and
the action of the drill during this process (i.e., 105.6-
107.9: drilled slowly, moderate blocking off, hole
advancing 15 minutes per foot [.3 meter]). Unusual
drilling conditions should be summarized. Changes
in drilling conditions may indicate differences in
lithology, weathering, or fracture density. The
geologist needs to account for variations in driller's
descriptions; each driller may describe similar
conditions with different adjectives or percentage
estimates. Any other comments relative to ease or
difficulty of advancing or maintaining the hole
should be noted by depth intervals. Drillers'
comments need to adequately describe conditions
encountered while advancing the hole. Statements
such as "normal drilling" or "no problems
encountered" are not useful.
Differences in drilling speeds, pressures, and
penetration rates may be related to the relative
265
FIELD MANUAL
hardness and density of materials. Abrupt changes
in drilling time may identify lithologic changes or
breaks and also may pinpoint soft or hard interbeds
within larger units. Often, these may be correlated
with geophysical logs. If the driller provides useful
and accurate records of drilling conditions and
procedures, an accurate determination of the top and
bottom of key marker horizons can be made even
without core.
Drilling progress should be recorded while drilling;
recovery can be improved by relating recovery to
optimum pressures and speeds, as well as providing
data for interpretation. For each run, the driller
should record the time when starting to drill and
when stopping to come out of the hole. Most of these
drilling progress data are qualitative rather than
quantitative values. Controlling factors are not only
the type of materials encountered but also may be
mechanical or driller variables. These variables may
include type and condition of the bit, rotation speed,
drilling fluid pressure, etc. THE PURPOSE OF THE
BORING IS TO OBTAIN THE HIGHEST QUALITY
CORE AND MOST COMPLETE RECOVERY AND
INFORMATION, NOT JUST FEET PER HOUR OR
SHIFT.
3. Drilling fluid — Type and where used (including
drilling fluid additives). This may be combined with
or discussed under the heading, drilling methods.
4. Drilling fluid return — Include interval/percent
return. Drilling fluid return may be combined with
color.
5. Drill fluid color — Include interval/color.
266
CORE LOGGING
6. Caving conditions — Intervals of cave with ap-
propriate remarks about the relative amount of
caving are to be noted. When possible, report the
actual caving interval rather than the depth of the
hole.
7. Casing record — Casing depth is the depth of
casing at the start of the drilled interval (see the
example below).
8. Advancement (push-tube or Standard
Penetration Test (SPT) applications) — Include
depth/ interval sampled.
9. Cementing record — Note all intervals
cemented and if intervals were cemented more than
once. This information may be combined with the
casing record, as shown below:
Example of casing and cementing record:
Interval drilled Size Casing depth

15.3-18.7 NxCs 15.0
18.7-33.2 Cmt 12.1-18.7 Cmt
Hole Completion and Monitoring Data.—Data shown
in this section of the left-hand column include hole
completion, surveys, water levels, drilling rates or time,
and reason for hole termination.
267

1. Borehole survey data — Include if obtained.
Example of survey data:

99 S 75E W 89E
119 S 72E W 89E
Average S 72E W 89E
1 E = degrees.
2. Water level data — Note depths and/or eleva-
tions, water quantities, and pressures from artesian
flows. Water levels or flows should be recorded
during hole advancement, between shifts, or at the
beginning or end of a shift, but definitely should be
recorded at completion of the hole and periodically
thereafter. It may be advantageous to leave space or
provide a note to refer the user to additional readings
provided elsewhere on the log for subsequent
measurements. Computer generated logs allow
convenient updating of water levels long after the
hole is completed.
Examples of drill hole logs illustrate optional format
and subsequent readings. Examples of how to record
data are:

pleted or backfilled; if jetting, washing, or bailing
was employed; depth of casing left in hole or that
casing was pulled; location and type of piezometers;
location, sizes, and types of slotted pipes (including
size and spacing of slots) or piezometer risers; type
and depth of backfill or depths of concrete and/or
bentonite plugs; location of isolated intervals; and
elevation at top of riser(s). Hole completion can be
shown graphically (see figure 10-5).

4. Reason for hole termination — State whether
the hole reached the planned depth or reason why
the hole was stopped short.
5. Drilling time — Total time, setup time, drilling
time, and downtime should be recorded on drillers'
daily sheets and should also be recorded on the drill
log. These records are essential for determining
exploration program costs.
Center Columns of the Drill Log
Computer Logs.—Computer-generated logs offer several
options for the content and format of the log such as
permeability, penetration resistance, or rock properties
which have some differences in format. Examples of each
are shown in figures 10-2 through 10-5.
Standard Geologic Log Form.—The following
discussion pertains to the center columns for the standard
Reclamation log (form 7-1337). The columns shown on
all figures are self-explanatory. The columns can be mod-
ified or new columns added to the existing log form for
recording appropriate indexes or special conditions.
The percolation tests (water-pressure tests) column
should record the general information of the tests.
Additional data may be recorded on "water testing" log
forms or drillers' reports.
Type and size of hole, elevation, and depth columns are
self-explanatory.
Core recovery should be recorded in percent of recovery
by run. Although desirable, core recovery does not
necessarily require a visual graph. Core recovery should
be noted carefully by the driller for each run on the daily
273
FIELD MANUAL
drill reports; however, this column should be the record
of those measurements determined by the geologist
during logging. Measuring the core while in the split
tube or sampler, if possible, will produce the most
accurate recovery records.
A hole completion column may be added which
graphically portrays how the hole was completed. If used,
an explanation of the graphic symbols should be provided
on the log form.
Rock quality designation (RQD) should be reported by
core run. RQD should be included on the log in graph or
tabular form regardless of the type project. RQD is used
in almost any engineering application of the hole data.
Most contractors are interested in RQD as an index of
blasting performance, rippability, and stability. RQD is
described and explained in chapter 5.
A lithologic log or graphic column is helpful to quickly
visualize the geologic conditions. Appropriate symbols
may be used for correlation of units, shear zones, water
levels, weathering, and fracturing (see figure 10-1).
The samples and testing column should include locations
of samples obtained for testing and can later have actual
sample results inserted in the column, if the column is
enlarged.
Modifications to Standard Log Form.—Modifications
or adaptations of the center columns are permissible and,
in some instances, encouraged. Examples are:
1. The use of a continuation sheet for longer drill
logs saves time and is easier to type. The sheets may
have only one column to continue the right-hand
narrative, or may be divided into two or more
274
CORE LOGGING
columns. See sheets 2 and 3 for drill hole SPT-107-2,
figure 10-4, for an example; also see sheet 3 of 3 for
drill hole DH-DN/P-60-1, figure 10-5.
2. The center column may be modified to portray ad-
ditional data such as hole completion, various
indexes, alphanumeric descriptors, or laboratory test
data.
Standard penetration test hole SPT-107-2,
figure 10-4, is a modified penetration resistance log
which shows laboratory test results; a percent
gravel/percent sand/ percent fines column; liquid
limit/plasticity index (LL/PI) column, a field moisture
column, and other modifications. Drill hole DH-SP-2,
figure 10-3, has columns for reporting field density
test results, moisture, porosity, percent saturation,
percent fines/percent sand, LL/PI, and laboratory
classification.
3. Another modification, shown on DH-SP-2,
figure 10-3, is a drawing showing the location of the
hole in relation to the structure being explored.
Diagrams or graphs, such as water levels, may
illustrate data better than a column of figures.
Required Data and Descriptions for the Right-
Hand "Classification and Physical Condition"
Column
General.—An accurate description of recovered core and
a technically sound interpretation of nonrecovered core
are the primary reasons for core logging. The logger
needs to remember that any interpretation, such as a
shear, must be based on observed factual data. The
interpreted reason for the core loss is given, but usually
275
FIELD MANUAL
it is best to define the area of core loss as the interval
heading. For example:
99.4. to 101.6: No Recovery. Interpreted to be in-
tensely fractured zone. Drillers reported blocking off,
core probably ground up during drilling.
103.4 to 103.7: Open Joint?. Drillers reported 0.3-ft
drop of drill rods during drilling and loss of all water.
Joint surfaces in core do not match.
0.7 to 11.6: Silty Sand. Poor recovery, only 6.2 ft
recovered from interval. Classification based on re-
covered material and wash samples.
0.9 to 3.2: Rockbitted. No samples recovered.
(Usually this would be subheaded under a previous
description, inferring the materials are the same as
the last recovered).
Descriptions of Surficial Deposits.—Surficial deposits
such as slope wash, alluvium, colluvium, and residual soil
that are recovered from drill holes are described using
USBR 5000 and 5005. If samples cannot be obtained,
then description of the cuttings, percent return and color
of drilling fluid, drilling characteristics, and correlation to
surface exposures is employed. Always indicate what is
being described—undisturbed samples, SPT or wash
samples, cuttings, or cores. Descriptors and descriptive
criteria for the physical characteristics of soils must
conform to the established standards. Chapter 11
provides guidelines for soil and surficial deposit
descriptions.
Extensive surficial deposits usually are described using
geologic and soil classifications. Where surficial deposits
are very shallow and not pertinent to engineering
applications for design or remediation or where geologic
276
CORE LOGGING
classification such as landslides or talus is preferable,
units may be given genetic or stratigraphic terms only.
For example, Quaternary basin fill, recent stream
channel deposit, Quaternary colluvium, zone 3
embankment, and random fill may be described
generally; or these may be unit headings with group
name subheadings. The format is:
Geologic and group name. i.e., Alluvium, (sandy
silt). Field classification in parentheses if classified,
refer to chapters 3 and 11 for exceptions.
Classification descriptions. Additional
descriptors (particle sizes, strength, consistency,
compactness, etc., from the USBR 5000 and 5005
standards descriptive criteria).
Moisture. (dry to wet).
Color.
If cores or disturbed samples are not available, describe
as many of the above items as can be determined from
cuttings, drill water color, drilling characteristics,
correlation to surface exposures, etc. Remember that for
rockbitted, no recovery, or poor recovery intervals, a
classification and group name should be assigned as a
primary identification.
Description of Rock.—Description of rock includes a
rock unit name based on general lithologic characteristics
followed by data on structural features and physical
conditions. Bedrock or lithologic units are to be delineated
and identified, not only by general rock types but by any
special geological, mineralogical features with
engineering significance, or those pertinent to
interpretation of the subsurface conditions.
277
FIELD MANUAL
Any information which is characteristic of all of the rock
units encountered normally is included under the main
heading, producing more concise logs. Differences can be
described in various subheadings. Rock core is to be
described in accordance with descriptors and descriptive
criteria presented in chapters 4 and 5. A suggested
format is:
1. Rock name — A simple descriptive name,
sufficient to provide others with possible engineering
properties of the rock type; may include geological
age and/or stratigraphic unit name.
2. Lithology (composition/grain sizes/texture/
color) — Give a brief mineralogical description.
Describe grain shape and size or sizes and texture
using textural adjectives such as vesicular,
porphyritic, schistose. (Do not use petrographic
terms such as hypidiomorphic, subidioblastic). Other
pertinent descriptions could include porosity,
absorption, physical characteristics that assist in
correlation studies, and other typical and/or unusual
properties. Provide the wet color of fresh and
weathered surfaces.
Contacts should be described here also. If the
contacts are fractured, sheared, open, or have other
significant properties, the contacts should be
identified and described under separate subheadings.
3. Bedding/foliation/flow texture — Provide a
description of thickness of bedding, banding, or
foliation including the dip or inclination of these
features.
4. Weathering/alteration — Use established de-
scriptors which apply to most of the core or use
individual subheadings. For alteration other than
278
CORE LOGGING
weathering, use appropriate descriptors. These may
or may not be separate from weathering depending
upon rock type and type of alteration. Also, include
slaking properties if the material air or water slakes.
(Weathering may be used as first or second order
headings for some logs.)
5. Hardness — Use established descriptors.
6. Discontinuities — These include shears, joints,
fractures, and contacts. Discontinuities control or
significantly influence the behavior of rock masses
and must be described in detail. Detailed discussions
of indexes and of descriptive criteria, descriptors, and
terminology for describing fractures and shears are
provided in chapter 5 and 7.
Fractures or joints should be categorized into sets if
possible, based on similar orientations, and each set
should be described. When possible, each set should
be assigned letter and/or number designations and
variations in their physical properties noted by depth
intervals. Significant individual joints also may be
identified and described. Physical measurements
such as spacing and orientation (dip or inclination
from core axis), information such as composition,
thickness, and hardness of fillings or coatings;
character of surfaces (smooth or rough); and, when
possible, fracture openness should be recorded. In
drill core, the average length between fractures is
measured along the centerline of the core for
reporting any of the fracture indexes. However,
when a set can be distinguished (parallel or
subparallel joints), true spacing is measured normal
to the fracture surfaces.
279
FIELD MANUAL
Description of Shears and Shear Zones.—Shears and
shear zones should be described in detail, including data
such as the percentage of the various components (gouge,
rock fragments, and associated features such as dikes and
veins) and the relationship of these components to each
other. Gouge color, moisture, consistency and
composition, and fragment or breccia sizes, shape, surface
features, lithology, and strengths are recorded. The
depths, dip or inclination, and true thickness, measured
normal to the shear or fault contacts, also must be
determined, if possible, along with healing, strength, and
other associated features. A thorough discussion of
shears and shear zones is contained in chapter 5.
Description of Core Loss.—The significance of core loss
is often more important than recovered core. Lost core
may represent the worst conditions for design concepts, or
it may be insignificant, resulting from improper drilling
techniques or equipment. Core losses, their intervals,
and the interpreted reason for the loss should be recorded
on the log.
Written Description Form.—The written description
for physical conditions consists of main headings,
indented subheadings, and text which describes the
important features of the core. Headings and indented
subheadings divide the core into readily distinguishable
intervals which are pertinent to an engineering geology
study. Assigned unit names should correlate with those
unit names used for surface mapping. These headings
may describe portions of the core or the entire core,
depending on how well the headings encompass overall
characteristics. Items characteristic of the entire core in
one hole may be stated under the major heading;
however, in other holes, this same information may have
to be broken out into various subheadings because it is
not applicable to the entire core. In this discussion,
280
CORE LOGGING
several logs are referenced as examples. These logs do
not necessarily reflect the established standards, and
each may be deficient in some format or context; they are
existing logs which are included as examples of different
situations which may be encountered. A discussion of
headings follows:
1. Main headings — The main heading usually
divides surficial deposits from bedrock. However,
other methods are also acceptable, for example, the
summary log in figure 10-5.
2. First order heading — The first order headings
may be based on weathering or lithology. When the
initial rock type exhibits more than one weathering
break or the lithologic properties are most
significant, lithology would be the first order
heading. Weathering may be used as first order
headings where significant. If a weathering break
coincides with a lithologic break, or only one
weathering break is present, they may both be
included in the main heading. Depending on
lithologies present, for example, if there is only one
rock type, the first order headings may be based on
fracturing. Lithology, weathering, or fracturing can
also be the subject of the first order heading. In
certain circumstances, a shear or shear zone or other
feature could be given a first order or any lower order
heading in order to emphasize a feature’s presence or
importance. The arrangement which will result in
the simplest log is usually the best and should be
used. The following examples illustrate the use of
first, second, and third order headings. These
examples are not intended to represent examples of
complete logs.
An example in which weathering is preferred as the
first order heading is:
281
FIELD MANUAL
0.0-5.0: SLOPE WASH (main heading).—General de-
scription could include the total description of the
unit.
5.0-200.0: PALEOZOIC CALAVERAS GROUP (main
heading).
5.0-100.3: Moderately Weathered (first order
heading based on weathering; descriptions of
weathering applicable to all lithologies could be
presented here).
5.0-10.9: Basalt
10.9-20.1: Limestone
20.1-50.3: Shale
50.3-100.3: Sandstone
100.3-150.0: Slightly Weathered
100.3-120.2: Sandstone
120.2-150.0: Shale
150.0-200.6: Fresh Shale
An example in which lithology is preferred as the
first-order subheading is:
0.0-5.0: SLOPE WASH (main heading).—General de-
scription, could include the total description of the
unit.
5.0-200.6: PALEOZOIC CALAVERAS GROUP (main
heading).—General description applicable to all
lithologies.
5.0-100.3: Sandstone (first order heading based on
lithology)
5.0-10.2: Intensely weathered
282
CORE LOGGING
10.2-40.1: Moderately weathered
40.1-80.2: Slightly weathered
80.2-100.3: Fresh
100.3-150.1: Fresh Shale (first order heading which
combines weathering and lithology)
150.1-200.6: Fresh Diabase
3. Second order heading — The second order
heading and the associated description contain the
char-acteristics of the rock that are unique to an
interval that is not described in the main and first
order headings. The second order heading usually is
based on weathering if the first order heading is
based on lithology. If the first order heading is based
on weathering, the second order heading would usu-
ally be based on lithology. Fracture data can be
described here if similar throughout the interval; if
not, divide fracture data into third order headings.
4. Third order heading — The third order heading
is usually based on fracture data, subordinate
features, variations in lithology, etc. This includes
variations of rock quality within a certain lithology
due to shears, joints, bedding or foliation joints, or
other discontinuities. Core recovery lengths are an
indicator of fracturing and should be described under
this heading, as in the interval from 87.2 to 101.2 in
DH-123 figure 10-1. If the fractures are mainly
prominent joint sets or other discontinuities, the
spacing and orientation of individual sets, along with
the overall fracture characteristics, should be noted.
283
FIELD MANUAL
5. Additional indentations — Additional
indentations usually are used to describe important
addi-tional subordinate features, such as veins or
veinlets, variations in lithology, shears, and zones of
non- or poor recovery.
In summary, any information consistent throughout
a higher order heading, but usually included in a
lower one, should be described in the higher order
heading to prevent repetition.
Data Required for the Comments/Explanation
Block
The comments/explanation block at the bottom of the log
form is used for additional information. This may include
abbreviations used, gauge height for packer tests, and
notes. The hole start and completion date should be in
the heading, as well as the date logged. Revision dates of
the log should be noted to ensure that the most recent
version of the log can be identified. (Date logged and any
subsequent revision dates should be entered in this
block). The computer log file name can be recorded in
this block.
Method of Reporting Orientation of Planar
Discontinuities and Structural Features
True dips can be measured directly in vertical holes. The
dips of planar features in vertical holes are recorded as
"dips 60E”or "60E dip" (see drawing 40-D-6499, figure 5-9).
True dip usually is not known in angle holes; and,
orientation is measured from the core axis and called
inclination, i.e., "Joints are inclined 45E from the core
axis" (figure 5-9). If dips are known from oriented core or
other surveys, dips may be recorded instead of inclination
284
CORE LOGGING
in angle holes. Figure 5-9 demonstrates how misinter-
pretations can occur; the inclination of a joint in the core
from a 45E inclined angle hole can be interpreted as a
horizontal joint or as a vertical joint by rotating the core.
Core Recovery and Core Losses
Descriptions of core in the Classification and Physical
Condition column should describe the recovered core, not
only by physical measurements (maximum, minimum,
and mostly range or average), but should identify and
include the interpretation for any core losses, especially
if the losses are thought to represent conditions different
from the core recovered. Designers and other users of the
completed log can incorporate into their design all the
factual data that are seen and recorded. What is not seen
or reported (core losses) is more difficult to incorporate
into the design and may well be the most significant
information. Also, core losses and interpretations of the
reasons for their loss are significant engineering data
that may correlate open joints, soft zones, or shears from
boring to boring or from surface features to the
subsurface explorations.
Core losses can result from three generalized conditions:
inaccurate measurements by the drillers; poor drilling
techniques, equipment, and handling; or geologic
conditions. The geologist, using the depth of hole,
recovered core, observations of the core, and drillers
observations, is the individual to make interpretations of
the core loss. All core should be measured by the logger.
If using a split-tube barrel, the core should be measured
while in the barrel and always after core segments are
fitted together (using the midpoint of core ends). Unac-
countable losses should be reconciled, and the location of
the loss determined.
285
FIELD MANUAL
Tape checks or rod checks are the most reliable and pre-
ferred methods for knowing the exact location of geologic
conditions (top of each run is known with certainty) and
where losses occur. All core runs should be measured and
recorded; gains and losses can be transferred to adjacent
runs and cancel out each other during the process of
determining where the core loss is located. Inaccurate
drillers’ measurements, or locations where portions of the
previously drilled interval was left in the hole (pulled off,
or fell back in and redrilled), can be determined by
examining and matching the end and beginning of each
core run to see if they fit together or show signs of being
redrilled. Gains may be attributed to pulling out the
bottom of the hole, mismeasurement, recovering core left
in the hole from the previous run, or recovery of
expansive, slaking, or stress relieving materials.
Where unaccountable losses occur, the examination of
core to determine the reason for that loss is critical. Poor
drilling methods (excessive pressure, speed, excessive
water discharge from the drill bit, not stopping when fluid
return plugs), inaccurate measurements, or geologic
conditions responsible for core losses should be
determined. Core may have spun in the barrel after
blocking; an intensely fractured zone may have been
ground up; or a shear zone, open joint(s), solution cavity,
or joint fillings may have been washed away. Geologic
interpretation of the core loss is based on examining
recovered core and the fractures present in the core. Drill
water losses and color or changes in the drilling
conditions noted by the driller may suggest an
interpretation of the core loss. Where losses occur near a
recovered clay "seam," clay coats fracture surfaces,
slickensides and/or breccia and gouge are present, the
core loss may be interpreted as a shear or shear zone.
The description should include all the factual
information—discontinuity surface orientations,
slickensides, coatings, gouge and/or fractures; and the
286
CORE LOGGING
interpretation that the loss occurred in a shear.
Depending on the confidence in the interpretation based
on the observed conditions, the description can be given
as "shear," or "shear?," or "probable shear zone." When a
portion of a shear zone has been lost during drilling, the
no recovery zone should be described as part of the shear
and the loss or part of the loss included in the shear's
thickness.
Samples
If the geologist selects representative or special samples
for laboratory testing, an appropriate space should be left
in the core box to ensure that when logs are reviewed or
photographs are taken, core recovery is not misleading.
Either filler blocks or a spacer which indicates the top
and bottom depths of the sample and a sample number
can be used to fill the sample space. For N-size cores, a
length of 2- by 2-inch (50- by 50-mm) block or other
spacers that fill the tray work well. These blocks also
should be used to separate core runs. The lettering on
the blocks should be easily readable at a distance. Spray
painting the blocks white or yellow and lettering them
with black waterproof pens enhances visibility and
legibility. The sample interval, and sample number if
desired, must be recorded in the Samples for Testing
column on the log. Portions of the core may be preserved
as representative samples or to protect samples from
slaking or other deterioration.
287
FIELD MANUAL
Core Photography
General Photographic Methods
Transmittal of core photographs with the final logs is rec-
ommended. The photos may be included in the data
package or as an appendix to the data report. Cores
should be photographed while fresh. Before and after
photographs of materials that slake or stress-relieve are
recommended. The importance of photographing the core
before it has been disturbed in transit and before its
moisture content has changed cannot be overemphasized.
If proper precautions during transport are followed, and
the core is logged in a timely manner, reasonably good
photographs can be obtained away from the drilling site.
This permits the labeling of core features, if desired.
If possible, cores should be photographed in both color
and black and white at 8- by 10-inch (200- by 250-mm)
size. Black and white photographs do not degrade over
time like color photographs. Core photographs should be
submitted with the final logs in the geology data report;
color photographs are best for data analysis.
Many methods are employed for photographing core.
Each box of core can be photographed separately as the
box is first filled or three or more boxes can be
photographed at a time. There are advantages to both
procedures:
• Greater detail and photographs depicting fresher
conditions are the major advantages of photo-
graphing each box individually.
• When photographing several boxes at a time,
transitional features, changes in weathering or
fracturing, or large shear zones can be seen in one
photograph.
288
CORE LOGGING
The best method is a combination of the two. Pictures of
individual boxes at the drill site and later pictures of the
entire hole are the best of two worlds.
Individual Box Photography
Any portion of core that is in danger of altering or disag-
gregating because of slaking or "discing" due to stress
relief, expansion, or shrinkage due to changes in moisture
or confinement because of down time, ends of shifts, or
weekends must be boxed and photographed. Under these
circumstances, the core should be photographed while at
or near the material natural condition (even if a box is
only partially filled).
Each photograph should be taken from approximately the
same distance so that the scale of each photograph is
identical. The box should fill the frame of the camera,
thereby obtaining the highest quality resolution or core
detail, and the camera should be held as close to normal
to the core as possible. A tripod should be used if
possible. Tilting the core box and, if necessary, standing
in a pickup bed or other vantage point may be helpful.
Most core boxes can be tilted about 70 to 80E before any
core is in danger of spilling out, so very little additional
height is required. A simple 2- by 4-foot (0.6- by 1.2-m)
wood frame may be constructed, or the core box may be
leaned against a tool box, pickup tailgate, or other stable
object. A Brunton compass can be used to ensure that the
box and the camera are placed at a consistent, uniform
angle. Shadows should be eliminated as much as
possible.
All core should be photographed both wet and dry. In hot
or dry weather, the unphotographed boxed core should be
covered by moist cloth. When ready to photograph, any
dry zones should be touched up using a wet cloth or
289
FIELD MANUAL
paintbrush. In extremely hot weather, the boxed core can
be sprayed or sprinkled with water. A water hose, garden
sprayer, or spray bottle works well for this operation.
Wait for the water to be absorbed so that there is no
objectionable sheen or glare-producing film of water on
the core at the instant of film exposure.
A labeled lid, letter board, or another frame which shows
feature, drill hole number, photograph, or core box
number, and depths of the top and bottom of the cored
interval should be included in the photograph. A scale in
feet and/or tenths of a foot or meters is helpful.
Photographing Multiple Boxes
As soon as possible after the core is removed from the
barrel and boxed, the core should be photographed. To
facilitate the photography, construct a frame capable of
supporting three or more boxes at a time for use at the
drill yard or core storage yard. Photograph the core dry
then spray with water to bring back the natural moisture
color. The same precautions about glare referred to
previously should be followed.
A frame which shows the project, feature, hole number,
box __ of __boxes, and from—to, as a minimum, should be
used for the photograph. Other optional but
recommended entries may include date photographed,
and a scale.
Special Circumstances
Special photography such as closeups of shear zones or
other special features may be worthwhile. When these
photographs are taken, a common object or scale should
be included to provide the viewer with relative or actual
dimensions.
290
CORE LOGGING
When cores are coated with drill mud, a brush, wet rag,
or pocket knife should be used to wash or scrape off the
mud so that materials are their natural color and features
of the core are not obscured. This step obviously must be
taken prior to logging the material.
Photograph Overlays
Acetate or mylar overlays on photographs of core can help
interpretation of exposed features. Details shown may
include labels for shears, weathering, lithologies, or items
of special interest. Other items that may be shown on
overlays are joint sets, and they may be coded by an alpha
or numeric character or by colored ink.

FIELD MANUAL
Instruction to Drillers, Daily Drill Reports, and
General Drilling Procedures
Communication between the geologist and driller is
extremely important. Establishment of lines of
communication, both orally and in writing, is key to a
successful exploration program.
The role of the geologist in the drilling program is as an
equal partner with the driller at the drill site.
Establishment of this partnership at the beginning of the
drilling program will result in better data. Failure to
establish a good working relationship with the drill crew
often results in unanswered questions and a poor quality
end product. One way to establish good working rapport
is to keep the drillers informed and to plan with them.
Drill Hole Plan
A suggested method for ensuring that a clear
understanding of what the drilling requirements and
expectations are from the drill hole is the preparation of
a drill hole plan. The plan is prepared prior to starting
the hole and after the geologist has used available
interpretive data and has determined whether special
testing and procedures or deviations in standard practice
are required. This document provides the driller with
information about safety, special site conditions, purpose
of the hole, procedures to be followed, water testing
requirements, materials expected to be recovered, any
special sampling or geophysical testing required, and hole
completion requirements.
Guidelines for Drillers
The following guidelines provide a framework for
preparing written instructions for drill crews or for
294
CORE LOGGING
contract drill specifications. Also, the guidelines serve to
help geologists correct poor drilling procedures, collect
additional data, or improve core handling and logging.
Drill Setup.—To ensure that drill holes are completed at
the desired location and along the correct bearing and
plunge, the use of aiming stakes and a suitable device for
measuring angles should be provided by the geologist and
used by the drill crews. Drillers should use aiming stakes
set by the geologist or survey crew for the specified
bearing of the drill hole. The rig must be anchored
properly so that it will not shift. If stakes have been
removed or knocked over, they should be replaced by the
geologist. Also, drillers must ensure the hole is drilled at
the designated angle. The geologist should check the
plunge angle with Brunton compass, and/or the drillers
should use an appropriate measuring device.
Daily Drill Reports Preparation.—The drillers should
prepare duplicate daily drill reports using carbon paper
(additional copies of each report may be required on
contract rigs). All copies must be legible and preferably
printed. One copy should be provided to the geologist for
monitoring progress and for preparation of the geologic
log. The drill report has a space opposite each run for
each item of information required; each of these spaces
need to be filled out completely. Data should be added to
the report or recorded in a notebook after each run.
Drillers should record data as it occurs. See
drawing 40-D-6484 (figure 10-6) as an example for
reporting daily drill activities. Many field offices have
local forms on which these data can be recorded.
Comments regarding specific items to be recorded on the
daily reports are contained in the following paragraphs.
1. Recording depths and core loss — Check for
agreement on depths for intervals drilled by
295
FIELD MANUAL
consecutive shifts. Depths should be recorded in feet
and tenths of feet or to the nearest centimeter, as
appropriate. Tape checks or rod checks may be
required at change of shift or more frequently when
requested by the geologist. The section entitled
“Core Recovery and Core Losses” contains
instructions for proper use of core measurements,
filler blocks (spacers), and tape checks. The driller is
responsible for knowing the depth of the barrel and
the hole at all times. Discrepancies between
intervals drilled and recovery need to be resolved.
Only standard length drill rods should be used. Core
should be measured while it is still in the inner
barrel and after it is placed in the core box.
Record the most correct measurement of the two in
the report. In the event core is left in the hole, the
next run should be shortened accordingly; the left
amount and proper hole entry and startup
procedures should be followed to facilitate recovery.
2. Recording drilling conditions — Make sure
drilling conditions, such as fast or slow, hard or soft,
rough or smooth, even or erratic, moderately fast or
very slow, bit blocks off, etc., are indicated for each
run. Record time in minutes per foot (meter) of
penetration. Any changes in the drilling rate within
a run also should be noted along with intervals of
caving or raveling. If the bit becomes plugged or
blocking off is suspected, the driller should stop
drilling and pull the core barrel. Also, when drill
circulation is lost, the driller should pull and ex-
amine the core.
3. Drilling fluid return and color — The type,
color, and estimated percent of drilling fluids
returned should be recorded for each core run. The
depth of changes in fluid loss or color is particularly
296
CORE LOGGING
important. If drilling mud is used, indicate number
of sacks used per shift. In case of total loss of drilling
fluid, it may be necessary to pressure test the
interval.
4. Description of core — Drillers need to describe
the core in general terms; i.e., moderately hard, very
hard, soft, clay seams, broken, color, etc. If familiar
with the rock types, drillers may report more than
just general terminology.
5. Water-pressure testing — Holes in rock are typi-
cally water tested in 10-foot (3-m) intervals at
pressures of approximately ½ lb/in2 (3.5 kilopascals
[kPa]) to 1 lb/in2 (6.90 kPa) per foot (1/3 m) of cover
up to 100 lb/in2 (690 kPa). NOTE: Pressures may be
modified for each site. Factors such as density of
materials, "overburden pressure" or "cover," bedding,
purpose of testing, distances from free faces, water
levels, and artesian pressures all must be taken into
account so that pressure testing does not
unintentionally hydrofracture the foundation or jack
foundation materials. Pressures should be
determined by the geologist. If a range of pressures
is used, and disproportionately high water losses are
obtained at the higher pressures, the pressures
should be stepped down and water losses at the
lower pressures recorded. Water test pressures
should be stepped up 3 to 5 times and then stepped
down. Flow versus pressure should be plotted; and
if the relationship is not linear or smoothly curved,
hydrofracturing or jacking may be occurring. If the
decreasing pressure curve does not follow the
increasing pressure curve, washing, plugging, or
hydrofracturing or jacking may be occurring without
the foundation materials returning to the prewater
test state. Intentionally increasing the pressure
until the foundation is fractured or jacked is a good
297
FIELD MANUAL
way to determine appro-priate grout pressures.
Gravity tests, overlapping pressure tests, and
variations in the length of the interval tested may be
used to ensure complete test data. For example, a
packer interval of 8 feet (2.4 m) may be used if the
hole is caving too badly to get 10 feet (3 m) of open
hole. Also, if a packer will not seat at 10 feet (3 m)
above the bottom of the hole and there is good rock at
12 feet (3.66 m), a 12-foot test interval may be used.
If losses are above 15 gal/min (1.146 liters per
second [L/sec]), exceed pump or system capacity, or
water is known to be bypassing the packer, reduce
the length of the packer interval and retest.
Losses should be recorded in gallons and tenths of
gal/min (L/sec). The driller should record the water
meter reading at 1-minute intervals, and the test
should be run for a full 5 minutes at each pressure
increment after the flow has stabilized. The driller
should report the average flow in gal/min (L/sec) for
the 5-minute test. Each driller should keep his own
record of the packer data in case questions arise
concerning the testing. A suggested form for
recording data is shown in figure 10-7.
6. Casing or cementing depths — The depth of the
casing or the cemented interval should be shown for
each core run. Do not cement any more of the hole
than is necessary to repair a caving or raveling
interval. The use of additives such as calcium
chloride or aluminum powder, if permitted, will
reduce the set time. These materials should be
added to the water and not to the cement.
7. Recording unusual conditions — All unusual
conditions or events should be noted in the "Notes"
298
299
CORE
LOGGING
Figure 10-7.—Water testing record.
FIELD MANUAL
column of the report. This includes such items as
sudden changes in drilling speed, loss of circulation,
drop of drill string (open joints or cavities), casing
and cementing procedures, caving, squeezing, packer
failures, and gas.
8. Recording setups, drilling, and downtime —
Time must be noted on reverse side of report. Type,
number, and size of bit is indicated here also.
9. Recording water level measurements —
Measurement should be recorded at the start of each
day shift and shown on the day shift report. Holes
should be jetted or bailed prior to completion of the
hole to obtain reliable water level data. Immediately
after jetting or bailing, the depth to water should be
recorded.
10. Care of core and core boxes — Split-tube
(triple tube) core barrels should be used. If not used,
the core should not be damaged when extracted from
the core barrel. Do not beat on the barrel with a
metal hammer; use a rubber mallet/hammer or a
piece of wood. The best way to remove core from a
solid barrel is by using a pump to pressurize the
inside of the barrel and extrude the core (stand
back!). The mud pump will work satisfactorily for
this. Core should be extracted from the inner tube
and carefully placed into core boxes by hand. The
use of cardboard or plastic halfrounds is
recommended (see figure 10-8. Core pieces should
be fitted into the core box and fragments should
be arranged to save space. Long pieces may
be broken for better fit in the core box, but
a line should be drawn across the core to
denote mechanical breaks. If 5-foot (1.5-m) core
300
CORE LOGGING
Figure 10-8.—Use of half-round to protect core.
301
FIELD MANUAL
boxes are used, mechanical breaks to fit 5-foot runs
in boxes are reduced. Figure 10-9 shows a typical
core box for N-size core.
Core should be placed in the core box from left to
right, with the top to the left, bottom to the right,
starting at the top of the box so the core reads like a
book. The ends and top of the box should be marked
with black enamel paint or indelible felt pen. Core
blocks, which mark the depths, are placed between
each run and the depth marked. Data on the outside
of the left end of the box should include the project,
feature, drill hole number, box number, and depth
interval in the box.
Filler blocks (spacers) are necessary to properly
record information and minimize disturbance to the
core during handling. Blocks should be placed with
a planed side marked with either black enamel paint
or indelible felt-tip pen; 2- by 2-inch (50- by 50-mm)
blocks work well for N-size core. All core runs must
be separated with blocks properly labeled at the top
and bottom of the run. Sample intervals should be
marked in the boxes using wooden blocks of lengths
equal to the missing core so that the sample may be
returned to the box. Gaps for core losses should not
be left in the core box. Core left in the hole and
recovered on the next run may be added to the
previous run. Filler blocks inserted where
unaccountable core losses occur should show the
length of loss in tenths of feet, as follows: LC (lost
core) 0.3 foot, or NR (no recovery) 0.3 foot. The core
loss block indicates that a certain length of core was
unaccountably lost within a run, and the block
should be placed at the depth of the core loss. If
the point of core loss cannot be determined, the block
can be placed in the core box at the bottom of
302
303
CORE
LOGGING

FIELD MANUAL
304
CORE LOGGING
the run, preceding the bottom of run block. Cavities
may be marked on the block. All spacer, sample,
and core loss blocks should be nailed to the bottom
or sides of the box to prevent movement of the core.
At the drill site, core boxes should be lined up,
preferably on boards or planks, in order from top to
bottom, with labels and up side to left, in a safe area
and kept covered with lids. While in the field, do
not place boxes where sliding or caving of slopes is
likely to occur and keep out of the way of vehicles
and equipment. Core boxes, especially those
containing soft, slaking, or intensely fractured core
material, should be covered immediately to prevent
damage by rain or drying. Tray partitions in boxes
should be nailed so that nails do not protrude from
bottom of boxes.
When the core is moved, be careful to prevent
disturbance, breakage, or spilling. Damage to the
core during transportation can be minimized by
using nailed-down spacers and a 3/4- to 1-inch thick
(19-25-mm) foam-rubber pad placed between the top
of the core and the secured core box lid.
Hole Completion.—Completion of the drill hole should
meet the requirements established by the exploration
program and at the direction of the field geologist. Drill
holes usually will be completed either with sufficient
casing or plastic pipe to assure that the hole will stay
open for later water level observations. In areas where
vandalism may occur or when long-term monitoring is
contemplated, a standpipe and suitable cap with lock
should be installed. Completion information should be
indicated on the driller's report. The drill hole number
should be stamped or welded into the casing. If
groundwater observation riser pipes have been installed,
305
FIELD MANUAL
install a minimum 3-foot (1-m) length of surface casing
with a locking cap as a standpipe to mark the drill hole
and protect the riser pipe. Grouted in place, this
standpipe can also serve to protect the observation well
from infiltration by surface runoff.
Concrete Core Logging
Concrete structures are commonly cored to assess the
quality of concrete or as part of foundation investigations
on existing features. An early macroscopic assessment
of concrete core is warranted for the following reasons:
• Concrete physical condition may suggest changes
in the drilling program or sampling techniques
that would be difficult to modify after drilling is
complete. A different approach in drilling or
sampling techniques may be necessary to
determine the cause of distress or failure.
• Shipping, handling, and sample preparation may
modify the concrete core by inducing, modifying,
or masking fractures or causing core
disintegration.
• Core could be lost or destroyed before reaching
the laboratory.
• Macroscopic examination may provide the
required information eliminating the need for a
petrographic examination.
This section is based on American Society for Testing
Materials Designations (ASTM) C 823-83 and C 856-83.
Purposes of Examination.—Investigations of in-
service concrete conditions are usually done
to: (a) determine the ability of the concrete to perform
306
CORE LOGGING
satisfactorily under anticipated conditions for future
service; (b) identify the processes or materials causing
distress or failure; (c) discover conditions in the concrete
that caused or contributed to satisfactory performance or
failure; (d) establish methods for repair or replacement
without recurrence of the problem; (e) determine
conformance to construction specification requirements;
(f) evaluate the performance of the components in the
concrete; and (g) develop data for fixing financial and
legal responsibility.
In addition to the usual drill log information, the
following should be provided, if available:
• Reason for and objectives of the coring program.
• Location and original orientation of each core.
• Conditions of operation and service exposure.
• Age of the structure.
• Results of field tests, such as velocity and
rebound or Schmidt hammer data.
Figure 10-10 is an example of a drill hole log showing the
types of information that can be shown and a format for
a log showing both rock and concrete core.
Examination.—Concrete core is commonly marked in
the field showing the top and bottom depths at the
appropriate ends and at any of the following features.
Below are listed the major items to examine and record:
Fractures — Cracks or fractures in core are best
seen on smooth surfaces and can be accented by
wetting and partial drying of the surface. Old crack
surfaces are often different colors than fresh
fracture
307
CORE LOGGING
Figure 10-10.—Log of concrete and rock core.
307
CORE LOGGING
surfaces. Old fracture surfaces often have reaction
products or alteration of the surfaces. Fractures
often follow structural weaknesses.
Reacted particles — Rims on gravel or sand are
often caused by weathering processes unless other
factors indicate chemical reactions with the cement
paste. Crushed aggregate with rims probably is due
to chemical reaction with the cement paste.
Reaction products — Crushed aggregate with rims
usually indicates alteration in the concrete, such as
alkali-silica reaction or alkali-carbonate reaction.
Rims in paste bordering coarse aggregate and light
colored areas in the paste may be gel-soaked or
highly carbonated paste adjoining carbonate
aggregate that has undergone an alkali-carbonate
reaction. White areas of fairly hard, dry material or
soft, wet material that has fractured and penetrated
the concrete and aggregate or fills air voids should
be recorded. Alkali aggregate reaction products can
be differentiated from calcium carbonate deposits by
using hydrocloric acid. The reaction products do not
fizz.
Changes in size or type of fine and coarse
aggregate — Sizes, shapes, and types of aggregate
can vary in a structure due to changes in mixes,
placement procedure, or sources and should be
logged.
Voids — Voids (honeycomb, popcorn) are indicators
of trapped air, inadequate vibration, or insufficient
mortar to effectively fill the spaces among coarse
aggregate particles. Voids should be described and
the volume percent estimated.
309
FIELD MANUAL
Segregation of components — Concrete compo-
nents can become segregated or concentrated during
placement. Large aggregate sizes can separate from
fine aggregate, and paste can separate from the
aggregate, especially near forms or finished
surfaces.
Cold joints or lift lines — Weak joints or zones
can form in concrete due to long periods between
buckets or mixer loads. Poor vibration or poor or
improper preparation of previous lift surfaces can
form zones of weakness or actual planes similar to
joints in rock. These surfaces, called lift lines,
should be described and any material on the
surfaces described. Lift lines can be very subtle and
difficult to locate. Design or construction data often
provide clues as to where to look for lift lines and
construction joints. The core should be examined
wet. Clues to lift line locations are: (1) aligned
aggregate along the surfaces each side of a line,
(2) coarser aggregate above the lift line than is below
the line, (3) different shape, gradation, or
composition of aggregate above and below the lift
line, (4) a thin line of paste on the lift line, and
(5) no aggregate crosses the lift line.
Steel or other imbedded items — Reinforcing steel
and orientations should be described as well as other
materials encountered such as timber, steel lagging,
dirt, or cooling pipes.
Changes in color of the cement — Changes in
paste color can indicate reaction products or changes
in cement type or cement sources and should be
logged.
Aggregate-paste bond — The bond between the
aggregate and cement should be described. A good
bond is characterized by concrete breaking through
310
CORE LOGGING
the aggregate and not around the particles. A fair
bond is characterized by concrete breaking through
and around the aggregate. A poor bond has concrete
breaking around the aggregate.
Aggregate rock type — The aggregate rock type
can be important in determining the causes of
concrete problems. For example, limestone often
has chert inclusions suggesting an aggregate
reaction, whereas an igneous rock such as granite
probably will not react with cement. Both the coarse
and fine aggregate should be examined.
Aggregate shape — Aggregate shape is usually
unique to each source. Rounded or subrounded
aggregate is probably natural. Angular (sharp)
aggregate is probably crushed.
Mechanical breaks — Mechanical breaks in the
core and whether the break is around or through the
aggregate should be noted.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR
LOGGING SOILS
General
All subsurface investigations of soils for construction
materials and for most engineering purposes using test
pits, trenches, auger holes, drill holes, or other
exploratory methods should be logged and described
using the standards in USBR 5000 [1] and 5005 [1]
(Unified Soil Classification System [USCS]) in accordance
with the established descriptive criteria and descriptors
presented in chapter 3 and the guidelines presented in
this section.
All investigations associated with land classification for
irrigation suitability, as well as data collection and
analyses of soil and materials related to drainage inves-
tigations, should be logged and described using the
U.S. Department of Agriculture terminology outlined in
appendix I to Agriculture Handbook No. 436 (Soil
Taxonomy), dated December 1975 [2].
Test pits and auger holes may be logged on a form
(figure 11-1), or logs may be computer generated. For
metric design studies and specifications, information is to
be in metric units. For specifications using English units,
the written soil description should use metric units for
the description of soil particle sizes (millimeters instead
of inches). Example word descriptions are shown in
figures 11-2 through 11-11.

Formats for Test Pits and Auger Hole Logs
General Instructions
The following subsection provides general instructions for
log format and descriptions. Refer to chapter 3 for
descriptive criteria, classification, and group names and
symbols.
• Capitalize the group name. If cobbles and boulders are
present, include them in the typical name.
• Describe plasticity of fines as:
“approximately 30 percent (%) fines with high
plasticity”
“approximately 60% fines with low to medium
plasticity”
“approximately 10% nonplastic fines”
• Give results of hand tests when performed.
• Use “reaction with hydrochloric acid (HCl).”
• Do not give unnecessary information such as “no odor,”
“no gravel,” and “no fines.”
However, the negative result of a hand test is positive in-
formation and should be reported as “no dilatancy,”
“nonplastic,” “no dry strength,” or “no reaction with HCl.”
For reporting maximum particle size, use the following:
Fine sand
Medium sand
Coarse sand
5-millimeter (mm) increments from 5 mm to 75 mm
25-mm increments from 75 mm to 300 mm
100-mm increments over 300 mm
325
FIELD MANUAL
For example, “maximum particle size 35 mm” or
“maximum particle size 400 mm” are the correct format
and size increment.
Table 11-1 is a checklist for log descriptors. Format for
descriptions, results, and other information are in the
following subsections.

Reporting by Method of Classification
Preparation of Logs Based on Visual Classifica-
tion.—List fines, sand, and gravel in descending order of
percent (must add up to 100 percent). For visual classi-
fication, estimate percentages to the closest 5 percent.
Precede the estimated percentages with “approx.,” not
“about.” If a component is present but is less than
5 percent of the total, use “trace.” “Trace” is not included
in the 100 percent.
Preparation of Logs Based on Laboratory Classifi-
cation.—When logs are prepared using laboratory
classifications (based on laboratory tests), the information
must be presented on the log as shown in figure 11-4.
The difference between a laboratory and a visual
classification is depicted in figure 11-6.
The visual classification should not be changed, nor
should the estimated percentages, plasticity description,
or the results of the hand tests (dry strength, dilatancy,
and toughness) be changed to reflect laboratory tests
results. The visual classification is based on the total
material observed; whereas, the laboratory classification
is based on a representative sample of the material.

FIELD MANUAL
The specimens for testing are to be samples that repre-
sent the entire interval being described (see USBR 7000
and 7010 [1]). The material collected must be split or
quartered to obtain the specimen that is to be tested in
the laboratory.
Coefficients of uniformity and curvature (C and C) are
u c
to be calculated and reported on the logs for coarse-
grained materials containing 12 percent or less fines.
Laboratory gradation percentages and Atterberg limits
are to be reported to the nearest whole number.
Procedures for Reporting Laboratory Data in Addi-
tion to Visual Classification and Description.—In
some instances, gradation analyses and Atterberg limit
tests are performed on soil samples in conjunction with
preparation of logs of test pits or auger holes. These data
should be shown on the logs and clearly identified as
laboratory test data.
Specimens for testing are to be from samples that
represent the entire interval being described. If this is
not possible, the location of the sample should be given as
part of the word description. The sample taken should be
split or quartered to get the specimen size required for
testing (figure 11-5, interval 0.0 to 9.8 feet (ft).
Laboratory test data are to be presented in a separate
paragraph. If the test results indicate a different classi-
fication, and therefore different group symbol and/or
group name than the visual classification, give the
laboratory classification symbol and name in this
paragraph (figure 11-6).
330
LOGGING SOILS
Note: For logs which incorporate the test
results, the statement “Classification by
laboratory” should be placed in the “Remarks”
portion of the log.
Coefficients of uniformity and curvature (C and C) are
u c
to be calculated and reported on the logs for coarse-
grained materials containing 12 percent or less fines.
All laboratory gradation percentages and Atterberg limits
are to be reported to the nearest whole number.
Reporting Undisturbed (In-Place) Conditions
List in-place conditions on logs of test pits in a separate
paragraph (figure 11-7). Do not give in-place soil condi-
tions (consistency, compactness) on auger hole logs
(unless the holes are large enough to inspect). Instead,
describe difficulty of augering (figure 11-8). Also describe
caving or any other unusual occurrences during drilling
of the auger hole.
In-place density tests are often performed in test pits or
trenches. When a large quantity of logs are reviewed,
density information on the log can save time, even though
additional time is required for preparation of the log.
Results of in-place density tests that are performed in
test pits or trenches are to be included on the log in the
descriptive paragraph on in-place conditions, as
illustrated in figure 11-10.
Results of any laboratory compaction tests (Proctor, mini-
mum and maximum density) performed on the material
from the in-place density tests or from the pit or trench
are to be included on the log.
331
FIELD MANUAL
For pipeline investigations, the percent of the maximum
dry density or the percent relative density should be in
parentheses on the logs (figure 11-10).
Densities are reported to the nearest 0.1 pound per cubic
foot (lb/ft3) or 1 kilogram per cubic meter (kg/m3).
Moisture content is reported to the nearest 0.1 percent.
Percent of laboratory maximum dry density or relative
density is reported to the nearest whole number.
Geologic Interpretations
Geologic interpretations should be made by or under the
supervision of a geologist. Give geologic interpretation in
a separate paragraph (figure 11-7). Interpretation should
also be included in the narrative section of the materials
portion of the design data submittals.
Description Formats on Test Pit and Auger Hole
Logs for Soils with Cobbles and Boulders
If the soil has less than 50 percent cobbles and boulders
(by volume), give the group name of the minus 75-mm
portion and include cobbles and/or boulders in the group
name (figure 11-11). Use two paragraphs to describe soil.
Refer to chapter 3 for a more complete discussion of
classification and classification group names and symbols.
• Describe the minus 75-mm fraction in the first para-
graph. These component percentages are estimated by
weight.
• Describe the total sample in a second paragraph. These
percentages are estimated by volume. Even if the
percentage of cobbles and boulders is determined by
measurement, use “approx.” in the word description.
332
LOGGING SOILS
If the soil has more than 50 percent cobbles and boulders
(by volume), list cobbles and boulders first in the name
(figure 11-13). Do not give a group symbol or group name.
• Describe the total sample in the first paragraph.
Percentages are estimated by volume.
• Describe the minus 75-mm fraction in a second
paragraph. Percentages are estimated by weight.
Angular particles larger than 75 mm are described as cob-
bles and boulders, not as rock fragments. A description
of their shape should be provided in the word description.
Description of Materials Other than Natural Soils
Materials which are not natural soils are not described or
classified in the same manner as natural soils. The
section titled “Use of Soil Classification as Secondary
Identification Methods for Materials other than Natural
Soils”, chapter 3, outlines the criteria to be followed and
provides example descriptions for test pit and auger hole
logs. Refer to appropriate sections in chapter 3 for
example format and descriptions. Figures 11-14 through
11-17 show a variety of logs of test pits and auger holes
reflecting miscellaneous conditions.
Format of Word Descriptions for
Drill Hole Logs
The descriptions of surficial deposits and soil-like
materials in geologic logs of exploration holes should use
similar descriptive criteria and format established for test
pits and auger holes except as noted in the following
paragraphs.

Exceptions to Test Pit and Auger Hole
Format and Descriptions for Drill Hole Logs
Unlike test pit logs where geologic interpretations may be
provided at the bottom of the log form, geologic inter-
pretations are required on drill hole logs. The geologic
classification (e.g., Quaternary Alluvium, Quaternary
Glacial Outwash, Quaternary Landslide, Tertiary Basin
Fill Deposits) should be provided as main headings on the
geological drill hole log.
Group names are capitalized in all test pit and auger hole
logs. Where capitalization of the group name would
conflict with main headings on drill hole logs, capitalize
only the first letter of each word of the group name and
the group symbol. If the first letter of each word is not
capitalized, the group name is considered informal usage
only and not a classification.
Classification and word description format for drill hole
logs is similar to those used for test pit logs. Also,
materials recovered from drill holes are generally
considered to represent in-place conditions. These
criteria do not apply when samples are not recovered or
when poor recovery precludes classification (figure 11-18).
Samples Recovered from Wash Borings or as
Cuttings
When drill holes are advanced with a rock bit, water jet,
or other nonsampling methods, a group symbol and name
or classification of the recovered materials should not be
assigned, nor should in-place descriptions, such as
consistency, be used. However, descriptive criteria, such
as particle size, dry strength, and reaction with HCl,
should be provided using the same terminology and
format used for auger holes.
339
340
FIELD
MANUAL
Figure 11-18.—Drill hole advanced by tri-cone rock bit.
LOGGING SOILS
Descriptions should be preceded by “Recovered cuttings
as . . .” or “Recovered wash samples as. . .” (figure 11-18,
interval 0.0-11.7 ft.
Poor or Partial Recovery
Where poor or partial recovery precludes accurate classi-
fication, a primary classification should not be assigned,
but as much descriptive information as possible should be
provided. Recovered materials, together with drilling
conditions, cuttings, and drilling fluid color or losses, may
be used to interpret reasons for losses and types of
materials lost. However, an appropriate subheading (i.e.,
“Poor Recovery”) should be used (figure 11-19, 2.1 to
3.9 ft.
Materials Other Than Soils and Special Cases
As discussed in chapter 3, “Use of Soil Classification as
Secondary Identification Methods for Materials Other
Than Natural Soils,” exceptions to the test pit and hole
classification and format are also applicable to hole logs.
These special cases include processed or manmade
materials, shells, partially lithified or poorly cemented
materials and decomposed bedrock, and shallow surficial
deposits or soils. Other special categories of soil-like
materials should be classified by USBR 5000 or
USBR 5005[1]. These are soil-like slide-failure zones or
planes; shear or fault zones; bedrock units which are
recovered as soil-like material or consist of soil-like
material; and landslides and talus (figures 11-20, 11-21,
and 11-22).
Format and classification for these exceptions are
described below.

FIELD MANUAL
Processed or Manmade Materials.—Surficial deposits
such as tailings, crushed rock, shells, or slag are assigned
a genetic name such as filter, bedding, drain material,
shells, tailings, or road base, and a classification group
name and symbol are assigned in quotation marks, for
example: Filter material, “poorly graded sand (SP-SM).”
Soil descriptors are then used to describe the materials.
Where drill holes penetrate embankment materials, main
headings on the drill hole logs should be a classification
of the type of embankment, such as “Zone 3
Miscellaneous Embankment.” The materials recovered in
each interval are classified, and group names and
symbols are provided as subheadings. See 1.0- to 3.9-ft
and 3.9- to 15.4-ft intervals shown in figure 11-19.
Partially Lithified or Poorly Cemented Materials
and Decomposed Rock.—Descriptions of partially
lithified or poorly cemented materials such as siltstone,
claystone, sandstone, and shale or decomposed rock which
are broken down during drilling or field classification
testing should be classified by an appropriate rock unit
name or by geologic formation name, if known, of the in-
place materials. The materials are then described using
descriptors for rock (chapter 4). A soil classification for
the broken down materials should be reported in
quotation marks on the drill logs and all figures, tables,
drawings, or narrative descriptions. The disaggregating
mechanism (e.g., drilling or testing) should be specified
(figure 11-22, interval 17.3 to 67.9 ft).
Shallow Surficial Deposits.—Surficial deposits such as
drill pad or dozer trench fill for drill setups, shallow slope
wash, or topsoil materials which will not be used in, or
influence, design or construction may be classified by
genetic classification (e.g., “fill,” “slopewash,” or “topsoil”).
Complete classification descriptions are not required on
drill hole logs; however, a classification name and/or
346
LOGGING SOILS
symbol may be assigned and is often desirable. Although
a complete description is not required on each log, an
adequate description of these materials should be
provided in a general legend or explanation drawing and
in the narrative of the report, if not completely described
in drill hole logs.
Slide Failure Zones or Planes, Shear or Fault
Zones, and Interbeds Recovered as Soil-like
Materials.—These features should be described using
geologic names as well as behavior and soil
classifications.
Landslides and Talus.—Surficial deposits such as
landslides and talus should be assigned their genetic
geologic name in the main headings of the drill hole log.
Landslide debris composed primarily of soils is classified
as landslides in the main heading. Soil-like materials
should be classified and group names and symbols
provided in the headings. The materials are then
described using the descriptive criteria for drill hole logs.
Where materials are predominantly rock fragments such
as talus and block slides, the materials should be logged
similar to the method used in figure 11-22.
Equipment Necessary for
Preparing the Field Log
The following is a list of equipment for field testing and
describing materials.
Required equipment:
• Small supply of water (squirt bottle)—for
performing field tests
• Pocket knife or small spatula
• Materials for taking or preserving samples—sacks,
jars, labels, cloth, wax, heater, etc.
347
FIELD MANUAL
• Hammer—for hardness descriptors
• Tape measure and/or rule (engineer's scale and
metric scale)
• Petrie dish for washing specimens
• Small bottle of dilute hydrochloric acid [one part
HCl (10 N) to three parts distilled water. When
preparing the dilute HCl solution, slowly add
acid into the water following necessary safety
precautions. Handle with caution and store
safely. If solution comes in contact with skin,
rinse thoroughly with water.]
• Rags for cleaning hands
• Log forms
Optional apparatus:
• Small test tube and stopper or jar with lid
• Plastic bags for “calibration samples”
• Hand lens
• Color identification charts
• Paint brush and/or scrub brush and water for
cleaning samples
• Marking pens
• Protractor
• Drillers' reports for drill holes
• Comparison samples (in jars): fine gravel—3/4
inch
to No. 4 sieve; medium sand—No. 4 to No. 10
sieve; and coarse sand—No. 10 to No. 40 sieve
• Small No. 4 and 200 sieves

Example Descriptions and Format
The examples which follow illustrate the preferred
format, description, and organization, and some of the
more significant exceptions to typical standards.
Laboratory Classifications in Addition to
Visual Classifications
In some instances, laboratory classifications may be
determined in addition to the field visual classification.
This may be done to confirm the visual classification,
particularly when starting work in a new location or
because the classification may be critical.
The laboratory data used must be reported in a separate
paragraph at the end of the work description, as shown in
the examples in figure 11-23. If the laboratory clas-
sification is different from the visual classification, as in
the upper example, give the group symbol in the left-
hand column and the group name in the paragraph on the
laboratory data.
DO NOT CHANGE THE VISUAL CLASSIFICATION OR
DESCRIPTION. The visual classification is based on a
widely observed area in the excavation, whereas the labo-
ratory classification is based on a sample of the material.
If the visual classification was the best judgment of an
experienced classifier, both are correct in what they
represent.

Word Descriptions for Various Soil
Classifications
Figures 11-6 to 11-17 illustrate some typical word
descriptions based on the soil classifications.
Logs are generally typed and single spaced. The
examples in this manual are presented double spaced for
legibility.
Samples Taken
In addition to the brief description of the samples taken
under the “classification group symbol” column, a more
complete description of any samples taken from each
depth interval is included in the word descriptions. The
description should include the size of the sample, the
location represented by the sample, and how the sample
was obtained (e.g., quartering and splitting).
Examples of how to report the sample information for a
pit or trench are shown in figures 11-24 through 11-33.
Some examples use the abbreviated method of indicating
the group name with the group symbol. This abbreviated
method is described in appendix X5 in USBR 5000,
“Determining Unified Soil Classification (Laboratory
Method)” [1] and chapter 3.
Reporting Laboratory Data
Classifications Based on Laboratory Data
If the soil classification reported on the logs is based on

FIELD MANUAL
The laboratory data should be reported on the log form as
shown in the examples in figure 11-4.
The location of the sample and any laboratory tests
performed need to be clearly described.
The coefficients of uniformity and curvature (C , C) are
u c
to be calculated and reported for coarse-grained soils
containing 12 percent fines or less.
Gradation percentages and Atterberg limits are to be re-
ported to the nearest whole number.
The fact that the classification is a laboratory classi-
fication needs to be indicated in the “classification group
symbol” column.
The words “about” or “approximately” are not used in the
word description.
Soils with More Than 50 Percent Cobbles and
Boulders
If the soil contains more than 50 percent (by volume)
cobbles and/or boulders:
1. The first paragraph describes the total sample
and includes the information on the cobbles and
boulders. The information in the paragraph is the
same as described previously for cobbles and
boulders.
2. The words “COBBLES” or “COBBLES AND
BOULDERS” are listed first in the classification
group name:
362
LOGGING SOILS
COBBLES WITH POORLY GRADED GRAVEL
COBBLES AND BOULDERS WITH SILTY

3. A classification symbol is not given. Where a
report or form requires a classification symbol, use
the words “cobbles” or “cobbles and boulders”
instead.
An example of a word description for a soil with more
than 50 percent cobbles and boulders is shown in
figure 11-13.
Special Cases for USCS Classification
Some materials that require a classification and
description according to USCS should not have a heading
that is a classification group name. When these
materials will be used in, or have influence on, design and
construction, they should be described according to the
criteria for logs of tests pits and auger holes, and the
classification symbol and group name should be in
quotation marks. The heading should be as follows:
TOPSOIL
DRILL PAD
GRAVEL ROAD SURFACING
MINE TAILINGS
UNCOMPACTED FILL
FILL
For example:
Classification symbol Description

363
FIELD MANUAL
fines with low plasticity, slow
dilatancy, low dry strength,
and low toughness; about 10%
fine to medium sand; soft, wet,
dark brown, organic odor; roots
present throughout strata;
weak reaction with HCl.
Reporting In-Place Density Tests
In-place density tests are sometimes performed in test
pits in borrow areas so that in-place densities can be
compared with the expected compacted densities for the
embankment. The required volume of material needed
from the borrow area can also be calculated. The in-place
density is also used to evaluate the expansion or collapse
potential for certain soils.
The density should be reported in the paragraph on
in-place condition. Examples of the format are shown in
figure 11-10. The upper example is used when only the
density is determined. The lower example is used when
a laboratory compaction test is also performed to
calculate the percent compaction (or D value if rapid
method is used) (USBR 7240, [1]). For cohesionless soils,
similar information is reported for the maximum index
density, the minimum index density, and the percent
relative density.
If the in-place density test hole spans two (or more) depth
intervals of classification, the data and comments for the
test should be placed in the interval description corre-
sponding to the top of the test hole. At the end of the in-
formation reported, the comment (in all capital letters)
must be added: “NOTE: TEST EXTENDED INTO
UNDERLYING INTERVAL.” An in-place density test
should not span different materials or layers.
364
LOGGING SOILS
Because the laboratory compaction test is generally
performed on the material removed from the test hole,
note that the data are for a mixture of intervals by
adding, “NOTE: COMPACTION TEST PERFORMED
ON MATERIAL MIXED FROM TWO DIFFERENT
INTERVALS.”
The density units are lb/ft3 or kilonewtons per cubic meter
(kN/m3).
Samples Taken
In addition to the brief description of the samples taken
under the “Classification Group Symbol” column, a more
complete description of any samples taken from each
depth interval is included in the word description. The
description should include the size of the sample, the
location represented by the sample, and for each sample,
how the sample was obtained (e.g., quartering and
splitting).
An example of how to report the sample information for
an auger hole is shown in figure 11-17. An example of
how to report the sample information for a test pit or
trench is shown in the section on word descriptions of
undisturbed samples.
The approximate weight of samples should be stated.
Measured Percentages of Cobbles and Boulders
If the percentages of the plus 3-inch particles are mea-
sured, not estimated, the percentages are reported to
the nearest 1 percent. In the word description for the
plus 3-inch particles, do not use the term “about” before
the percentages.

FIELD MANUAL
The procedure for measuring the percent by volume of
cobbles and boulders is given in the test procedure,
USBR 7000, “Performing Disturbed Soil Sampling in Test
Pits”[1]. This method is rarely used; percentages are
usually estimated. It is not recommended that the
percentages be measured for auger holes, since the mass
of material recovered is generally insufficient to obtain a
reliable gradation of plus 3-inch particles.
Figures 11-23 through 11-33 show a variety of logs of test
pits using both the USCS and the geologic interpretation
of the parent material. Note that USCS indicates that
bedrock has been altered or weathered to a soil-like
material. For engineering considerations, use the USCS
but present the rock conditions as well.

HAZARDOUS WASTE SITE
INVESTIGATIONS
General
Hazardous waste site investigations are geologic by
nature. Site geology affects how the contaminants enter
and migrate through the environment, controls the
severity of the contamination problem, and determines if
and how the contamination is remediated. An accurate
characterization of site geology is critical for the
successful removal and/or remediation of hazardous
waste.
Investigations at hazardous waste sites use the same
basic tenets of geology commonly applied in other areas
of engineering geologic exploration. Even though these
engineering geologic investigation techniques are
universal, certain specialized criteria and regulations are
required at hazardous waste sites which differ from
traditional geologic work. This chapter assumes that
accepted geologic procedures and equipment are used at
hazardous waste sites and only discusses the variations
in the planning, implementation, and documentation of
geologic field work required at such sites. Documentation
at hazardous waste sites plays a very prominent role and
involves much more effort than other geologic
investigations.
This chapter provides a general overview of documents,
terminology, processes, requirements, and site specific
factors for an investigation. This information can be used
to better prepare or conduct a field program. Much
information provided here is extracted from numerous
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidance
documents. Hazardous waste investigations involve a
FIELD MANUAL
myriad of documents and processes, mostly referred to by
acronyms. See the appendix for an explanation of the
more common acronyms.
In hazardous waste investigations, understanding the
contaminant’s physical and chemical properties is very
important. These properties are useful for predicting
pathways that allow contaminant migration through
complex subsurface conditions. The understanding of
subsurface conditions permits a program designed to
better investigate and sample potentially contaminated
soil, rock, and water.
Common Terminology and Processes
The "typical" hazardous waste site remediation process
involves several investigation phases. Each phase
usually has a different emphasis and a different level of
detail.
In general, there are two sets of regulations involved in
hazardous waste site remediation: Resource Conserva-
tion Recovery Act (RCRA) and Comprehensive Environ-
mental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act
(CERCLA). RCRA regulations are largely confined to
operators and generators of existing facilities, whereas
CERCLA regulations are confined to the investigation of
abandoned sites (Superfund). Although most Bureau of
Reclamation (Reclamation) activities involve CERCLA
investigations, wastes generated during the investigation
may fall under RCRA regulations.
According to EPA guidelines (Guidance for Performing
Preliminary Assessments Under CERCLA, EPA/540/G-
91/013), EPA uses a structured program to determine
appropriate response for Superfund sites. The CERCLA/
368
HAZARDOUS WASTE
Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986
(SARA) process ideally evolves through the following
phases: (1) discovery, (2) preliminary assessment, (3) site
inspection, (4) hazard ranking, (5) remedial investigation,
(6) feasibility study, (7) record of decision, (8) remedial
design, (9) remedial action, and (10) operation and
maintenance. Removal actions may occur at any stage.
Documentation
Proper documentation at jobs involving hazardous waste
is more important than at more "traditional" geologic
investigation sites. The alleged low concentration values
for risks to human health and the associated costs for
contaminant testing are primary reasons for good
documentation. Soil contaminants are typically reported
in parts per million (ppm) (milligram per kilogram
[mg/Kg]) and water contaminants are typically reported
in parts per billion (ppb) (microgram per liter [µg/L]).
Since relatively low concentration levels may influence a
decision for an expensive cleanup, the prevention of cross
contamination and proper testing procedures is a
necessity. Also, proper documentation is necessary for
legally defensible data.
EPA has established documentation requirements for
investigations. This chapter discusses the various
documents needed by EPA under the Superfund program
with an emphasis on the Sampling and Analysis Plan
(SAP). Other documents such as the Health and Safety
Plan (HASP), Spill Prevention Plan, and Community
Relation Plan are often pertinent to the field operation.
The SAP will assist in preparing the required documents
necessary before actual site work begins. Specific
requirements for individual programs vary greatly, and
369
FIELD MANUAL
common sense and regulatory concurrence dictate the
level of detail needed. The EPA report Guidance for
Conducting Remedial Investigations and Feasibility
Studies Under CERCLA, Interim Final, October 1988
(EPA/540/G-89/004) provides additional details regarding
EPA-required documentation.
Work Plan (WP)
The WP includes a review of the existing data
(background and study rationale), documents the
decisions to be made during the evaluation process, and
presents anticipated future tasks. The WP also
designates responsibilities and sets the project schedule
and cost. The primary use of the WP is to provide an
agreed procedure to accomplish the work. The WP also
provides other interested agencies (such as local
government agencies) the opportunity to review proposed
work. The WP is placed in the Administrative Record.
The WP may include an analysis and summary of the site
background and physical setting, an analysis and
summary of previous studies and response actions, a
presentation of the conceptual site model (including the
nature and extent of contamination), a preliminary
assessment of human health and environmental impacts,
additional data needs to conduct a baseline risk
assessment, the preliminary identification of general
response actions and alternatives, and the data needs for
the evaluation of alternatives.
Sampling and Analysis Plan (SAP)
The SAP provides the "nuts and bolts" of the procedures
to be used at a site and must be site specific. The SAP
should consist of three parts:
370
HAZARDOUS WASTE
(1) A Field Sampling Plan (FSP) that provides
guidance for all field work by defining in detail the
sampling and data-gathering methods to be used on a
project.
(2) An Analysis Plan (AP) that describes analysis of
the collected data, such as the contaminant chemical
data, the groundwater quality, and the geologic
setting.
(3) A Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) that
describes the quality assurance and quality control
protocols necessary to achieve Data Qaulity Objectives
(DQOs). Data Quality Objectives are qualitative and
quantitative statements that clarify the study
objective, define the type of data to collect, determine
the appropriate collection conditions, and specify
tolerable decision error limits on the quality and
quantity of data needed to support a decision.
The level of detail contained within the SAP varies.
Depending on the WP, the testing, analysis, and quality
control may be delegated to a differing lead agency or
contractor. Whether the SAP contains individual FSP,
AP, and/or QAPP, the SAP indicates the field personnel
roles and responsibilities, the acquired data goals, the
analytical methods, and how these methods meet the
DQOs. Guidance for the selection and definition of field
methods, sampling procedures, and custody can be
obtained from the EPA report Compendium of Superfund
Field Operations Methods, December 1987
(EPA/540/P-87/001 or National Technical Information
Service [NTIS] publication PB88-181557). This report is
a compilation of demonstrated field techniques that have
been used during remedial response activities at
hazardous waste sites.
371
FIELD MANUAL
The FSP specifies the actual data collection activities to
be performed. The AP provides the details if changes in
sampling methods or number of samples need to be made.
If the AP is a separate document, the FSP should spell
out in detail exactly how and why samples will be
collected in the field.
Included with the SAP (sometimes as an appendix to the
FSP) are the standard operating procedures (SOPs) to be
used during the investigations. The SOPs describe, in
item-by-item detail, the exact steps to be followed for each
sampling procedure. Included in the SOPs are calibration
and maintenance requirements for equipment to be used.
Manufacturer's recommendations and usage manuals can
serve as part of the individual SOPs. Further details
regarding standardized tasks are given in the EPA
Quality Assurance Technical Information Bulletin
Creating SOP Documents.
The QAPP is a companion document typically written
when the FSP is final. The QAPP ensures that data and
the subsequent analyses are of sufficient quantity and
quality to accurately represent the conditions at the site.
The QAPP often describes policy, organization, and
functional activities not addressed within the work plan.
The following is a suggested SAP format.

Health and Safety Plan (HASP)
Each field activity will vary as to amount of planning,
special training, supervision, and protective equipment
needed. The HASP, prepared to support the field effort,
must conform to the Reclamation “Safety and Health
Standards.” The site-specific HASP should be prepared
concurrently with the SAP to identify potential problems
early in the planning stage, such as availability of trained
personnel and equipment. The HASP preparer should
review site historical information along with proposed
activities to identify potentially hazardous operations or
exposures and to require appropriate protective
measures. Appendix B of the Occupational Safety and
373
FIELD MANUAL
Health Guidance Manual for Hazardous Waste Site
Activities (National Institute for Occupational Safety and
Health/Occupational Safety and Health
Administration/U.S. Coast Guard/U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, 1985) provides an example of a generic
format for an HASP. Commercial computer programs
that allow preparers to "fill in the blanks" to produce
rudimentary HASPs are also available.
A HASP should include, as appropriate, the following
elements:
1.
Name of site health and safety officer and names
of key personnel and alternates responsible for site
safety and health.
2. Listing of the potential contaminants at the site
and associated risk(s).
3. A health and safety risk analysis for existing site
conditions and for each site task and operation.

13. Local emergency numbers, notification procedures,
and a clear map (and written instructions) showing
the route to the nearest medical facility capable of

Spill Prevention Plan (SPP)
All samples, equipment, cuttings, and other materials
that have been exposed to potential contaminants must
be decontaminated and/or tested and treated according to
Applicable or Relevant and Appropriate Requirement
(ARAR). Contingencies must be made for accidentally
releasing and spreading contaminants into the
environment during field activities at hazardous waste
sites. Contaminants may originate from substances
brought onto the site for specialized testing (e.g.,
standards for chemical testing), from accumulations of
"free" contaminants, or from contaminated natural water
which is released during sampling or investigations.
Sufficient equipment (e.g., drums, absorbents, etc.) must
be onsite to effectively control spills. In addition, key
personnel should be identified for the control of spills.
Paramount to such planning are spill prevention
measures. Spill prevention plans may be incorporated
into appropriate sections of a SAP or HASP, if desired.
Contaminant Characteristics and Migration
A primary difference between conventional engineering
geology investigations and hazardous waste inves-
tigations is that drilling methods may impact the
contaminant sampling results and increase migration
375
FIELD MANUAL
paths. Lubricants, fuels, and equipment may mask
specific chemical testing or react with the contaminant of
concern (COC). All samples, waste discharges, and
equipment used in the investigations require evaluation
in relation to the potential contaminant(s). The following
unique site factors are also important.
Contaminant Properties
Some contaminants are inherently mobile, for example,
volatile organic compounds (VOCs). When released,
VOCs can migrate rapidly through air, soil, and
groundwater. Other contaminants, such as heavy metal
solids, are less mobile. Heavy metals tend to accumulate
on the surface of the ground. Although heavy metals may
not readily migrate into and through the subsurface,
heavy metals may still migrate through the air as
airborne particles. Understanding the behavior of COCs
is very important because behavior will significantly
influence the ultimate design of the exploration program.
For example, investigations to find gasoline, a light
nonaqueous phase liquid (LNAPL), should concentrate on
the water table surface. Dense, nonaqueous phase liquid
(DNAPL) investigations should concentrate towards the
bottom of the aquifer(s) or water table. Note that some
contaminants react with investigation materials; e.g.,
TCE in high concentrations reacts with polyvinyl chloride
(PVC) pipe.
When possible, the typical contaminant investigation will
estimate the source type and location. The source type
may be barrels, storage tanks, pipelines, injection wells,
landfills, or holding ponds. In investigations that involve
groundwater contamination, the investigation must
address collecting samples of material that may be
moving or have moved off site.
376
HAZARDOUS WASTE
Identifying the contaminant and its behavior within the
hydrogeologic environment must be kept foremost in
mind while developing the program. Hydrochemical
parameters such as density, diffusivity, solubility, soil
sorption coefficient, volatilization (vapor pressure), and
viscosity may impact the specific contaminant movement.
Biological activities or meteoric waters may impact
various COCs in the subsurface. Some contaminants
degrade over time and under some environmental
conditions. In some instances, the degradation product
(TCE to vinyl chloride) is worse than the original product.
A general introductory geological hazardous waste inves-
tigation reference is the Standard Handbook for Solid
and Hazardous Waste Facility Assessments, by Sara,
1994. A general introductory reference for environ-
mental chemistry is Fundamentals of Environmental
Chemistry, by Manahan, 1993. A reference on DNAPL
materials is DNAPL - Site Evaluation by Cohen and
Mercer, 1993. A reference for groundwater chemical and
physical properties is Groundwater Chemicals - Desk
Reference, by Montgomery, 1996. Toxicological Profile
Series published by the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Resources describes physical, chemical, and
biological processes which effect contaminant fate and
transport.
Geologic Factors
The migration of contaminants is dependent on the
subsurface materials and water. The arrangement of the
geologic materials impacts the direction and flow rate of
the contaminants and groundwater. Geologic factors such
as stratigraphy, structure, and lithology control the
occurrence and movement of water.
Various geologic factors to consider include: depth of soil,
depth to bedrock, depth to the water table, seasonal
377
FIELD MANUAL
variations in water table, water quality characteristics of
site aquifers, mineralogic compositions of soil and rock,
gradation, consolidation, and fracturing. Contaminant
characteristics, such as property differences between solid
or liquid materials, differences in liquid viscosity, or
differences in liquid density relative to water, may
influence how the contaminants interact with geologic
factors and how the contamination plumes will behave.
Hydrologic Factors
Groundwater flow is a function of precipitation, runoff,
and infiltration (figure 12-1).
Groundwater flow occurs through two zones: the
unsaturated (vadose or aeration) zone and the saturated
zone. Each zone can be either soil or rock. Groundwater
movement is affected by the characteristics of the
material pore spaces (porosity) and the interconnectivity
of the pore spaces (permeability). Water movement
occurs under a hydraulic gradient.
Other terms often used in groundwater are transmissivity
and storativity. Both terms are bulk terms used to
describe the water over the entire hydrologic unit. Trans-
missivity is directly related to permeability. Storativity
is a dimensionless value often incorrectly equated with
specific yield. For a more detailed description, see the
Bureau of Reclamation Water Resource Technical Publi-
cation, Ground Water Manual, second edition, 1995 or
Groundwater, by Freeze and Cherry, 1979.
An unconfined aquifer, often referred to as a "water table"
aquifer, has no overlying confining layer. Water infiltrat-
ing into the ground percolates downward through air-
filled interstices of the vadose zone to the saturated zone.
The water table, or surface of the saturated groundwater
378

HAZARDOUS
WASTE

FIELD MANUAL
body, is in contact with the atmosphere through the open
pores of the material above and is in balance with
atmospheric pressure.
A confined, or artesian, aquifer has an overlying,
confining layer of lower permeability than the aquifer.
Water in an artesian aquifer is under pressure, and when
the confining layer is penetrated, the water will rise
above the bottom of the confining bed to an elevation
controlled by the aquifer pressure. If the confining layer
transmits some water into adjacent layers, the aquifer is
said to be a "leaky aquifer." A perched aquifer is created
by beds of clay or silt, unfractured rock, or other material
with relatively lower permeability impeding the
downward percolation of water. An unsaturated zone is
present between the bottom of the perching bed and the
regional aquifer. Such an aquifer may be permanent or
may be seasonal.
Aquifers are typically anisotropic; i.e., flow conditions
vary with direction. In granular materials, the particle
shapes, orientation, and the deposition process usually
result in vertical permeability being less than horizontal
permeability. The primary cause of anisotropy on a
microscopic scale is the orientation of platy minerals. In
some rock, the size, shape, orientation, and spacing of
discontinuities and other voids may result in anisotropy.
These factors should always be considered when modeling
contaminant migration from hazardous waste sites.
After the natural flow conditions at a site are char-
acterized, the presence of artificial conditions which may
modify the flow direction or velocity of groundwater is
determined. Such items as surface water impoundments
and drainages may influence overall groundwater flow
models. Also, if existing water wells are present in the
area, pumping may be drawing the contaminants toward
the wells. All possible influences affecting the
380
HAZARDOUS WASTE
groundwater flow must be identified to model
contaminant plume migration rates and paths.
Classification and Handling of Materials
Classification of soils for engineering properties is
described in chapter 3. “ Instructions for Logging Soils
and Surficial Deposits” (chapter 11) describes logging
procedures, but there are two significant differences for
hazardous waste investigations.
(1) Logging of the soil is often limited to visual
inspection of cuttings. The sampling protocol may
prohibit the handling or poking of samples. Often
the samples are sealed for chemical testing, and time
for classification is restricted to the period when the
sample is being packaged. Size of samples is kept to
a minimum to reduce the amount of investigation-
derived waste.
(2) All material recovered or generated during an
investigation (samples, cuttings, water, etc.) should
be considered hazardous waste unless proven other-
wise. Material removed should not be considered
“normal” waste unless tested and permitted.
The RCRA “statutory” definition for hazardous waste is
broad and qualitative and does not have clear bounds.
Hazardous waste is defined as material meeting the
regulatory definition contained in 40 CFR 261.3.
However, the definitions of solid and hazardous waste
contained in 40 CFR 261 are relevant only in identifying
the waste. Material may still be considered solid or
hazardous waste for purposes of other sections of RCRA.
Some waste defined under the present regulatory statutes
could become hazardous waste in the future.
381
FIELD MANUAL
From the RCRA document, the definition of hazardous
waste is any
. . .solid waste or combination of solid wastes
which because of its quantity, concentration, or
physical, chemical, or infectious characteristics
may: (A) cause, or significantly contribute to, an
increase in mortality or an increase in serious
irreversible, or incapacitating reversible, illness;
or (B) pose a substantial present or potential
hazard to humans or the environment when
improperly treated, stored, transported, or
disposed of, or otherwise managed.
The level of contamination acceptable within the subsur-
face is based on a complex formula that involves the risk
of exposure; toxicity, mobility, and volume of contami-
nants; and the cost of remediation. Soil and rock removed
from a site cannot be returned to a site after the
investigation has been completed.
Investigation waste water must be tested and handled
under a different set of rules. If the water is mixed with
cuttings, the material is considered a combination of solid
wastes. If the water is discharged on a site, the water
typically must meet drinking water standards. EPA cur-
rently requires that sole source aquifers have special
project review criteria for Federal actions possibly
affecting designated aquifers. Water withdrawn for
public drinking water supplies currently falls under the
Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) (Public Law 93-523)
regulations, as amended and reauthorized (1974). (See
40 CFR 141 G for applicable water supply systems. See
40 CFR 143 for applicable water supply systems.) Note
that the number of regulated constituents and their
respective maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) are
frequently updated.
382
HAZARDOUS WASTE
Identifying and classifying hazardous waste is described
in Hazardous Waste, by Wagner, 1990. Procedures for
site evaluation are contained in EPA Guidance for
Conducting Remedial Investigation and Feasibility
Studies Under CERCLA, 1988.
Field Sampling Protocol
One of the most difficult parts of any investigation is
collecting representative samples. A sampling strategy
must be efficiently and logically planned which delineates
site location, number of samples collected, types of
samples collected, testing methods to be used, and the
duration and frequency of sampling. The difficulties of
drilling in the “right” location and the problems
associated with collecting representative samples is
similar to traditional investigations. However, for
hazardous waste investigation, the COC must be con-
sidered in both time and space. Statistical considera-
tions should be part of the sampling program. The follow-
ing are references for sampling statistical considerations:

Sampling Strategies
Investigators must determine the correct number and
types of samples to be collected, the proper chemical
testing methods (analytical procedures), and the proper
sampling equipment before field activities begin. Sample
containers, preservatives, sample quantities, and proper
holding times are also dictated by the chosen methods.
Table 12-1 is a list of recommended sampling containers
and holding times for various classes of contaminants in
soils.
Several sampling strategies are available, each with
advantages and disadvantages. Random sampling uses
the theory of random chance probabilities to choose repre-
sentative sample locations. This is appropriate when
little information exists concerning the material, loca-
tions, etc. Random sampling is most effective when the
number of sampling locations is large enough to lend
statistical validity to the random selection.
Systematic random sampling involves the collection of
randomly selected samples at predetermined, regular
intervals (i.e., a grid). The method is a common sampling
scheme, but care must be exercised to avoid over-
sampling of one material or population type over others.
Stratified sampling is useful if data are available from
previous investigations and/or the investigator has
experience with similar situations. This scheme reduces
the number of samples needed to attain a specified
precision. Stratified sampling involves the division of the

sample population into groups based on sample char-
acteristics. The procedure involves handling each group
or division separately with a simple random sampling
scheme.
Judgement sampling introduces a certain amount of
judgment into the sampling approach and should be
avoided if a true random sample is desired. Judgment
sampling allows investigator bias to influence decisions,
which can lead to poor quality data or improper conclu-
sions. If the local geology is fairly well understood,
judgement sampling may provide the most efficient and
cost-effective sampling scheme; however, regulatory
concurrence, rationale, and proper documentation will be
necessary.
Hybrid sampling is a combination of the types previously
described. For example, an initial investigation of drums
might be based on preliminary information concerning
contents (judgement, stratified) and then random sam-
pling of the drums within specific population groups
(random). Hybrid schemes are usually the method of
choice for sampling a diverse population, reducing the
variance, and improving precision within each subgroup.
After the appropriate sampling scheme has been chosen,
the specific type of samples necessary for characterization
must be identified. The unique characteristics of the site
COCs will play an important role in determining which
media will be sampled. Some sampling devices are
described in this manual or the Earth Manual, parts 1
and 2, USBR, 1990 and 1999. A summary of sampling
devices is shown in table 12-2.

Samples can be either grab or composite samples. Grab
samples are collected at a discrete point, representing one
location and/or time interval. Composite samples are
collected from several sources which are then accumu-
lated to represent a broader area of interest. The
requirements for testing will often dictate which sampling
method is used. For example, composite samples of soil
cannot be used for volatile compounds because portions of
the contaminants may easily volatilize during collection.
Many soil samples are collected as grab samples. Soil
samples should be collected from areas where dumping,
spills, or leaks are apparent. Soil samples should be
collected from areas upstream and downstream from
suspected contaminant entry and in areas where
sediment deposition is significant. Samples can be
collected readily from the first 18 inches (450 mm)
(depending upon the soil type) by using relatively simple
tools, such as spades, scoops, and dredge scoops. If scoops
are used for collecting surface soil samples, purchase
enough scoops to use a new scoop for each sample rather
than decontaminating scoops between samples. Not only
is time saved, but cross contamination is kept to a
minimum. The COC must also be considered. If
sampling for heavy metals, metal scoops should not be
used, or if sampling for semivolatiles, plastic scoops
should be avoided. Samples from greater depths usually
require more elaborate methods or equipment, such as
test pits, hand augers, thin-wall tube samplers, hand or
392
HAZARDOUS WASTE
power corers, bucket augers, cutting or wash samples,
direct-push tools, etc. The nature of the geologic material
to be sampled will influence significantly the methods to
use, but every effort should be made to reduce the amount
of investigation-derived waste generated from the
sampling method. Direct-push sampling (such as the
Geoprobe®) is preferable in that drill cuttings and drilling
fluids are not generated.
A useful field pocket guide is available from EPA:
Description and Sampling of Contaminated Soils,
EPA/625/12-9/002, November 1991. This guide addresses
soil characterization, description, sampling, and sample
handling. Within this guide are general protocols for soil
sample handling and preparation. The following are
procedures from the guide:
Soil Sample Collection Procedures for Volatiles.—
1. Tube samples are preferred when collecting for
volatiles. Augers should be used only if soil condi-
tions make collection of undisturbed cores
impossible. Soil recovery probes and augers with
dedicated or reusable liners will minimize contact
of the sample with the atmosphere.
2. Place the first adequate grab sample, maintaining
and handling the sample in as undisturbed a state
as possible, in 40-milliliter (mL) septum vials or in
a 1-liter (L) glass wide mouth bottle with a
Teflon®-lined cap. Do not mix or sieve soil
samples.
3. Ensure the 40-mL containers are filled to the top to
minimize volatile loss. Secure the cap tightly, but
do not overtighten.
393
FIELD MANUAL
4. Examine the hole from which the sample was
taken with an organic vapor instrument after each
sample increment. Record instrument readings.
5. Label and tag sample containers, and record
appropriate data on soil sample data sheets (depth,
location, etc.).
6. Place glass sample containers in sealable plastic
bags, if required, and place containers in iced
shipping container. Samples should be cooled to
4 degrees Centigrade (EC) as soon as possible.
7. Complete chain of custody forms and ship as soon
as possible to minimize sample holding time.
Scheduled arrival time at the analytical laboratory
should give as much holding time as possible for
scheduling of sample analyses.
8. Follow required decontamination and disposal
procedures.
Soil Sample Collection and Mixing Procedures for
Semivolatiles and Metals.—
1. Collect samples.
2. If required, composite the grab samples or use
discrete grab samples.
3. If possible, screen the soils in the field through a
precleaned O-mesh (No. 10, 2-millimeter [mm])
stainless steel screen for semivolatiles, or Teflon®-
lined screen for metals.
4. Mix the sample in a stainless steel, aluminum (not
suitable when testing for aluminum), or glass
mixing container using appropriate tool (stainless
steel spoon, trowel, or pestle).
394
HAZARDOUS WASTE
5. After thorough mixing, place the sample in the
middle of a relatively inexpensive 1-meter (m)
square piece of suitable plastic, canvas, or rubber
sheeting.
6. Roll the sample backward and forward on the
sheet while alternately lifting and releasing
opposite sides or corners of the sheet.
7. After thorough mixing, spread the soil out evenly
on the sheet with a stainless steel spoon, trowel,
spatula, or large knife.
8. Take sample container and check that a Teflon®
liner is present in the cap, if required.
9. Divide the sample into quarters, and take samples
from each quarter in a consecutive manner until
appropriate sampling volume is collected for each
required container. Separate sample containers
would be required for semivolatiles, metals,
duplicate samples, triplicate samples (split), and
spiked samples.
10. Secure the cap tightly. The chemical preservation
of solids is generally not recommended.
11. Label and tag sample containers, and record
appropriate data on soil sample data sheets (depth,
location, etc.).
12. Place glass sample containers in sealable plastic
bags, if required, and place containers in iced
shipping container. Samples should be cooled to
4 EC as soon as possible.
13. Complete chain of custody forms and ship as soon
as possible to minimize sample holding time.
Scheduled arrival time at the analytical laboratory
395

should give as much holding time as possible for
scheduling of sample analyses.
14. Follow required decontamination and disposal
procedures.
Water Quality Sample Collection Methods
Surface Water Collection.—Surface water on or
adjacent to a suspected hazardous waste site can yield
significant information with minimal sampling effort.
Surface water can reveal the presence of contamination
from several pathway mechanisms. If only a knowledge
of the presence or absence of contamination in the water
is needed, the collection of grab samples will usually
suffice. If the water source is a stream, samples also
should be collected upstream and downstream from the
area of concern. Additional monitoring of surface water
is required of seeps, spills, surface leachates, etc. If the
site has National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES) outfalls, the discharges should be
sampled.
Water quality samples are often the most important
material collected at a site. Determining the appropriate
number of samples and appropriate test method is critical
to a successful program. A good guidance document to
develop a water quality sampling program and provide
the reasoning for collecting appropriate water samples is
EPA’s Handbook, Ground Water, volumes I and II,
EPA/625/6-90/016. There are several factors to consider
in the selection of appropriate sampling devices. Time
and money are obvious factors; however, the data use,
formation permeability, water depth, and contamination
type are considerations. Water monitoring goals and
objectives should be addressed, such as:
396
HAZARDOUS WASTE
• Is the investigation to determine source(s)?
• Are the investigations included for a time critical
removal action?
• Have the potential contaminants been identified?
• Will there be a follow up risk assessment and/or
remediation?
• Are there potential responsible parties (PRPs)
involved?
Water samples can be routinely analyzed for current EPA
listed priority pollutants. Alkalinity, acidity, total
organic halogens, and chemical oxygen demand are often
indicators of contamination. Routine tests can be used as
screening techniques before implementing more costly
priority pollutant analyses. Bioassessment samples, if
needed, are described in Rapid Bioassessment Protocols
for Use in Streams and Rivers, EPA/444/4-89-001. If
technical impracticability (Guidance for Evaluating the
Technical Impracticability, EPA Directive 9234.2-25, or
natural attenuation are potential remediation options,
additional water quality parameters may need testing
consideration.
Groundwater Collection.—Groundwater
contamination is usually difficult and costly to assess,
control, and remove. Monitoring wells sample a small
part of an aquifer, depending on screen size, length,
placement depth, pumping rates, and other factors. The
use of wells and piezometers can introduce additional
problems due to material contamination, inadequate
construction, and uncertainties of the water zone
sampled. Guarding against cross contamination of
multiple aquifers is important. Proper well construction
requires significant skill. General guidelines for design
and construction of monitoring wells can be found in
American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM)
397
FIELD MANUAL
D5092-90, and guidelines for sampling can be found in
RCRA Groundwater Monitoring Draft Technical
Guidance, EPA/530-R-93-001. For general details on
groundwater quality monitoring well construction, see
figure 12-2. The location of the screen and designing and
development of the screen and sand pack is extremely
important in hazardous waste wells. Meeting the
turbidity requirement of less than five nephelometric
turbidity units (NTUs) is difficult to achieve in the best
circumstances. Drilling exploration and monitoring wells
in sequence from least to most contaminated areas is
good practice because this minimizes the possibility of
introducing contaminants into cleaner aquifers or areas.
Although the Compendium of ERT Groundwater
Sampling Procedures, EPA/540/P-91/007, provides
standard operating procedures for emergency response
teams, the recommended water quality sampling
procedures for groundwater should be in accordance with
EPA’s Low-Flow (Minimal Drawdown) Ground-Water
Sampling Procedures, EPA/540/S-95/504. The Minimal
Drawdown (MD) method requires using a submersible
pump placed within a riser and not operated until the
well has stabilized. The use of bailers and hand pumps,
including automated hand pump systems for water
quality sampling, is discouraged under the MD method.
Limiting water column disturbance is a primary reason
for installing a dedicated submersible pump. Lowering a
temporary sampling device into the water column creates
a mini-slug test. The surge of water may induce sedi-
ments into the monitoring well. As a result, the water
may not meet the five NTU limit that is part of the
requirement for water quality monitoring wells.
Sediments can significantly impact testing. If sediment
398
HAZARDOUS WASTE
Figure 12-2.—Typical monitoring well
construction for water quality sampling.
399
FIELD MANUAL
content is great, additional tests, such as comparing total
versus dissolved solids, should be considered.
Some sampling devices may induce volatilization.
Peristaltic pumps, bailers, or hand pumps in low-flow
conditions can impact the test results for semi-volatile
and volatile compounds. Peristaltic pumps may induce
volatilization if the samples are lifted from depths greater
than about 25 feet.
The MD method is the preferred sampling collection
method because the method uses a low pumping rate (as
low as 0.1 liter per minute) and attempts to limit
drawdown to less than 0.3 foot. If the extraction rate
exceeds the ability of the formation to yield water for low
permeability wells, turbulent conditions can be induced
within the borehole. Water may trickle and fall down the
casing. This may potentially increase air exposure and
can entrain air in the water.
Although preferred water quality sampling uses the
MD method, other methods may be acceptable to EPA or
other regulatory agencies. Devices such as bailers or
peristaltic and hand pumps are routinely used at some
sites. However, if these devices are used and surge the
well, water sampling protocols often require that the well
be purged of at least three well volumes of water prior to
collecting a sample.
Whatever sample device is selected, stabilization of
typical water quality parameters, such as pH, redox
potential, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and turbidity,
are usually required. Which water quality parameters
are specified may be dependent on the site conditions and
regulatory requirements. The water extraction devices
and procedures should be specified in the FSP and
400
HAZARDOUS WASTE
correlated to match the site conditions, contaminants,
and the regulatory agency requirements.
Vadose Zone.—In addition to sampling aquifers at
hazardous waste sites, significant information can be
obtained by vadose zone sampling. Leachates from COCs
migrate through the vadose zone toward the water table.
Samples collected from this zone can indicate the types of
contaminants present and can aid in assessing the
potential threat to the aquifer below. The various types
of vadose zone monitors can be used to collect water
samples or interstitial pore space vapors for chemical
analyses and to determine directional flow of COCs. The
main advantage is that such sampling is relatively
inexpensive, simple to do, and can begin supplying
information before aquifer monitoring is started. The
types of vadose zone monitors, their applications, and
their use in satisfying the requirements of RCRA are
discussed in Vadose Zone Monitoring at Hazardous Waste
Sites, EMSL-LV KT-82-018R, April 1983.
Geophysical Methods
Geophysical methods can be used effectively at hazardous
waste sites to assist in defining the subsurface character
of the site, to assist in the proper placement of monitoring
wells, to identify buried containers and debris, and to
decrease the safety risks associated with drilling into
unknown buried materials. A good overview of the
subject of geophysical methods for surveying hazardous
waste sites is: Geophysical Techniques for Sensing Buried
Wastes and Waste Migration, prepared for EPA by
Technos, Inc., available from the National Water Well
Association.
401
FIELD MANUAL
Miscellaneous Methods
Ambient concentrations of volatile and semivolatile
organics, trace metals, and particulate matter in the air
can provide important data on the atmospheric migration
path and the populations at risk and can be used for
source evaluations and personnel monitoring. Portable
monitoring devices such as organic vapor analyzers, stain
detector tubes, or other monitors can detect the presence
of various atmospheric hazards. Other monitors
commonly used at hazardous waste sites are explosi-
meters, oxygen indicators, and personal sampling pumps.
Other specialized sampling techniques may be necessary
at hazardous waste sites to sample media normally not
found in the geologic environment. Wipe samples may be
used to document the presence of toxic materials and to
determine that site or equipment decontamination has
been adequate. Wipe sampling consists of rubbing a
moistened filter paper, such as Whatman 541 filter paper,
over a measured area of 15 in2 (100 cm2) to 10 ft2 (1 m2).
The paper is then sent to a laboratory for analysis.
Sample Analysis
Onsite laboratories and field analytical equipment, such
as portable gas chromatographs (GCs) and immunoassay
kits, can be very beneficial for rapid analyses. Rapid-
analysis equipment, such as GCs, immunoassay, and
colorometric kits, are a cost-effective alternative for
providing qualitative and semi-quantitative chemical
data and for screening large numbers of samples prior to
submittals for laboratory testing. Another beneficial use
of field screening techniques is to provide general
contaminant level data for samples to be tested in the
laboratory. If a sample has a very high contaminant
402
HAZARDOUS WASTE
concentration, the sample may have to be diluted before
being analyzed to protect the laboratory instruments from
costly contaminant saturation problems.
There are many standardized testing procedures and
methods for hazardous waste evaluation. Table 12-3 lists
some common method series. Each series contains
numerous individual methods. There are over 25 series-
500 (determination of organic compounds in drinking
water) methods. Method 502.1 is for halogenated volatile
organics (purgeable halocarbons) by GC (48 compounds);
Method 502.2 is for nonhalogenated volatile organics by
GC (6 compounds); Method 503.1 is for aromatic and
unsaturated volatile organics (purgeable aromatics) by
GC (28 compounds); Method 507 is for nitrogen and
phosphorus containing pesticides by GC (66 substances).

An important consideration in planning any field
investigation program is scheduling the anticipated
activities. Sufficient time must be allowed for the
peculiarities of hazardous waste work. Several factors
must be considered: (1) time for establishing work zones
and erecting physical barriers, (2) time for establishing
equipment, personnel, and vehicle decontamination
stations, (3) time needed to decontaminate equipment
and personnel, ( 4) loss of worker efficiency due to safety
monitoring, safety meetings, and the use of protective
clothing, (5) documentation requirements and sample-
handling procedures, and (6) inventory and procurement
of specialized sample containers, preservative pre-
paration, and reference standards, and equipment
calibrations.
Safety at Hazardous Waste Sites
A major factor during hazardous waste site investigations
is the safety of both the general public and the site
investigators. The following references may be of
assistance:

Sample Quality Assurance and Quality Control
Sample QA procedures confirm the quality of the data by
documenting that integrity is present throughout the
sample history. Several sample types are used. Field
blanks are samples of a "pure" substance, either water,
solid, or air, which are collected in the field using the
same procedures as are used for actual environmental
samples. The purpose of the field blank is to ensure that
outside influences are not contaminating the true
samples (i.e., vehicular exhaust) during sampling. If
"hits" are discovered in the field blank, the question
arises whether contamination not associated with the site
is affecting the true samples.
Trip blanks are samples of a "pure" substance (analyte-
free deionized water which accompanies samples with
volatile contaminants) prepared in a laboratory or other
406
HAZARDOUS WASTE
controlled area and placed in a shipping container with
environmental samples. The purpose of the trip blank is
to ensure that samples were not cross contaminated
during shipment and storage. "Hits" in a trip blank
indicate that COCs were present in a container to a
degree sufficient to infiltrate into the trip blank sample
jar and, hence, possibly into true samples.
Equipment blanks are used when sampling equipment is
cleaned and re-used for subsequent sample collection.
The blanks verify the effectiveness of field cleaning
procedures. The final rinse for the sampling equipment
is often made with analyte-free deionized water. The
rinse water is run on or through the sampling equipment,
collected in appropriate containers and preserved. These
samples are usually collected on a schedule, such as once
every 10 episodes.
Duplicates are samples collected at the same time, in the
same way, and contained, preserved, and transported in
the same manner as a corresponding duplicate.
Duplicates are used to determine the precision of the
laboratory method and integrity of the sample from
collection through testing. Duplicates are typically
collected once every 10 samples.
Matrix spikes provide the best overall assessment of
accuracy for the entire measurement system. For water
investigation episodes, a laboratory usually prepares the
spike samples, sends them to the site, and the spike
sample(s) are included in the sample handling and
shipping process. The samples are analyzed blind by the
off-site laboratory. Matrix spikes can also be made from
certified mixtures of a contaminant and clean soil in the
field.
407
FIELD MANUAL
All types of blanks and duplicates must be prepared in
the same sample containers as actual samples including
labeling and identification schemes so that the laboratory
analyzes the sample without knowing that the samples
are quality control (QC) samples (blind testing).
In addition to field QC samples, the analytical laboratory
also uses QC samples. Method blanks are organic-free or
deionized water carried through the analytical scheme
like a sample. Method blanks measure contamination
associated with laboratory activities. Calibration blanks
are prepared with standards to create a calibration curve.
Internal standards are measured amounts of certain
compounds added after preparation or extraction of a
sample. Surrogates are measured amounts of certain
compounds added before preparation or extraction of a
sample to determine systematic extraction problems.
Duplicates and duplicate spikes are aliquots of samples
subjected to the same preparation and analytical scheme
as the original sample. Laboratory control standards
(LCSs) are aliquots of organic-free or deionized water to
which known amounts of analyte have been added. LCSs
are subjected to the sample preparation or extraction
procedure and analyzed as samples.
Field, laboratory, data validation, and report presentation
documents must be meticulously maintained during
hazardous waste site investigations. All field activities
should be recorded in bound, consecutively numbered log
books. Each entry should be made with indelible ink, and
all strike outs should be made by a single line which
allows the original error to be legible and initialed and
dated by the person making the correction. Entries
should include date, weather conditions, personnel
involved with the activity, the type of activity being
performed, unusual circumstances or variations made to
the SOPs, and data appropriate to the activity being
408
HAZARDOUS WASTE
performed. This is a diary of all activities on a site. The
investigator responsible for the activity is responsible for
maintaining the field log book. An important purpose of
the field log book is to document any changes made to
SOPs. If such changes may affect data quality,
concurrence with managers or regulatory personnel is
required in writing. All records must be under control at
all times. Unique project numbers should be assigned to
all log books, documents, and reports. All records must
be maintained and custody documented so that
unauthorized changes or tampering are eliminated. Log
book entries should be photocopied on a regular schedule
to ensure that field data are not lost if the original book
is lost or destroyed.
Activities during an investigation must be reviewed to
ensure that all procedures are followed. System audits
should consist of inspections of training status, records,
QC data, calibrations, and conformance to SOPs. System
audits are performed periodically on field, laboratory, and
office operations. Each major investigation type should
be subject to at least one system audit as early as
practicable. Performance audits include evaluation and
analysis of check samples, usually from laboratory
activities. Readiness reviews occur immediately prior to
beginning each type of field activity to assess the
readiness of the team to begin work. A checklist of
prerequisite issues, such as necessary equipment,
controlled documents, training, assignments, spare parts,
field arrangements, etc., are discussed and documented.
If any weaknesses or deficiencies are identified, the
investigator must resolve them before field activities
proceed.
409
FIELD MANUAL
Sample Management
There must be control and documentation of all samples
after the environmental samples are collected in the field.
The proper quantity of a sample must be collected to have
sufficient volume for the subsequent analysis. The proper
sample container and preservative must be used so that
sample integrity is not compromised. Many types of
samples (e.g., volatiles) must be cooled, usually to 4 EC,
throughout their history after collection. The proper
analytical methods must be identified to obtain the
desired result. The laboratory must handle and track the
received samples in a timely and accurate manner to
ensure that the results are correct.
Sample Custody
Sample custody is a prime consideration in the proper
management of samples. Sample custody is designed to
create an accurate, written, and verified record that can
be used to trace the possession and handling of the
samples from collection through data analyses and
reporting. Adequate sample custody is achieved by
means of QA-approved field and analytical
documentation. A sample is considered in custody if the
sample is (1) in one's actual physical possession, (2) is in
one's view after being in one's physical possession, (3) is
in one's physical possession and then locked up or
otherwise sealed so that tampering will be evident, or
(4) is kept in a secure area restricted to authorized
personnel only. Personnel who collect samples are
personally responsible for the care and integrity of these
collected samples until the samples are properly
transferred or dispatched. To document that samples are
properly transferred or dispatched, sample identification
410
HAZARDOUS WASTE
and chain of custody procedures must be followed.
Sample custody in the field and in transit involves the
steps described below.
Sample Identification.—The sample must first be
properly and uniquely identified. Sample identification
entails establishing a scheme which ensures that each
sample is identified in such a way that one sample cannot
be mistaken for another. Examples of sample labels are
shown in figure 12-3. Labels must be filled out
immediately after the sample is collected to ensure that
containers are not later misidentified. Indelible ink must
be used on all labels, and the writing must be legible. For
samples which require preservation, the sample labels
must have a space on the label reserved for noting the
preservative added, or other treatments, such as filtering,
compositing, etc. Labels can be removed from a sample
jar during shipment, especially if the accompanying ice
melts and saturates the shipping labels. Double-label
samples such as sacked soil whenever possible or
completely wrap the label over the sample bottle with
wide, water-proof tape. Also record the collection of each
sample in the field log book and chain of custody records.
Chain of Custody.—Once all samples for a specific sam-
pling task have been collected, the sampler(s) will com-
plete the chain of custody record (figure 12-4). Specific
procedures for completing this form should be included in
the work plan documents specific to the project. This
record accompanies the samples to their destination. All
samples typically are transferred from the sample
transport container (e.g., cooler) and kept in the exclusion
zone until transferred to a noncontaminated sample
transport container in the contamination reduction zone.
The samples, with accompanying documentation, are
411

412
413
HAZARDOUS
WASTE

FIELD MANUAL
then prepared for either distribution to the onsite
laboratory or shipment to an analytical laboratory in the
support zone.
When transferring the possession of samples, the
individuals relinquishing and receiving the samples will
sign, date, and note the time on the chain of custody
record. This record documents sample custody transfer
from the sampler to the analyst. Note that some
commercial shippers (such as Federal Express) do not
sign chain of custody records but do prepare separate
shipping documents which indicate receipt of the
cooler(s). When samples are passed among field
personnel while still onsite, chain of custody records do
not need to be signed, as long as physical possession is
retained by identified, responsible personnel during
transit of the container(s).
Packaging
Samples must be packaged properly for shipment and
dispatched to the appropriate laboratory for analysis; a
separate record accompanies each shipment. Samples
within shipping containers will be sealed for shipment to
the laboratory by using custody seals (figure 12-5). Seals
are made of paper, with adhesive backing, so that they
will tear easily to indicate possible tampering. There are
two methods of using custody seals. One method is to
place several sample containers in individual plastic bags
(or boxes) within the shipping container and then place
the custody seal along the only opening of each bag. An
advantage of this scheme is that the seal is not exposed
to outside influences; but the disadvantages are that the
bags are very pliable, and shifting may cause the seal to
break, and the seal may become immersed in water if ice
melts around the bags. The second method is to place the
custody seal on the outside of the cooler, along a seam of

the lid. The advantage of this method is that the seal is
stuck to the solid body of the cooler. The main
disadvantage is that the seal is exposed to handling by
the shipping company and other personnel from the field
to the laboratory. The seal must not be broken acci-
dentally because a broken seal will place all the
samples represented by the seal in jeopardy of
disqualification due to tampering. An option may be to
place clear tape over the seal as added protection.
The samples within a container must be packed to avoid
rattling and breakage. Styrofoam "popcorn" or bubble
pack sheeting are acceptable packing materials. Organic
packing materials, including sawdust, should be avoided
due to the possibility of becoming wet from melting ice.
Each sample jar should be wrapped such that jar-to-jar
contact is avoided. Also, it is usually desirable to place
ice at the bottom of the container, and place the samples
above the ice, with a water-proof barrier between the ice
and samples. This way, if the ice melts, there is a
lessened probability of the samples becoming immersed.
If time is available, ice should be double-wrapped, using
several "ice packages" to lessen spillage potential.
Chemical ice packs and dry ice should be avoided, if
possible, to lessen the chance of chemical contamination.
The chain of custody record must accompany each
container and list only the samples contained within the
specified cooler. The original chain of custody record
should be sealed in a "zip-lock" plastic bag and taped to
the inside top of the cooler lid. When the laboratory
opens a cooler, the number and identification of each
sample contained within the cooler must exactly match
the corresponding chain of custody record. A copy of the
chain of custody record is to be retained by the
investigator or site manager, and a copy is also retained
by the laboratory. A three-carbon copy type chain of
custody record is best.

HAZARDOUS WASTE
The water drain at the lower edge of the cooler must be
sealed so there is no possibility of the drain opening. If
any leakage occurs from a cooler containing environ-
mental samples, the shipping company will cease ship-
ment and delay the arrival of the samples, possibly
exceeding the holding times of the contained samples. A
shipping company may have unique requirements; but as
a general rule, the weight of a cooler should not exceed
50 to 70 pounds. If sent by mail, the package must be
receipt requested. If sent by common carrier, a govern-
ment bill of lading can be used. Proper shipment tracking
methods must be in place. Copies of all receipts, etc.,
must be retained as part of the permanent
documentation.
Upon arrival at the laboratory, the containers will be
opened, the custody seals inspected and documented, and
any problems with chain of custody, temperature, or
sample integrity noted. The laboratory custodian will
then sign and date the chain of custody record and enter
the sample identification numbers into a bound,
paginated log book, possibly assigning and cross-
referencing a unique laboratory number to each sample
received. The laboratory then controls the samples
according to the SOPs specified in their work plan
documents.
Decontamination
Decontamination consists of removing contaminants
and/or changing their chemical nature to innocuous
substances. How extensive decontamination must be
depends on a number of factors, the most important being
the type of contaminants involved. The more harmful the
contaminant, the more extensive and thorough decon-
tamination must be. Less harmful contaminants may
417
FIELD MANUAL
require less decontamination. Only general guidance can
be given on methods and techniques for decontamination.
The exact procedure to use must be determined after
evaluating a number of factors specific to the site.
When planning site operations, methods should be
developed to prevent the contamination of people and
equipment. For example, using remote sampling tech-
niques, using disposable sampling equipment, watering
down dusty areas, and not walking through areas of
obvious contamination would reduce the probability of
becoming contaminated and require a less elaborate
decontamination procedure.
The initial decontamination plan is usually based on a
worst-case situation. During the investigations, specific
conditions are evaluated including: type of contaminant,
the amount of contamination, the levels of protection
required, and the type of protective clothing needed. The
initial decontamination system may be modified by
adapting it to actual site conditions.
