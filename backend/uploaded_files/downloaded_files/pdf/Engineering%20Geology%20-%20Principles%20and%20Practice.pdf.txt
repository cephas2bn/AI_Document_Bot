Cover Picture
Here we see the front end, or head, of a tunnel boring machine stripped down to its essentials and
awaiting these before assembly to its tail. Its design and construction illustrates the need for engi-
neering geology. To the left is the cutting head, carrying discs to match and overcome the strength of
the rock to be encountered – in this case strong rock is the anticipated material, hence the discs. They
are mounted on a strong cutting head designed to both rotate and carry the thrust required to load
the discs against the rock, so they may grind and crush the rock to bore the tunnel. That head is largely
unprotected for the hole it will bore will not collapse; it is predicted that the rock mass will be self
supporting. Thus no tunnel lining segments will need to be placed behind the head and so there will
be no structure against which the cutting head can react to generate its forward thrust. For this rea-
son the machine has been given lateral pads (one is facing the viewer) to extend and press against
the tunnel wall, so anchoring the head whilst its forward facing jacks press the cutter and its discs
against the tunnel face. The rock mass is predicted to be stiff, deforming little under these lateral loads;
it could not anchor the machine if it were not so. No lining also implies no ground water; this is pre-
dicted to be a dry tunnel. Space has been left in the lower third of the head; this will be occupied by a
conveyor that will carry the debris from the cutting head up through the machine where it will dis-
charge into a transporting system (another conveyor or train or trucks) to be carried out of the tun-
nel; a stable range of fragment sizes is predicted from the comminution at the tunnel face. At some
stage in the design of this machine an engineering geologist has had to advise on the geology of the
materials to be encountered, the structure, stiffness and stability of the mass in which they are con-
tained, the presence of ground water and the likelihood of it draining to the tunnel, the response of
the ground to loading by disc cutters, the response of the ground to unloading as the bore proceeds,
the disposal of the cuttings and the danger to personnel that rock dust from the tunnel face, and gas-
ses from the surrounding ground, may generate. Insurers and Health and Safety legislation may re-
quire these variables to be the subject of risk analyses. If the tunnel is to pass under urban areas then
noise and vibration of tunnelling must also be predicted for the loads and advance rates that are re-
quired. Radiation of acoustic waves, the sort when strong enough that will be heard and felt at ground
level, is usually anisotropic and requires ground structure to be understood. Hundreds of thousands
of tons of broken rock may come from the excavation, some may be suitable for concrete aggregate
and used elsewhere in the project, the bulk may be used for embankments leading to and from the
tunnel itself, or for reclaiming land elsewhere; all these decisions involve input from engineering ge-
ology. Finally, the road on which the machine is parked is a small cutting; that cutting will get larger
as the hillside into which the tunnel will bore is approached until a rock face is exposed into which
the tunnel may start boring. This is the tunnel portal and invariably it has to penetrate landslides
that cloak the surface of the slope through which it cuts without disturbing the slope or the develop-
ments that may be founded upon it. All this and more is engineering geology.
Preface
David Price had written the greater part of this book by the time he died; it has been
completed by his colleagues as a tribute to the many contributions he made to the
subject of engineering geology through his professional and academic life.
David graduated from the University of Wales in 1954 with the degree of Geology
with Mathematics and Physics, joined the Overseas Division of the Geological Survey
and was despatched to what was then British Guiana, to map economic mineral reserves
and construction materials. He returned to the UK in 1958 to join the construction
company George Wimpey. The post-war boom was beginning and David was engaged
as an engineering geologist. In those days industry appreciated the need for research,
as little was known for the tasks that had to be completed, and David joined a remarkable
group of scientists and engineers at Wimpey’s Central Laboratory at Hayes; the young
reader can best visualise this as an ”industrial university”. At that time formal education
and training in engineering geology did not exist and as David recalled ”… no one really
knew what they were doing; we followed the principles of our subject, used common sense,
learnt from what happened on site and talked to those who seemed to know more than
we on the subject in hand.” It was David’s generation that established ”Engineering
Geology”, as we now know it, in the UK and he played a full part in its foundation.
In 1975 David was appointed to the Chair of Engineering Geology at the Technical
University of Delft. There he witnessed both the academic growth of the subject and
the portents of its demise, for by the time he retired, in 1993, David could see that
university funding would threaten the teaching of his subject. It was time to write the
book that had long been his intention; a text that set out simply and clearly ”… what
engineering geology is about and how it’s done” and to do so uncluttered by theory and
equation, which were to be used only to illustrate the information required from the
field for design and analyses; a book for those new to the subject, based on his lifetime’s
experience as a practicing engineering geologist, and on his view of the priorities for
its practice.
David started writing the work in the summer of 1995 but died shortly before his
text was finished. He agreed it should be completed by his colleagues and it has been
our happy task to complete that left undone, to smooth that left rough, and to connect
that left unconnected. Where possible the text has remained as written. The chapters
were divided amongst those of his colleagues who could help and their names stand
next to the chapters with which they were involved. Ian Higginbottom, a contemporary
from his days at Wimpey and life-long friend whom David viewed in many ways as his
mentor. John Knill, also of that vintage, Reader and later Professor of Engineering
Geology at Imperial College London, close friend and academic ally who was influential

David wrote; “I wish to acknowledge the contributions to my career and the assistance
I have received over many years from my colleagues Ian Higginbottom, Colin Davenport,
Robert Hack, Michiel Maurenbrecher, Arno Mulder, Peter Verhoef, Willem Verwaal and
Niek Rengers. Royalties from the book should be lodged with the Geological Society of
London and used by the Engineering Group to fund field work in Engineering Geology
for students from Britain and the Netherlands.”
As editor I must record, with thanks, the invaluable support I received from Christine
Butenuth, whose suggestion it was that the book should be saved by David’s colleagues,
and who provided urgently needed assistance with the final preparation of the text. My
work was entirely dependent on that of the co-authors whom I thank for their patience
and tenacity with the task they were set. It was David’s wish that this should be a project
involving “Delft and Imperial” and that it became. Post graduates, Stephen Gazard and
Baudrey Kock, helped prepare the script for delivery on time, and Marion Schneider,
our editor at Springer, has been responsible for publishing the work. Finally, I must thank
Imperial College for providing the opportunity to complete this contribution to
engineering geology.

Chapter 1
The Basis of Engineering Geology
1.1
Development of Engineering Geology
While ancient man must have had some intuitive knowledge of geology, as evidenced
by the feats of mining and civil engineering performed in the distant past, the present
science of geology owes much of its origin to the civil engineers working in the eigh-
teenth century. These engineers, while constructing the major engineering works as-
sociated with the industrial revolution, had the opportunity to view and explore ex-
cavations in rocks and soils. Some, intrigued by what they saw, began to speculate on
the origin and nature of rocks, and the relationships between similar rocks found in
different places. Their ideas and theories, based on the practical application of their
subject, formed the groundwork for the development of geology as a science. Engi-
neers such as Lewis Evans (1700–1756) in America, William Smith (1769–1839) in England,
Pierre Cordier (1777–1862) in France and many others were the ‘fathers’ of Geology.
Their interest in geology often stemmed from a ‘need to know’. They were confronted
with real engineering problems which could only be solved with the help of both a knowl-
edge and understanding of the ground conditions with which they were confronted.
In the later nineteenth century both geology and engineering advanced, geology
becoming a more-or-less respectable natural philosophy forming part of the educa-
tion considered suitable for well brought up young ladies. Engineering, characterised
by the canal and railway construction carried out by the ‘navvy’, on the other hand,
remained as an eminently practical subject. The theoretical understanding of engineer-
ing was driven by practical engineering problems. The geological knowledge of the
engineer, confronted by increasingly difficult engineering challenges, did not progress
as rapidly as geology, advanced as a science under the leadership of geologists such as
James Dana (1813–1895) in America, Albert Heim (1849–1937) in Switzerland and Sir
Archibald Geikie (1835–1924) in Britain. Thus, by the end of the nineteenth century
the majority of civil engineers knew relatively little about geology, and very few ge-
ologists were concerned about, or interested in, its engineering applications.
This widening division between geology and engineering was partly bridged in the
nineteenth and early twentieth century by the development of soil mechanics by en-
gineers such as Charles Coulomb and Macquorn Rankine, who developed methods of
calculating the deformations of earth masses under the stresses imposed by engineer-
ing works. The great leap forward may be considered to have taken place with the
publication of “Erdbaumechanik” by Karl Terzaghi in 1925, which brought together
old knowledge, and added new theory and experience to establish soil mechanics in
its own right as a discipline within the field of civil engineering. Subsequent publica-
tions by Terzaghi and others have continued to recognise a clear understanding of the

fundamental importance of geological conditions in civil engineering design and con-
struction. However, this appreciation has not proved to be universal and many engi-
neers continued to rely on inadequate geological knowledge, or over-simplified ground
models.
Failures of engineering works in particular, such as that of the Austin Dam in Texas
in 1900 and the St. Francis Dam in California in 1928, showed that there was often a
lack of appreciation of the importance of geological conditions in engineering de-
sign.
Such failures emphasised the need for expert assessment of geological conditions
on civil engineering sites and there was, by the 1940s, a trend for civil engineers to
employ geologists in an advisory capacity. However, while certain gifted individuals,
such as Charles Berkey in the United States (Paige 1950) and Quido Zaruba in Czecho-
slovakia (Zaruba and Mencl 1976), performed this function very well it was not al-
ways a successful liaison. Few geologists had sufficient engineering knowledge to un-
derstand the requirements of the engineer and few engineers had more than the most
superficial knowledge of geology.
Despite these problems the recognition that liaison was required slowly brought to
the fore a new breed of earth scientist, the ‘engineering geologist’. Most of the early
engineering geologists were geologists who had gravitated into engineering employ-
ment, educating themselves by study and experience. Certain notable engineers, such
as Robert Leggett in Canada (Legget 1939), developed their geological knowledge to
achieve the complementary aim.
Eventually engineering geology became sufficiently developed for the subject to
form part of university curricula. Thus, in Imperial College, London, engineering ge-
ology was taught at postgraduate level to both geologists and engineers as early as 1957
under the guidance of John Knill. Courses progressively developed elsewhere in En-
gland, Europe, America and Canada during the subsequent decades. Now there are few
countries in the world where engineering geology, in some form or other, is not taught
as an academic discipline.
While educational opportunities developed, the number of practising engineering
geologists increased until in California in the United States they were sufficiently nu-
merous to band together to form a professional association. This expanded in 1963 to
become the Association of Engineering Geologists (AEG), covering all the United States
and now with an international membership. In 1967, the International Association of
Engineering Geology (IAEG) was formed. This provides, for engineering geology, the
international association equivalent to the International Society for Soil Mechanics
and Geotechnical Engineering for soils engineers and the International Society for
Rock Mechanics for rock mechanicians. Reputable journals for engineering geology
have also developed, such as “Engineering Geology”, published by Elsevier. Both the
AEG and the IAEG have their own publications. National groups also began to pub-
lish journals of high reputation, such as the “Quarterly Journal of Engineering Geol-
ogy and Hydrogeology” published by the Engineering Group of the Geological Soci-
ety of London
Hopefully, having read this short description of the origins of engineering geol-
ogy, the reader is convinced that the subject exists. The next question is “What’s it all
about?”
1.2 · Aims of Engineering Geology 3
1.2
Aims of Engineering Geology
Every discipline must have an aim and purpose. The Association of Engineering Ge-
ologists includes in its 2000 Annual Report and Directory the following statement:
“Engineering Geology is defined by the Association of Engineering Geologists as the discipline
of applying geologic data, techniques, and principles to the study both of a) naturally occurring
rock and soil materials, and surface and sub-surface fluids and b) the interaction of introduced
materials and processes with the geologic environment, so that geologic factors affecting the plan-
ning, design, construction, operation and maintenance of engineering structures (fixed works)
and the development, protection and remediation of ground-water resources are adequately
recognised, interpreted and presented for use in engineering and related practice.”
The IAEG has produced a statement on similar lines which sets out the redefini-
tion of its mission in 1998 as The International Association for Engineering Geology
and the Environment.
The exact phraseology, and interpretation, of such statements varies from country
to country depending upon national and local practice. Thus many “engineering ge-
ologists” are essentially geologists who deliver basic geological data to engineers, with-
out interpretation. At the other end of the scale some engineering geologists might
design foundations and slope stabilisation, thereby spending much of their time as
geotechnical engineers. Much clearly depends on the training and experience of the
geologist involved, and the attitudes of the organisation in which he or she is employed.
A particular problem lies in the field of hydrogeology (or geohydrology). In some
countries much of exploration for sources of potable water is carried out by engineer-
ing geologists. In other countries this is undertaken by specialised hydrogeologists who
are quite separate from their engineering geological brethren. Again the national cul-
ture of science and engineering influences the trend.
Engineering geology may exist under, or be a part of, other titles, such as “geologi-
cal engineering”, “geotechnical engineering”, “earth science engineering”, “environmen-
tal geology”, “engineering geomorphology” and so on. If there is a difference in the
content of the disciplines described under these names it probably lies in the training
and experience of the practitioner. Engineering geology is taught in some countries
as a postgraduate (Masters) degree course following on from a first degree or other
qualification. If the first degree is in geology then the product after the Masters de-
gree will be that of an engineering geologist; if the first degree is in engineering then
the product may be considered as a geotechnical engineer.
Whatever their origins and training, engineering geologists contribute to the task of
providing a level of understanding of ground conditions that ensures the engineering
works are constructed to estimates of time and cost. In addition, such works should
not fail as the result of any misunderstanding or lack of knowledge about the nature
of the ground conditions. Engineering failures may cost lives and cause injuries, will
certainly cost money, and will result in consequential delay. To prevent such failures
and incidents occurring, the influence of the geology of the site on the design and
construction of the engineering work must be determined, understood and clearly
explained. The problem is how to achieve this level of understanding or, in other words,
how to attain the aims of engineering geology.
4 CHAPTER 1 · The Basis of Engineering Geology
1.3
Attaining the Aims
Behind every discipline there must be a basic philosophy or a way in which that disci-
pline approaches its problems. The philosophy of engineering geology is based on three
simple premises. These are:
1. All engineering works are built in or on the ground.
2. The ground will always, in some manner, react to the construction of the engineering
work.
3. The reaction of the ground (its “engineering behaviour”) to the particular engineer-
ing work must be accommodated by that work.
The first premise would seem to be fairly obvious but it would appear that, not
uncommonly, the work of designing and executing a project is sub-divided between
various types of engineers, architects and planners so that no single person may have
a comprehensive overview of the complete project. Thus the vital concept that the struc-
ture is but an extension of the ground may be lost, or even never acquired, by a par-
ticular member of the team in the course of his contribution to the work. The premise
that the ground will always react to the construction of the engineering work also seems
self-evident. The problem is to assess the magnitude and nature of the reaction of the
ground to both the construction and the operation of the project. This ground reac-
tion, the engineering behaviour of the ground, could be small and insignificant, or
massive and perhaps disastrous, depending on the nature of site geology and the en-
gineering work. It must, however, be known in order to fulfil the third premise, namely
that the engineering work be designed so that it can be constructed and will operate
within the bounds of the site geological conditions without sustaining significant dam-
age as the result of the reaction of the ground.
To determine the engineering behaviour of the ground the engineering properties
(in the broadest sense) of the ground mass and the proposed design of the engineer-
ing work must be known. These two streams of data must be brought together and
processed in order to determine, by calculation, the engineering behaviour of the
ground. It is of vital importance that the acquisition and processing of data is done
systematically to ensure that no significant factors are omitted from the analysis. The
problem is devising a system to do this. Some years ago John Knill of Imperial College
and David Price of THDelft began writing a book on engineering geology together.
This died still-born after a few chapters, but one of the joint products was the concept
that the sequence of operations to be followed to arrive at the engineering behaviour
of the ground could be expressed by three verbal equations. These were:
material properties+mass fabric=mass properties
mass properties+environment=the engineering geological matrix1
1The original term used was “situation” (Knill 1978). Matrix implies a database in which the relationship
of the components is defined – a highly desirable but rarely achieved goal in engineering geology.
1.4 · Materials and Mass Fabric 5
the engineering geological matrix+changes produced by the engineering work
=the engineering behaviour of the ground
1.4
Materials and Mass Fabric
The terms used in these equations require some explanation. Materials may be rocks,
soils and the fluids or gases contained within them. Material properties are the proper-
ties which are of significance in engineering, such as density, shear strength, deformability
and so forth. Mass fabric describes the manner in which the materials are arranged
within the mass (in beds, dykes, veins, sills, etc.) and includes the discontinuities (joints,
faults, etc.) which ramify through the mass. It is not possible to calculate the reaction of
the ground mass to engineering construction unless it is known how all the various
materials are distributed within the volume of ground stressed by the construction.
In Fig. 1.1 the building at the top left sits on compressible clay of uniform thick-
ness overlying effectively incompressible rock; deformation of the clay and settlement
of the structure into the ground is uniform. Under the building in the centre the clay
is not of uniform thickness. Settlement in this case is differential, being larger over
the greatest thickness of clay. The building will tilt, and may crack, but may not suffer
great damage. However, where the clay thickens towards both ends of the building with
rock nearest to the ground surface under the centre, as in the top right drawing in
Fig. 1.1, differential settlement may produce disastrous results effectively breaking the
back of the building. This simple example shows the importance of understanding the
subsurface distribution of materials.

the structure
6 CHAPTER 1 · The Basis of Engineering Geology
The distribution and orientation of discontinuities, such as bedding planes, faults
and joints, is equally important. In the two cases in Fig. 1.2 the discontinuity A could

permit sliding of the foundation under the bridge because it daylights in (i.e. intersects)
the slope face. Discontinuity B, with similar characteristics to discontinuity A, would not
pose a hazard even though it has a similar orientation because it does not daylight.
1.5
Mass
It is necessary to decide what is meant by mass. The ground mass can be defined as
that volume of ground which will be influenced by, or will influence, the engineering
work. The ground influenced by the engineering work could be, for example, that vol-
ume of ground stressed by the extra load of a building, a bridge or a dam. In a tunnel
the mass could consist of the volume of ground affected by the withdrawal of support
caused by tunnel excavation and that volume of ground from which water has been
lost by drainage into the tunnel excavation. The ground mass influenced by the engi-
neering work is generally very much larger than the mass in direct contact with the
engineering work. Thus, in a mining area, the engineering construction could be dam-
aged by subsidence resulting from mining deep below the construction. The “mass”
would thus extend down to the level of the mined ore body. Dams built in valleys may
be endangered by landslides from valley sides – these may be of some antiquity and
of natural origin, but new movement may be triggered by the construction process. In
such circumstances the involved “mass” would extend into these landslides, which could
be situated well outside the construction site.
The mass may also be that of an engineering work constructed from naturally oc-
curring geological materials such as earth and rock fill dams, breakwaters, bunds and
dykes. In such cases the material properties are those of the construction material while
the mass fabric includes layers and discontinuities incorporated through engineering
design and construction.
The reader may wonder why so much attention is paid to mass while, in so many
text books, particularly those on soil mechanics, the emphasis is placed on material
properties while mass properties appear to be if not totally neglected to be under-
emphasised. Emphasis is herein given to mass because engineering works are built
on ground masses, and it is the reaction of the mass which must be calculated. In soil
mechanics many of the traditional methods of calculation assume that the properties
of samples of material (mostly measured in the laboratory) are those of uniform, iso-
tropic, horizontal layers which compose the mass. Under many engineering sites soils
do lie more-or-less horizontally and their properties may be relatively uniform over
distances commensurate with the size of most engineering works. Thus the assump-
tion can, in many cases, be correct. The problems come when the assumption is made
without examining the geology, and without confirming that this degree of uniformity
is, in fact, present.
The first verbal equation given in Sect. 1.3 above provides sufficient information
to make a calculation of the behaviour of the mass with regard to the proposed engi-
neering work. This may be reasonably correct but engineering behaviour is often in-
fluenced by externally imposed factors of a more general and fundamental nature
which may be grouped together under the general title of the “environment”. These
factors could have sufficient weight to render all such calculations on the basis of the
first formula invalid.
8 CHAPTER 1 · The Basis of Engineering Geology
1.6
Environmental Factors
The environment includes such features as climate, stress in the ground, and natural
hazards, and can include time. The principal climatic factors are rainfall (amount, time
of occurrence, intensity etc.), temperature and wind. Rainfall is of particular impor-
tance in that it relates to the moisture content of materials and mass; it is well-known
that moisture content is one of the factors which determine the properties of materi-
als and mass. Particular combinations of moisture content and temperature produce
such special environments as the permafrost condition and the dry hot (or cold)
deserts. Materials and masses of identical lithological and structural nature may be-
have quite differently under the action of an engineering process depending on the
climate in which they exist.
1.6.1
Climate
Every region of the Earth’s surface is subjected to a particular climate. This climate
might be considered to comprise the yearly average weather, including such factors as
rainfall, wind, temperature, hours of sunshine and so forth. In most parts of the Earth
none of these factors is constant throughout the year. Thus, in the case of rainfall this
may be defined as annual rainfall, seasonal rainfall (the amount in spring, summer,
autumn and winter), monthly rainfall or even rainfall intensity. The rain, when it does
fall, will not necessarily fall uniformly. In some countries a rainfall of say, 200 mm in a
month, might fall in small amounts over a number of hours every day; in other areas
all 200 mm could fall in one afternoon. In Papua New Guinea the author experienced
a rainfall intensity of about 250 mm in one day of which 50 mm fell in one hour. Simi-
larly, temperature can be considered as the average for the year, season or month, and
also as maximum and minimum temperatures for year, season, month or day. Some
regions, particularly those near the equator may have remarkably uniform tempera-
tures, with little difference between maximum and minimum throughout the entire
annual cycle. Other areas, such as in desert or mountain regions, might have varia-
tions of say, 30°C in the course of one day.
How these climatic variations come about is a long and complex story, outside the
scope of this text, but essentially the main factors influencing the nature of the cli-
mate of a particular location are its latitude (influencing the amount of warmth re-
ceived from the sun), its altitude (also influencing insolation as well as rainfall), and
its proximity to the sea.
The reader may ask why climate could be considered to be of significance with re-
gard to Engineering Geology and Civil Engineering. Several important engineering
geological factors are related to climatic conditions. In almost all engineering geological
problems the presence of water and the depth of the groundwater table play impor-
tant roles in determining the behaviour of the ground mass in response to the engi-
neering process. Many site investigations take place in a relatively short period of time,
often in the “dry” season of the year. Depending upon the amount of rainfall, and the
infiltration of that rainfall into the ground, it may be found that there are significant
variations in level of the water table. Knowledge of the climate of an area can give some
1.6 · Environmental Factors 9
indication as to whether it is necessary to undertake long-term observations of ground-
water table level or not.
The distribution of rainfall throughout the year will indicate when rainfall is likely
to prove a problem in the execution of a civil engineering contract. This is not only an
issue of workers not wishing to get wet but also a question of clays softening to the
point at which their liquid limit is achieved (i.e. they become viscous fluids rather than
soft solids), thus affecting trafficability. Alternatively, very heavy rainfall in areas where
infiltration is low, and which have recently been denuded of vegetation, can cause soil
erosion leading to extensive gullying. Dry periods with strong winds can cause much
dust movement with detrimental effects on workers, machinery and sensitive equip-
ment. Very low temperatures can freeze water lines and thicken lubricating oil. Very
high temperatures can thin motor oil to the point where it fails to lubricate machin-
ery adequately and all construction work must cease.
These brief examples demonstrate the need to recognise the significance of cli-
matic factors when dealing with site evaluation problems and the practicalities of
construction work. While the “normal” climatic variations can have influence on the
success of an engineering process, “abnormal” climatic events such as hurricanes,
typhoons, whirlwinds, etc. may be disastrous. They are not necessarily abnormal when
seen in the context of long-term climate characteristics, for they can occur almost
every year in certain large regions of the Earth. However, the exact areas that they will
effect will not be known in advance so that specific locations may suffer hurri-
canes, for example, only very infrequently. Because they are, relative to the general cli-
mate, of infrequent occurrence, of extreme intensity and may have severe conse-
quences, such climatic events may be treated under the heading of “natural disas-
ters”.
1.6.2
Stress
All materials exist under certain stress conditions. The magnitude and direction of
stress may strongly influence the reaction of the ground to the engineering process,
and particularly in the case of underground works. Stresses encountered in the ground
may result from the following causes:
Gravity. The weight of the material above any level below the ground surface will cause
material at that level to compress. Vertical compression of an unconfined specimen is
accompanied by lateral expansion which, in a confined situation, results in the devel-
opment of horizontal stress. The ratio of horizontal stress (σ) to vertical stress (σ) is
h v
the lateral stress ratio K where:
(1.1)
Tectonics. Tectonic stresses, which may be residual from past tectonic movements or
active from present tectonic activity. These stresses appear to be mostly horizontal but
are often strongly directional.
10 CHAPTER 1 · The Basis of Engineering Geology
Erosion. Topographically related stresses can result from the redistribution of stresses
by the erosion of valleys especially in steep mountainous areas. In Norway ‘rock bursts’
(explosive failures of overstressed rock) occur in tunnels driven beneath the steep slopes
on the sides of fjords.
The distribution of stress around a tunnel or within a slope is much affected by the
major discontinuities, such as faults, within the rock mass. The problem just quoted
from Norway is particularly difficult due to the fact that tunnels tend to run parallel
to fjord directions, so that bursting occurs along the entire length of the tunnel.
The stress which is imposed on a soil or rock mass, either naturally or through an
engineering structure, is influenced by the presence of water which itself imposes a
stress regime determined by the pressure of water. The imposed stress, from what-
ever source, gravity, engineering loads etc, less the water pressure acting as a water
pressure in either pores or joints, is called the “effective stress”.
1.6.3
Natural Hazards
Many parts of the world are afflicted by recurring natural hazards. The most well
known of these in engineering terms are earthquakes, but hurricanes, typhoons, sand-
storms, floods, volcanism, tidal waves and snow avalanches can also be included. No
engineering work can be undertaken in areas where these problems occur without
recognising the significance of such natural hazards. The five most prominent natu-
ral hazards are floods, windstorms, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes and mass move-
ments (landslides).
Floods
Of all the natural hazards it is possible that floods are the most destructive. Although
not as spectacular as volcanic eruptions or as dramatic as earthquakes, they are of
regular occurrence and located in river valleys where people live and work. Commonly
they occur in the alluvial plains which are also rich agricultural lands. Floods may not
only kill people and destroy property but also kill the animals and destroy the crops
which form the food supply and underpin the economy of an area. Thus floods may
not only have an immediate effect but also be a blow to short- and long-term subsis-
tence.
The majority of floods fall into two categories. These are the ‘rainstorm’ flood, as-
sociated perhaps with such events as hurricanes or typhoons, and the ‘coastal’ flood
caused by a rise in sea level brought about by storms. It follows then that the majority
of floods occur in areas underlain by Quaternary deposits, for it is the recent sedi-
ments which form the flood plains and river bottoms. However, the origin of the flood
may lie far outside the area which is flooded.
The river and stream beds which traverse flood plains have a limited water carry-
ing capacity and, if the amount of water arriving from the catchment area exceeds this
capacity, then floods will inevitably ensue. The excessive amount of water being dis-
charged into the river from the catchment area is the result of infiltration into the
ground being unable to absorb the intensity of rainfall in the catchment. The basic
1.6 · Environmental Factors 11
cause of low infiltration lies in the geology of the catchment area; if the rocks forming
the catchment basin are permeable, such as sandstones or limestones, then infiltra-
tion can be high. But if the rocks are impermeable, such as mudstones or crystalline
rocks, infiltration is low and can more easily be exceeded by the intensity of rainfall.
This means that in certain areas of the world heavy rainfall on distant mountains
can give rise to floods on arid lowlands. The annual flooding of the Nile delta has been
considered as a beneficial result of this phenomenon because of the introduction of a
new layer of fertile silt, but to the majority of areas this excess water is very seldom a
benefit. What this does imply is that no proper study of a flood problem can be un-
dertaken without knowledge of the geology and climate of the whole river basin area.
In low lying coastal areas, dykes and sea walls give protection against sea floods. In
such polder areas the dykes serve to protect land which has been reclaimed from the
sea by dyke construction and land drainage. Such sea defence works must stand against
the forces of waves, winds and tides, and the unfortunate combination of all three in
unusual conditions may breach defence works. One of the most dramatic of these
events was the flooding which occurred in the Netherlands in January 1953 when
1490 people were drowned; the damage was estimated at about U.S.$2.5 billion. Since
this event the Delta Works have been constructed to prevent this happening ever again.
However, in comparison with other major floods, such as those which have occurred
in China when the Huang Ho or Yangtze rivers have flooded, this incident can be con-
sidered as “minor”.
A solution to these problems lies in the construction of some sort of defence works.
In the case of river floods natural levees may be raised or dykes constructed, but by
far the most effective technique is to control river flow by the construction of dams
within the river basin. Such dams may also provide hydroelectric power (thereby sup-
porting regional infrastructure) or may store water for irrigation in dry seasons. It is
one of the ironies of nature that many areas which are damaged by floods in rainy
seasons may also suffer from drought for the remainder of the year.
In urban areas the problems may be more difficult for there is less freedom to con-
struct major works. In many cities studies are made to map flood plains at risk and,
by flood routing studies, determine the effects of river control. The hazard of floods
in urban areas may partly originate in land subsidence caused by natural long-term
settlement, groundwater extraction (as is the case in Bangkok) or as the result of natural
isostatic subsidence. In coastal zones in seismic areas flooding as a consequence of
the generation of tsunamis (tidal waves) must also be considered.
Storms
The most well known types of major storms are hurricanes and typhoons which oc-
cur in regions of tropical and sub-tropical climate. Hurricanes are found mostly in the
area around the Caribbean while typhoons occur in the China Sea. Modern meteorol-
ogy presents explanations for these phenomena and the frequency and possible paths
of these storms can be established. The path and onset of storms can be forecast, and
appropriate warnings issued.
Civil engineering structures must be designed to resist wind pressures from such
storms in which wind velocities may exceed 100 kmh–1. This will mean additional load-
ings upon foundations; if these are piled then some piles may be need to perform in
12 CHAPTER 1 · The Basis of Engineering Geology
tension. However, other effects of such storms may be somewhat more serious. In
coastal areas there is sometimes a rise in sea level of some metres above the normal
which may bring about extensive coastal flooding and erosion.
Such storms may also be associated with extremely heavy and intense rainfall. Apart
from the flooding from overcharged rivers that will result, an increase in moisture
content of sediments on and within slopes may bring about landsliding. High run-off
may cause gullying of cut soil slopes.
Volcanic Eruptions
There are over 500 volcanoes which are classified as ‘active’ and it is estimated that, in
the last 500 years, some 200000 people have lost their lives as a direct consequence of
volcanic eruptions. However, although this is a large number and while all precautions
must be taken to prevent such loss of life, volcanic eruptions would appear to be of
relatively minor importance in comparison with other natural disasters. Thus, for the
sake of comparison, a single storm and the associated floods which occurred in
Bangladesh are thought to have killed 500000 people.
It is not proposed in this book to delve deeply into the various types of volcanic
eruption for the hard fact is that there can be little done, other than by very limited
civil engineering works, to mitigate these hazards. It should be pointed out that the
only sure way to avoid the dangers of active volcanoes is to live somewhere else! Un-
fortunately, expanding populations creep closer to volcanic hazards (as is the case in
Italy around Mt. Vesuvius) and, should explosive eruptions take place, future death
tolls may be far greater than those which have occurred in the past.
Earthquakes
Many textbooks handle the problem of earthquakes and civil engineering exclusively
from the viewpoint of the consequences to a structure when subjected to earthquake
vibrations. In such an approach topics such as the point of origin of the earthquake,
the frequency of earthquake events etc. are either not considered, or are given limited
treatment. Similarly, some seismological texts, when considering the behaviour of the
ground under the earth tremors, do not appear to consider the reaction of the ground
at shallow depth. Proper handling of an earthquake problem requires the following
components of knowledge:
1. An estimate of the likely strength, frequency and location of future earthquakes. This
may be derived from a study of the geology of the region around the construction
site and a survey of past earthquake events.
2. A study of site geology in order to assess the likely ground response to a possible
future earthquake event. This would determine whether any possibility exists of
phenomena such as liquefaction, land spreading, flow slides, etc. which are associ-
ated with weak, saturated Quaternary deposits.
3. An assessment of the likely response of the proposed structure to the anticipated
tremors and any other ground response events associated with the earthquake.
4. An assessment of tsunami potential generated from earthquakes causing displace-
ment of the sea floor.
1.6 · Environmental Factors 13
Equal attention has to be given to each facet of knowledge to ensure that, at the
end of the exercise, a suitably protected construction has been designed.
If the study being undertaken is concerned with the construction of new centres
of industry or habitations attention must be given to the effects of earthquakes on the
necessary infrastructure (roads, water, electricity, etc.) as well as on the development
itself. This is required so that, in the event that a major earthquake takes place, suffi-
cient infrastructure facilities remain to allow relief measures to be implemented.
Mass Movements
Mass movements are essentially landslides, but may also be held to include avalanches;
they can occur in almost any material, rock or soil. With regard to mass movements
in Quaternary sediments it is probably true to say that the very largest mass move-
ments are commonly associated with earthquake-induced liquefaction. Otherwise most
attention is given to slides in river terrace deposits, in superficial soils covering rock
slopes, to slides in man-made excavations cut into Quaternary deposits for road, rail
and other works, and to slides developed in man-made embankments. Recently the
hazards associated with mass movements on the continental slope have been high-
lighted as these could send tsunami like waves radiating across the ocean surface to
affect vastly greater areas of coastal development than the area of the original slope
movement.
Manmade Hazards
It may also be considered that the activities of man are also part of the environment
(perhaps as “un-natural hazards”) within which a proposed engineering work will have
to exist. These activities would be those not directly concerned with the proposed
construction and could include such features as subsidence due to mining, oil, gas or
water extraction, generation of seismic activity by pumping into deep wells or im-
pounding reservoirs, and so forth. The effect of such activities must be taken into ac-
count when planning new works.
New works may also be affected by toxic land contamination resulting from past
industrial activity. Ground-water and surface water may be polluted by leachates from
contaminated land or poorly confined waste deposits. The storage and disposal of
radioactive waste is a subject of major importance, much debate, and individual con-
cern. No one wishes to live close to such a disposal site but it could be it might be bet-
ter to live on top of a storage facility contained within safe geological conditions rather
than some distance from one located in less suitable geological conditions.
The pressure of human activities on the environment of the Earth has reached a
level such that man must now be considered to be one of the significant agencies de-
termining the character of his own environment.
1.6.4
Dynamic Processes
It is also important to understand that the processes that modify landscape and geol-
ogy are dynamic. Such water-associated landscape features as beaches, bars, sand spits,
14 CHAPTER 1 · The Basis of Engineering Geology
river courses, etc. can be dynamically stable representing a balance between forces
operating at any given time. What may be a small change, caused by civil engineering
construction, may be reflected at a distant location. Thus the building of dams on the
Ebro river in Spain has reduced sediment deposition in the Ebro delta with signifi-
cant consequences on coastal form, which will eventually influence harbours and ag-
riculture. Other changes, such as the ‘greenhouse effect’, may be a cause of eventual
sea level change, with subsequent potentially disastrous effects. It is perhaps rather
arrogant to assume that mankind is the only source of such effects, far too little is
known about ‘normal’ variations in the Earth’s environment consequential on deeper
seated changes. The human lifespan is too short to view such changes, and stability is
often presumed, although knowledge of Quaternary geology shows that there were
major climatic and sea level changes in the Pleistocene. It might be appropriate to
consider that the present geological environment is but a transient phase in the con-
tinuing Pleistocene succession of ice ages.
1.6.5
Time
With regard to time it is well to remember that all materials, whether natural or man-
made, are subject to weathering and decay in the progress of time. Consequently the
possible change in geotechnical properties of material and mass with time must
be considered when assessing engineering behaviour of the ground. The first
thoughts of the engineer are generally to consider what may happen during and shortly
after the construction of an engineering work. However, consideration must also
be given to how the ground may react throughout the whole planned lifetime of that
construction. Most engineering geologists have seen cut rock slopes that are stable
for a few years after construction but become unstable once weathering has had the
chance to reduce the strength of the material from which it was made and the
discontinuities it contains. Time may thus be considered to be an environmental pa-
rameter.
The majority of engineering works are constructed with the intent that they should
be able to operate without substantial maintenance or repair for a certain time. This
engineering lifetime is usually not less than 50 years. The behaviour of construction
materials (concrete, steel, brick and the like) over such a period of time in a particu-
lar environment is generally quite well known and assuming that there are no major
construction faults the anticipated engineering lifetime is often an underestimate.
However, the ground on which the engineering work is built, or within which the en-
gineering work has been excavated, is also subject to decay by the process loosely de-
scribed as weathering. Thus, a cut slope designed for a material of a given strength
(this strength being measured before the slope is excavated) may well become unstable
as the exposed material in the excavated slope becomes weathered. This is a particu-
lar problem in the argillaceous rocks.
In soils, whether of Quaternary age or older, it is now generally recognised that in
the design of slopes in clay consideration has to be given to both ‘short-term’ and ‘long-
term’ stability. In the latter case allowance is made, by modifying the strength param-
eters used in analysis, for the long-term effects of weathering and water pressure on
the stability of the slope.

Analysis
All the factors leading up to the description of the engineering geological situation
defined in the three equations set out in Sect. 1.3 may be established through the pro-
cess of site investigation. Thereafter the engineering behaviour of the ground with
respect to the proposed engineering work is determined by calculation and judgement.
If the calculated ground behaviour is such that it cannot be accommodated by the
construction process and would damage the completed work, make construction or
maintenance uneconomic, or in any way impair the feasibility of the project, then the
project must be redesigned or moved to a more suitable location. Redesign on an ex-
isting location effectively takes place by modifying the size and shape of the ground
mass influenced by, or influencing, the construction. Thus if a building cannot be
founded on shallow foundations because of the poor quality of the underlying soil
(Fig. 1.1) the use of piled foundations could be considered as one method of redesign.
This, in effect, means that the ground mass being loaded extends to greater depth, is
confined and perhaps incorporates stronger strata than those present at shallow depth.
The three verbal equations describe an approach, in effect a process of thought,
which should be followed to give reasonable certainty that the eventual calculation of
the engineering behaviour of the ground will be accurate. The organisation of this book
follows the pattern of these equations, which provide the link between successive chap-
ters.
1.8
Essential Definitions
Both geology and engineering suffer from a confusion of terminology. Many learned
societies and professional institutions have set up committees and working parties to
resolve problems of terminology and the resulting reports may serve as guides through
the morass of minor terminological confusion. More fundamental terminological prob-
lems are sometimes so deeply rooted that change is more or less impossible.
Thus many geologists refer to sands, silts or clays as ‘soft rock’, presumably work-
ing on the principle that, in geological time, they will become ‘harder’, eventually be-
coming ‘hard rocks’. However, many tunnelling engineers would think of soft rock as
shale, weak sandstone, mudstone, etc, rocks which can generally be excavated fairly
easily. In civil engineering, naturally occurring geological materials are divided into
‘soil’ and ‘rock’. The ‘soil’ is not only that of the agronomist but includes also un-ce-
mented granular materials (such as boulders, cobbles, gravel, sand, silt) and cohesive
materials (the clays). Granular soils have loose, easily separable, grains; cohesive soils
are generally plastic and can be deformed and moulded without breaking.
A rock defined in engineering terms is an essentially rigid and often brittle mate-
rial, far greater in strength than a soil, which cannot be moulded or bent without break-
ing. It should be noted that such criteria may also be fulfilled by hard clays which are
desiccated, although such material would not be considered as rock but as soil in a
special condition.
The distinction between rock and soil would seem to be clear enough but prob-
lems arise in practice. One major difficulty is that many excavation contracts are ar-
16 CHAPTER 1 · The Basis of Engineering Geology
ranged so that there is one rate of payment for excavating ‘rock’ and another for exca-
vating ‘soil’. If all rock is fresh, and all soil of alluvial origin, for example, there need
be no problem. However, rock is often weathered to the degree that it has the geotech-
nical properties of a soil but is still geologically recognisable as a rock. To the aca-
demic geologist a weathered rock is still rock; to the geotechnical engineer it is a soil.
Weathered rock can be dug out as easily as soil but should payment be made for rock,
in the geological sense, or soil, in the geotechnical sense? Similarly, if super-size boul-
ders are found in glacial soils, are these rock because of their size or merely extra-
large particles in soil?
Clarification of the confusion is not helped by certain attitudes which have devel-
oped over the years. Thus some soils engineers consider that certain of the weaker rocks
(such as chalks and shale), which can be sampled and tested using soils boring and test-
ing equipment, are effectively soils. While there is a certain justice to this argument, it
could be dangerous in some aspects of geotechnology such as the slope stability of
such materials, where slope collapse could take place by sliding on discontinuities not
related to material strength which commonly determines soil slope stability.
A common, but perilous, assumption is that beneath the surface cover of soil all
materials found below rockhead, the uppermost boundary between rock and soil, will
be rock in the engineering sense. This is not so. In many geological formations, per-
haps hundreds of millions of years old, layers may be found that have the geotechnical
characteristics of soils. Thus in Europe un-cemented sands are found in the Triassic
and Permian, and clays occur beneath coals in the Carboniferous Coal Measures. On
the other hand ‘engineering rocks’ may be found in alluvial soils of quite recent ori-
gin. Thus cemented sandstones and limestones may be found within recently depos-
ited sediments, mostly in tropical areas, and a hard, cemented layer, a “duricrust”, may
be developed in near-surface dry environments.
The contractual and engineering problems that may originate in the subtleties of
distinction between rock and soil can mostly be solved by the application of common
sense. However, it is much better for the geotechnologist to develop the habit of think-
ing of both soils and rocks as simply ‘materials’ whose behaviour will be determined
by their geotechnical properties.

Training and Professional Development in Engineering Geology
The preceding pages have reviewed the facets of engineering and natural sciences that
enter into the content of the discipline of Engineering Geology. This review provides
a guide to the content of the training that is required to develop a fully rounded engi-
neering geologist. Some of the basic subjects taught in any training in engineering
geology are presented in Fig. 1.3.
Within the limited time available for any university training none of the subjects
listed in Fig. 1.3 can be taught to any great depth so, for example, a properly qualified
and able soil mechanics engineer must know more about soil mechanics than an en-
gineering geologist. The engineering geologist might then be unreasonably accused
by any professionals specialised and expert in one of the subjects listed in Fig. 1.3 as
being ‘a jack of all trades and master of none’. The recognition and definition of the
problems that may come from the interaction of engineering and geology in fact re-
1.9 · Training and Professional Development in Engineering Geology 17
Fig. 1.3. Subjects included in engineering geological training courses
quires such broad knowledge. It has been often found, in the author’s experience, that
a problem recognised and defined is a problem solved. This solution may not neces-
sarily be provided by the engineering geologist but by the expertise of some other
professional; it is not important who solves a problem but that the problem is resolved.
Most engineering geologists, once employed, find themselves drifting into one or
another field of specialisation depending upon the character of the company employ-
ing them. Thus an engineering geologist employed by a dredging company is unlikely
to gain much experience in the construction of nuclear power station foundations and
vice versa. Perhaps first employment is best gained on a major project such as the
construction of a hydroelectric scheme, or motorway to view as many facets of civil
engineering as possible and thereby gain a general feel for the processes and difficul-
ties of engineering.
The engineering geologist must be prepared to learn continually. It is very possible
that the young engineering geologist may find him or herself at a day’s notice on an
18 CHAPTER 1 · The Basis of Engineering Geology
aeroplane, off to investigate a possible route for a pipeline through the desert, armed
with literature on the geology of the country of destination, sand dune movement,
pipeline construction and ‘how to survive in a desert’. Such are the attractions of the
profession.
Experience counts, and this includes experience gained from others. Thus, in any
company employing more than one engineering geologist, while they may have sepa-
rate duties, they are best retained as a group to learn from each other’s experiences as
well as their own.

Geological Materials
2.1
Important Characteristics of Geological Materials
Engineers work with large volumes of soil and rock which will contain variable
amounts of fluid in their pores and fractures. It is helpful to distinguish the material
from which these volumes are made from the mass which they form. Sediments are
made from particles, big and small, and “rocks” are made from rock!
2.1.1
Sediments
The coarsest sediments are those produced by landsliding and glaciation which may
transport fragments of rock so large that an examination at close range may fail to
recognise that they have been displaced. More commonly, rock fragments found be-
low eroding cliffs may be many tonnes in weight. Such very large fragments may be
further eroded during river transportation to gravel and boulder size. These fragments
are recognisably rock but, as they disintegrate to yet smaller and sand-size grains, the
grains tend to be largely of single minerals. The type of mineral of which they are
composed will depend upon the source rock and the degree of abrasion suffered dur-
ing transportation. Thus the most common sand-forming mineral is quartz, but in
limestone areas the grains may be predominantly calcareous. If there are local sources
of less erosion-resistant minerals, such as mica, these may be found mixed with more
resistant minerals transported from distant sources. Grains of all sizes will be, to some
degree, rounded by abrasion during transportation and the degree of roundness
achieved is of geotechnical significance, for angular grains tend to interlock and give
greater shear strength than more rounded grains. The distribution of grain sizes in
sediment may vary (Fig. 2.1).
Uniformly graded sediments comprise more or less equally distributed represen-
tatives of many grain sizes. Well graded sediments are mostly of one grain size while
gap graded sediments lack a range of grain sizes. Well graded sediments tend to have
greater porosity and thus greater permeability than uniformly graded sediments be-
cause there are fewer finer particles to fill pore spaces between larger particles. At silt
size, the particles and the pore spaces between them are very small so that permeabil-
ity is very low and movement of water slow. For this reason, attempts to compact wa-
ter saturated silt may result in raised pore water pressures and the subsequent lique-
faction of the deposit.
All of the sediments so far described are granular and the grains do not adhere to
each other. The yet finer grained sediments, clays, are formed of particles less than
22 CHAPTER 2 · Geological Materials
Fig. 2.1. Types of grading in
granular sediments
0.002 mm in diameter and often much smaller, and are commonly very small plates
of clay minerals bonded together by electro-chemical forces. This bonding gives the
clay cohesion allowing the material to be moulded. Clay minerals result mainly from
the weathering of other rock forming minerals. Thus kaolinite results from the weath-
ering of feldspars in granitic rocks. Clay micas are a common constituent of clays and
range, with increasing degradation, from the primary mineral muscovite to the sec-
ondary minerals sericite and, at the end of the series, illite. Muscovite has a low con-
tent of combined and adsorbed water but this, together with interstitial water, increases
to the end of the series. The montmorillonite group of clay minerals, now known by
the earlier term ‘smectites’, are renowned for their capacity to expand on taking in water
and give rise to extreme swelling. Members of the chlorite group of clay minerals also
have a capacity for swelling.
Organic deposits of plant remains may be laid down in swampy environments to
form highly compressible peat deposits. Plant remains may also be mixed intimately
with clays to form organic clays and have a significant influence on the behaviour of
these materials.
2.1.2
Intact Rock Materials
‘Intact’ rock is commonly taken to mean a piece of rock about the size of a laboratory
test specimen (usually a cylinder of core no larger than about 100 mm long and 50 mm
diameter) without obvious cracks or breaks. Most rocks are formed of mineral grains
or other rock fragments bonded together in some way. The amount of pore space
present, the size of the pores and the nature and quantity of the cement has a major
effect on the mechanical properties of the intact rock material. In general terms, the
greater the porosity, the weaker the rock and, of course, the weaker and less abundant
the cementing mineral, the weaker the rock also.
No rock can be stronger than the minerals of which it is composed and the nature
of the rock forming minerals has a dominating influence on the behaviour of some
2.2 · Description of Materials 23
rocks. Thus rocks formed from soluble minerals such as calcite and gypsum, pose
problems from past solution and future solubility. Evaporites are effectively
monomineralic rocks whose formation is associated with the evaporation of mineral
charged water. They include such minerals as halite (rock salt), gypsum and anhydrite
and potash salts (such as a carnallite and polyhalite). Evaporites, particularly rock salt,
will flow under pressure and may be found in salt domes pushed, and still moving from
their original position, upward into overlying strata. The susceptibility of these rocks
to creep gives problems in mines and tunnels.
2.1.3
Fluids and Gasses
The main fluids of importance in engineering geology are water and oil. It is almost
impossible to over-emphasise the importance of water in determining the engineer-
ing behaviour of geological materials and masses. Water is almost incompressible and
when present in the pore spaces of a material, if only in small amounts, will modify
the behaviour of that material under stress. The behaviour of clays, in particular, is
very much dependent on moisture content. Water is seldom pure and contains dis-
solved minerals, such as sulphates, which may react with engineering materials. Sa-
linity and acidity limits its use in such processes as the manufacture of concrete. On
freezing, water expands and ground heave and ice wedging are important mechanisms
causing ground disruption and slope instability.
Oil as a fluid in the ground is not often of direct importance in civil engineering
unless there are projects proposed at great depth in which oil may be inadvertently
encountered. However, it is a common cause of contamination in industrial sites and
becomes a component of sediments that has to be considered when such sites are re-
developed.
Many different gasses can occur underground particularly in volcanic areas but,
apart from air, in the pores of ground above the water table the most important com-
monly encountered gas is methane. Methane is explosive and is associated with un-
derground works in carbonaceous rocks, but may be also be derived from peaty or-
ganic matter contained within unconsolidated clays and silts. It is non-toxic but may
be asphyxiating by reducing the oxygen content in the air. The author has had an un-
fortunate experience with hydrogen sulphide (the rotten egg gas) which is highly toxic
and comes from the decay of organic materials and the action of acid waters on py-
rites. It was released during a water well pumping test in the Middle East; at first the
smell warned of its presence but it then seemed to disperse. It was however the author’s
sense of smell that was deadened and who, with continued inhalation, turned slightly
blue and was carried off unconscious.
2.2
Description of Materials
The identification and description of soil and rock in samples or in the mass is com-
monly one of the tasks with which the young geotechnologist is entrusted in his or
her first employment. It thus may sometimes be thought to be something of little im-
portance, to which scant attention may be given by more experienced personnel. This
24 CHAPTER 2 · Geological Materials
is not so. In most projects the design of the project is based upon an evaluation of
ground conditions which is established from the description of samples and natural
or excavated outcrops, and thence the testing of chosen materials. Most testing is un-
dertaken on materials which represent the various bodies identified by visual in-
spection. Thus correct identification is of vital importance and is the firm basis on
which all geotechnical models are founded. Many significant engineering mishaps have
originated in poor description, and the inaccurate description of ground conditions
is a common cause for contract claims.
Identification and description are a basis for classification. Features or properties
of the material are identified or measured and then described using standard phrase-
ology. Features may be colour, mineralogy, structure, texture, presence of weathering
etc.; properties may be strength, deformability, permeability etc. Classification using
these features and properties assigns a name to the material, grades properties and so
forth. The aim of this procedure is to give a means of reliable communication between
geotechnologists so that no engineering errors occur as a consequence of misunder-
standing.
The name to the soil is given by its grain size. Many grain size classifications exist,
each with minor variations reflecting problems in the particular country of their ori-
gin. Terminology is not uniform throughout the world. A simple grain size classifica-
tion for soils, following BS EN ISO 14688-1, is given in Table 2.1. A full description may
include such physical properties as relative density (for sands) or strength (for clays)
and a description of geological structure. Other features such as colour may be added
to help distinguish one stratum of material from another. A description of sand might
thus be:
“Dense thinly bedded grey fine SAND,” while the description of clay might be: “Stiff
thinly laminated brown CLAY”
Table 2.1. Grain size classifica-
tion for engineering soils
2.2 · Description of Materials 25
Many soils are mixtures of two or more grain sizes to give descriptions such as ‘silty
SAND’, ‘sandy CLAY’ and ‘silty sandy GRAVEL’. Detailed guidance as to the percent-
age of subordinate grain sizes required to give a qualified remark (such as ‘slightly
sandy’, ‘sandy’ or ‘very sandy’) is given in BS EN ISO 14688-1. It is important to in-
clude accurate assessments of the proportions of subordinate grain sizes in a descrip-
tion because their presence may significantly modify the behaviour of the main body
of material.
Strength is one of the most important parameters for engineering purposes and
so scales of strength have been devised. One such scale is given in Table 2.2. It should
be stated whether the rock is fresh (un-weathered) and thus at its greatest strength or
has been weakened by weathering to, say, a decomposed condition. A typical descrip-
tion for a fragment of rock material might be “Decomposed thinly bedded red coarse
micaceous SANDSTONE, weak”.
Geotechnology deals mostly with the mechanics of earth materials and masses, and
the reader may wonder why it is necessary to give a geological name to a rock mate-
rial if its mechanical properties are known. Rock names are based on mineralogy, tex-
ture, grain size, genesis, geographical location and other parameters which may have
no direct bearing on mechanical properties. This is in contrast to soil names which,
since they depend on grain size, tell something about their properties such as poros-
ity and permeability. However, rocks must be named because of the association of the
rock type with other phenomena which may be of significance in engineering.
Table 2.2. Strength scale for clays and rocks
26 CHAPTER 2 · Geological Materials
For example, Limestone if associated with underground caverns, would suggest the
possible presence of solution cavities, high permeability, and water resources. Quartzite
is associated with high strength and abrasiveness. Basalt, if extrusive as lava flows, is
associated with scoriaceous and rubble deposits between flows, very irregular thickness,
interlayers of weathered material, buried soil horizons and poorly defined jointing,
except in the centre of thick flows. If intrusive as thin dykes or cylindrical plugs, joint-
ing may be well defined. Shale and schist have very closely spaced bedding or folia-
tion discontinuities, giving many opportunities for failure and anisotropic properties.
Exact identification is not the task of the engineer but, because the engineer on site
may be the first person to see new excavations, he or she should be able to identify
approximately any rock exposed, for this identification might lead to the early recog-
nition of a problem. This identification need not be as accurate as a geologist should
give, but should be not too far from the truth. Figure 2.2 gives an ‘Aid to the identifica-
tion of rocks for engineering purposes’ which may be used by engineers. Engineering
geologists are, however, required to give the correct name to a rock for this might lead
to associations with more complex problems than those mentioned.
The distinction between igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic rocks is often best
made by a simple visual examination of the outcrop.
2.3
Properties and their Measurement
The following factors will determine the properties of a dry material:
(cid:1) the types of minerals to be found in the grains and the physical properties of those
minerals,
(cid:1) the size and shape of the grains,
(cid:1) the density of the packing of the grains,
(cid:1) the nature and strength of the bonding between the grains,
(cid:1) the distribution of these grains within the material, whether random, layered, ori-
entated and so forth.
These factors are clearly of importance and there have been attempts to correlate
basic characteristics with material properties. As an illustration of one of the early
works that of Koerner (1970) on sands may be cited. Following undertaking many
triaxial tests he concluded that:
ϕd=ϕf+ϕδ (2.1)
where ϕd is the friction angle measured in drained triaxial shear, ϕf is the frictional
component and ϕδ is a dilational component. A value of ϕf was proposed based on
the mineral grain properties of the saturated sands tested such that:
ϕf=36°+∆ϕ+∆ϕ+∆ϕ+∆ϕ+∆ϕ (2.2)

where ∆ϕ=a particle shape correction; ∆ϕ=a particle size correction; ∆ϕ=a cor-

mineralogy. Most of the five factors considered to determine material properties are
incorporated in Koerner’s formula.
28 CHAPTER 2 · Geological Materials
Presently, material testing is undertaken in the laboratory or in the field and the
parameters measured are generally related to the following basic properties:
(cid:1) density
(cid:1) porosity and permeability ‡
(cid:1) strength ‡
(cid:1) deformability ‡
(cid:1) abrasivity ‡
(cid:1) environmental reactivity
The last property relates to the stability and durability of materials when they are
taken out of their ‘natural’ environment and placed in another. Thus, rock taken from
a quarry and used as concrete aggregate may, when placed in the new environment of
concrete, chemically react with the cement and change its mineralogical character.
Most geological materials are anisotropic as a result of the way in which they were
formed or deposited. Thus most sediments are bedded, metamorphic rocks may have
lineations or foliations and igneous rocks may be banded, so that the properties of
the materials vary with the internal structure and texture of the material. Results of
tests on these materials will vary depending on the direction of testing. In some cases
the internal anisotropy may be so slight as to be insignificant and for all practical
purposes the material may be considered to be homogeneous and isotropic; much of
the background theory of soil mechanics and rock mechanics is based on the assump-
tion that the materials dealt with are isotropic and homogeneous. Anisotropy affects
almost every property of a material but those properties most affected are marked ‘‡’
in the list above. In certain clearly anisotropic materials, such as schists, slates and
shales, and layered sediments, variations in material properties due to anisotropy may
be of vital importance in certain projects.
2.3.1
Types of Test
There are very many different tests which are used to measure the properties listed
above. The properties which are measured may be divided into three groups. These
are:
(cid:1) Material properties – which are obtained by such observations or laboratory testing
as give a scientifically valid result whatever appropriate test procedure is applied.
The instrumentation used to measure these properties will influence the accuracy
of the result. Examples of such properties might be mineral content, chemical con-
tent and density.
(cid:1) Test properties – which are measured by observing the reaction of the test specimen
to a given test procedure. The property measured is recognised as a property in
materials science but the result obtained depends very much on test procedure. Ex-
amples of such properties are permeability, porosity, strength, modulus of deforma-
tion, cohesion and so forth.
(cid:1) Empirical properties – which are the result of performing the test in a standard way
using particular apparatus on a particular style of test specimen. These tests are of-
2.3 · Properties and their Measurement 29
ten associated with parameters which are not recognised in physical science but are
useful with regard to a particular engineering process. Examples might be such ‘prop-
erties’ as ASTM Toughness, the Slake Durability Index, the Los Angeles abrasion value,
and the Polished Stone Value.
Many tests are difficult and expensive to undertake and in the beginning of an in-
vestigation it is sometimes sufficient to have an approximate idea of the value of certain
properties. The results of some easily and cheaply executed tests may have a relation-
ship to the results of more complex and expensive tests. If this relationship is known
then the cheaper test may be undertaken to obtain an approximate idea of the value
of an otherwise more expensively obtained property. Such tests are called index tests.
2.3.2
Limitations of Testing
The reaction of a ground mass to an engineering process depends partly on the engi-
neering behaviour of the materials of which the ground mass is composed. Material
behaviour is determined by testing in which the intent is to subject samples of mate-
rials, in the condition that they are found underground, to the changes in conditions
which will arise as a consequence of engineering construction. This intent is seldom
realised firstly because it is almost impossible to extract a sample from the ground in
a truly undisturbed condition and secondly because, for practical reasons, testing must
be undertaken in a much shorter time than that in which the changes consequent to
engineering construction take place. Clearly the condition of the sample tested is also
of significance to the accuracy of the test result, which would be influenced by any
flaws developed as a result of sample extraction and preparation. In particular, differ-
ences in moisture content between the material in situ and as a laboratory sample have
major influence on test results. As well as these factors the way in which the tests are
performed is of importance.
2.3.3
Size and Shape of Sample
In the simple uniaxial compressive strength test, the test specimen is usually a solid
cylinder. The distribution of stress within the specimen is such that failure under uni-
form load equal to that exerted by the test machine is not expected for samples whose
length to diameter ratio is less than 2:1. In soil mechanics this ratio is generally ac-
cepted and also mostly in rock mechanics. However, in rock mechanics there is no
generally accepted standard for testing, although some recommendations (such as the
“Suggested Methods” of the International Society for Rock Mechanics, Brown 1981)
are widely adopted.
Special shapes of sample have been devised to give more reliable results for certain
tests. The ‘dog bone’ sample in Fig. 2.5 is intended to give tensile and compressive
strength values free of the complications caused by stress distribution in the sample,
but the cost of preparation of such shapes is usually prohibitive.
It is obvious also that the size of the sample must be considerably greater than the
grain size of the material. Thus, for example, a 50 mm diameter, 100 mm long speci-
30 CHAPTER 2 · Geological Materials
men of basalt would be acceptable for a strength test, but this size of sample would be
inappropriate for a coarse conglomerate in which the size of an individual ‘grain’
might be a significant proportion of the size of the specimen. Test specimens are
mostly specimens without fractures and are thence described as specimens of in-
tact rock.
2.3.4
Rate of Loading, Testing Machine and Platens
The rate of application of load on the test specimen has a significant effect on the value
of failure strength measured (Price and Knill 1966). Almost all rates of loading ap-
plied in the laboratory are far higher than the rates likely to be applied in engineering
construction, so that to some extent, all values are false. Usually, the rate which is
adopted is the slowest which can be used in the circumstances. Sometimes testing stan-
dards or recommendations suggest rates to be used.
Testing machines may be regarded as either “soft”, i.e. “flexible” or “stiff”. The test
frames of the former deforming significantly under load so that, at the first crack in
the test specimen the release of strain energy from the machine causes explosive fail-
ure of the specimen. Stiff machines were built so massively that there was little defor-
mation of the frame. Some differences in strength results have been observed between
the different machine types, but they are not very significant unless the tests are high
load tests in rock mechanics or, for the particular project, post failure behaviour must
be examined. Nowadays the ‘stiffness’ is created by servo-controlled systems that al-
low the deformation of the sample to control the rate at which it is loaded, so avoiding
explosive failures.
In rock mechanics, platen conditions are important. Results may be affected by dif-
ferences in metal or other material used for these plates. A more basic problem arises
from the constraints on sample diametral expansion imposed by friction developing
between platen and sample when their stiffness is not the same. This has been par-
tially solved by the design of platens incorporating devices to allow the sample to di-
late radially but such devices are too complex for standard use.
2.3.5
Standards
Results of tests on materials will vary depending upon the test procedure applied and
this variation may be of engineering significance. To be assured that results of tests
from different laboratories are comparable tests are undertaken following established
standards or norms set up by national or international bodies. Examples of such
organisations are the British Standards Institution (BSI), the American Society of Test-
ing and Materials (ASTM), the International Standards Organisation (ISO), the Inter-
national Society of Rock Mechanics (ISRM), the Deutsche Industrie-Norm (DIN) and
the Nederlands Normalisatie Instituut (NNI). Not all tests are standardised and stan-
dards for particular tests vary, usually but slightly, from country to country. All rou-
tine tests should be performed to a standard and that standard recorded in reports
and scientific papers.
2.4 · Density and Unit Weight 31
2.4
Density and Unit Weight
Most rocks and all soils can be regarded as containing voids between grains. These
voids may be filled with water, air or both. Thus, three conditions are possible – dry,
partially saturated and saturated. The in situ or ‘bulk’ density of the material is deter-
mined by the relative proportions of mineral particles, water, and air in a given vol-
ume of material, and the specific gravity of the mineral particles.
Density (ρ) is the amount of mass in a given volume and the units are Mgm–3. Unit
weight (γ) is the weight of a unit volume, and the units are Nm–3. Usually, because the
Newton is a small force, unit weight is expressed in kNm–3. Formulae appropriate to
the calculation of various parameters associated with density and unit weight are given
in Table 2.3.
Table 2.3. Formulae in common use for parameters related to density and unit weight
32 CHAPTER 2 · Geological Materials
Most granular soils have a wide range of unit weight within which the soil may occur
in situ. Figure 2.3 shows a ‘theoretical’ soil composed of perfectly spherical uniform
diameter grains at minimum bulk density with, for this soil, the largest possible spaces
between the particles, so that the void ratio is at maximum while the bulk density is
minimal. If the soil is compacted to maximum bulk density by vibration and/or weight
of material above, the particles will close together, giving minimum size pore spaces
and void ratio. The in situ density lies usually somewhere between maximum and
minimum; the relative density expresses where the in situ density lies between mini-
mum and maximum values for a particular soil and is a measure of the state of com-
paction which the soil has reached.
Relative Density (R.D.) may be therefore expressed in terms of void ratio (e) or unit
weight (γ):

where, for a particular sample, γ =minimum possible unit weigh, γ =maximum

possible unit weight and γ =in situ unit weight.
in situ
Relative density assumes that the maximum density is achieved without alteration
to the size and shape of the grains, i.e. the grains are not fractured and broken into
smaller pieces by compaction and that the grains are solid, i.e. they do not contain
pores as do the grains of pumice and chalk. The degree of compaction achieved by a
natural deposit may be classified by relation to the relative density. Terminology is
given in Table 2.4.
Since relative density suggests the degree of compaction a granular soil has achieved
relative to the maximum it might achieve it indicates the settlement that can take place
under extra load, such as that of a foundation. In Fig. 2.3 there are, in two dimensions,
four point contacts between the grains at minimum density and six contacts at maxi-
mum density, indicating an increase in shear resistance of granular materials at higher
degrees of compaction (Table 2.4). Because relative density relates to both settlement

Generally, relative density is measured using the Standard Penetration Test (SPT) in
boreholes and the SPT-‘N’-value is much used in foundation design. In trial pits it may
be assessed approximately by the resistance of the soil to excavation. It is also an im-
portant parameter in the assessment of the potential for liquefaction of sands during
earthquakes.
2.5
Porosity and Permeability
Porosity is a measure of the voids in sediment and rock, and the masses they form.
Permeability is a measure of the extent to which these voids are connected.
2.5.1
Porosity
Porosity is a measure of the volume of voids in a material or mass. In materials poros-
ity depends upon the space between grains; in masses it would also include any space
provided by open fissures and joints.
(2.4)
Intergranular porosity is often determined in the laboratory by comparison between
dry and saturated weights of the sample. To become fully saturated, voids must be in
contact, and both interconnections and voids must be large enough to allow the flow
of water under reasonable pressures. One or both of these conditions is often not sat-
isfied, particularly for fine grained materials, and the results of such tests are prop-
erly described as apparent porosity. Note that the execution of the porosity test may
damage the sample. There are some porous rocks, such as vesicular basalts, that are
porous but whose porosity cannot be measured by conventional means because the
voids are not in contact i.e. the material is impermeable.
34 CHAPTER 2 · Geological Materials
2.5.2
Permeability
Permeability is a general term which describes the ability of a porous medium to al-
low the flow of fluid through it. For flow to take place through a saturated material
there must be a difference in total head. In engineering geology the usual concern is
with the flow of water through a granular soil or rock mass. The head of water h is the
height of the water level above the point at which the head is measured. Thus, the pres-
sure of water at that point p=hγ, where γ =unit weight of water.
w w
In 1856, Darcy conducted laboratory experiments to analyse the flow of water
through sand, and showed that, if Q is the quantity of water passing through a sand
tube of cross-sectional area A in time t, then the specific discharge q of water flow is
given by:
(2.5)
In this experiment the flow was intergranular and non-turbulent; these are condi-
tions most likely to be encountered in engineering geology except where flow is fast
as in gravel, open rough fractures in rock or through some clays where the clay min-
erals may interfere with free flow.
Darcy also showed that the specific discharge was directly proportional to the hy-
draulic gradient (i), which is the loss of total head per unit length of flow (Fig. 2.4).
Thus q∝i and q=Ki, where the constant of proportionality K (the coefficient of per-
meability) is dependent upon both the properties of the porous medium and the fluid.
Since the fluid is water, K is also called the hydraulic conductivity. The properties of
the fluid which effect K are fluid density and viscosity, which change with tempera-
ture. K is therefore temperature dependent. Thus

Q=AKi (2.6)
and
(2.7)
where v=a theoretical velocity of the flow across the area A. The coefficient K has
units of velocity.
In soil mechanics and rock mechanics the usual unit for K is ms–1, but in other
applications common units are mms–1, cms–1, myear–1, ftday–1. The constant of pro-
portionality, K is determined by the properties of both fluid and medium. Guide val-
ues of hydraulic conductivity for rocks and soils are given in Table 2.5. For the medium,
the properties which determine the rate of flow are mean grain diameter (d), distri-

ability) of rock and soil

bution of grain sizes, nature of grain packing and degree of interconnection of the
pore spaces. For a particular medium, these properties will not change and therefore
will be the same regardless of which fluid is flowing. This is a property which is exclu-
sively that of the medium, and is termed the specific or intrinsic permeability. The
constant of proportionality K can now be re-defined, thus:
(2.8)
where density ρ and viscosity µ are properties of the fluid, and Cd2 is a function of the
medium alone. C is another constant of proportionality and is a function of the me-
dium properties other than mean grain diameter which determines d2. Consequently, the
intrinsic permeability=Cd2. Confusion arises, because the designated symbol for in-
trinsic permeability is k, which is the symbol used in soil and rock mechanics for coeffi-
cient of permeability, which more properly should be called hydraulic conductivity.
Intrinsic permeability is used mostly in the petroleum industry, where the fluid under
consideration may be petroleum, water or even methane or a mixture of all. The units of
intrinsic permeability are m2, but since values in this unit are very small, petroleum engi-
neers have adopted the darcy as the unit (1 darcy=0.987 µm2 and 1 µm2=10–12 m2).
2.6
Strength
All geological materials have some ability to resist failure under the action of stresses;
this is their strength. Most values quoted as the ‘strength of’ a certain material are the
stresses at failure, the ultimate failure strength. Usually, testing is done on small samples
in the laboratory. Strengths measured are:
(cid:1) uniaxial (or unconfined) compressive strength, which is the stress at failure of a sam-
ple under compression;
(cid:1) uniaxial (or unconfined) tensile strength which is the stress at failure of a sample
under tension;
(cid:1) triaxial strength, which is the stress at failure of a sample that is confined. This is
usually accomplished by placing the sample under compression while it is restrained
laterally by a minor horizontal stress.
The units of strength are force/area, for example kgfcm–2, Nmm–2, kNm–2, MNm–2.
Recently it has become fashionable to use pascals, particularly for compressive strength
(1 pascal (Pa)=1 Nm–2).
2.6.1
Water Content and Drainage
The effects of water content and drainage conditions on test results are best under-
stood in relation to intergranular stresses (effective stresses). At a point at depth d below
the surface which is overlain by saturated material of unit weight γ , the total stress

at d=dγ . The pressure of water in the pores between grains of material is dγ .
sat water
Total pressures are reduced by water pressures to give intergranular pressures, so that
intergranular pressure=dγ –dγ .
sat water
When a saturated sample is loaded in a test so that no water can drain from the sample
(an undrained test), the test load is taken partly by the intergranular contacts and partly
by the pore water. The pore water is virtually incompressible; increasing strain on and
shortening of the sample cannot now produce reduction of pore size and greater com-
paction of the sample, but can only cause pore water to push between grains, lower inter-
granular friction and cause failure at lower stress levels than would otherwise be the case.
All undrained tests on fully saturated soils whose particles are not bound together, give
values of friction equal to zero. The fact that some undrained triaxial tests on these mate-
rials give values of ϕ above zero is because they are not tested in a truly fully saturated
condition and some water movement into unsaturated pore spaces is possible. For the same
reasons, saturated rock gives lower strength values than dry rock.
2.6.2
Strength Tests
Test arrangements and formulae to calculate strength are given in Fig. 2.5.
Compressive Strength
This is the stress (load/area) at which a sample of material (cylinders in the case of
soil or rock, cubes in the case of concrete) fails under compressive stress.
Tensile Strength
This is the stress at which a sample of material fails under tensile stress. Tensile strength
may be measured directly, but in practical terms it is difficult to do. In rocks it may be
measured indirectly by the Brazilian test or the pierced disc test. A further variation
of these tests is the Point Load test, which is now used as a field method for the deter-
mination of rock strength.
The Brazilian test attempts to measure tensile strength by developing tension across
the diameter of a rock disc which is being subjected to compression through a verti-
cal load. Because the tensile strength of rock is between one quarter and one tenth of
the compressive strength, the tensile stresses being developed horizontally as a result
of vertical compressive stress should be enough to cause tensile failure before failure
in compression can occur. In fact, intense contact compressive stresses between sample
and platen may cause local fracturing which then proceeds from the circumference
towards the tensioned centre. The values of tensile strength measured are thus incor-
rect. A modified Brazilian test using curved platens to overcome stress concentrations
has been tried (Mellor and Hawkes 1971).
Shear Strength
Material loaded under both major and minor stresses fails in shear. The shear strength
of a material under shear load depends upon confining stress and is not a unique value.
38 CHAPTER 2 · Geological Materials
Fig. 2.5. Simple laboratory tests on rock samples. UCS and UTS=unconfined compressive strength and
unconfined tensile strength
2.6 · Strength 39
Unconfined, or uniaxial, strengths may be considered as shear strengths under no
confining stress, a situation which rarely occurs in nature. Shear strength is described
in terms of parameters c (cohesion) and ϕ (angle of shearing resistance).
Consider a block of weight W resting on a horizontal plane (Fig. 2.6). The weight
W produces an equal and opposite reaction R, without any tendency for the block to
move. If a horizontal force S is applied and increased until the block is just about to
slide, the reaction, or resultant force R, will be inclined at an angle α to the vertical, so
the horizontal component of R is S=Rsinα and the vertical component of R is
W=Rcosα. The angle α will have increased to a limiting value ϕ. At this point the
horizontal force resisting sliding, S=Wtanϕ. The parameter tanϕ is known as the
coefficient of friction.
Shear strength can be seen to be related to frictional resistance within a material.
However, materials whose grains are bonded together may have additional strength
produced by the adhesion or cementing between grains. Coulomb’s law states that:
σ τ=c+σ n(tanϕ) (2.9)
where: σ τ=shear stress at failure (shear strength)=S/A; c=cohesion (adhesion or
cementing); σ =normal stress on sliding plane=W/A, and ϕ=angle of frictional
n
resistance.
According to these properties, three types of geological material may exist. These
are:
(cid:1) c=0 (materials exhibiting no cohesion, such as dry sand)
(cid:1) c and ϕ materials (soils and rocks with both cohesion and internal friction)
(cid:1) ϕ=0 (materials exhibiting no internal friction)
In the shear box test (Fig. 2.5), shear force and normal force are applied directly,
and it is only necessary to plot graphs of shear stress against normal stress, and shear
strength (Fig. 2.7) against shear displacement to find c and ϕ and then peak and re-
sidual shear strengths. Peak strength may be defined as the maximum resistance of
the sample to shear force while the residual strength is the resistance of the failed shear
surface after considerable movement.
Shear boxes may be used to determine c and ϕ on intact material samples (Fig. 2.5),
or along existing discontinuities which must be aligned along the plane of shearing in
the box.

of peak and residual strength
parameters
Shear strength parameters of intact rock are difficult to measure, because loads and
strengths are generally high, at least compared to soils, but it can be done (Fig. 2.5).
Most shear testing on rock is done on discontinuities such as joints, which requires
the sample to be cast into a form which fits the box. To determine the shear strength
at failure, shear displacement must be plotted against shear stress. A peak failure load
is normally clearly evident (Fig. 2.7a). After failure shear stress can fall to an approxi-
mately constant value. This residual strength value may be plotted on the shear
strength/normal stress graph to find residual values of c and ϕ, which are designated
to c and ϕ and may be determined for intact material or for existing discontinuities
r r
(Fig. 2.7b). The ring shear apparatus may be used for determination of residual val-
ues for soils. The shear displacement is circular and limited only by the length of time
over which the test is conducted.
2.6 · Strength 41
Triaxial Strength
To try to determine the effect that stresses caused by surface construction would have
on underlying soils or rocks it would seem sensible to take samples from various depths
below the construction, subject them to the appropriate confining overburden pres-
sure and thence impose the additional vertical construction stresses appropriate to
the sample depths. The triaxial cell has been designed to do this.
In the triaxial test (Fig. 2.8) the cylindrical sample is placed in a test cell which is
constructed so as to allow the application of an all round hydraulic pressure on the
sample and also the application of a load which will bring the sample to failure. The
test sample is surrounded by an impervious membrane to prevent contact with the
cell fluid. The hydraulic pressure is kept constant for each test and the deviator stress
(σ–σ) increased until failure occurs. The Mohr circle diagram is used to plot the
1 3
shear and normal stresses.
There are very many possible variations of the triaxial test. A truly accurate test would
impose the construction load at the rate with which construction takes place and allow
for drainage of the sample. Such testing is expensive, so a variety of tests are possible ap-
proaching reality with an increasing degree of complexity and expense. In the simplest,
the quick undrained test, samples are tested without drainage, as this gives a measure of
their strength when weakest, and without the measurement of their pore water pressures
(which takes time). The triaxial test is not confined to soils and increasing strength of
the apparatus allows stronger materials to be tested (Hoek and Franklin 1968).

2.7
Deformation
If a sample of material is placed under load, it deforms; that is, it changes in shape
and perhaps also in volume. If, when the load is removed, the deformation instantly
and completely disappears, the material may be said to be elastic. In this case the rela-
tionship between stress and strain is often linear. If a cylinder of length l is loaded by
a stress σ applied to the top of the cylinder, the length may be shortened by an amount
dl. The strain ε is expressed by:
(2.10)
For elastic materials, strain is related to stress by Hooke’s law, so that:
(2.11)
E is commonly referred to as Young’s Modulus.
If an elastic cube is deformed by shear stress, the cube changes its shape to become
a rhomb. The small angle dθ which lies between the sides of the cube and that of the
rhomb is a measure of the shear strain. The stress/strain relationship is given by the
Modulus of Rigidity (G).
(2.12)
If the elastic solid is changed in volume due to a change in hydrostatic pressure,
then the stress/strain relationship is given by the Bulk Modulus (K).
(2.13)
If a cylinder of Young’s Modulus E is shortened by axial load, it will bulge outwards.
If the shortening of length is dl, and the increase in diameter is dd, then the ratio of
these strains is given by Poisson’s ratio v:
(2.14)
2.7 · Deformation 43
2.7.1
Types of Rock Deformation
Few, if any, materials behave in a truly elastic manner, and various styles of deforma-
tion may be observed from the stress/strain curve plotted during a load test. If the
plot is more or less linear, then the material may be described as elastic. If not, the
material may be described as ‘plastic’ or some mixture of elastic-plastic behaviour (Fig. 2.9).
It is then prudent to speak of the Modulus of Deformation rather than a Young’s modu-
lus. The moduli chosen for use in deformation calculations depend mostly on the lev-
els of stress expected in the engineering situation (Fig. 2.9). See also Table 2.6.
Creep. If a specimen is loaded to failure in a testing machine, the test is often completed in
a very short time, and the strength value measured may be described as the instantaneous
or short-term strength. If the same specimen were instead to be subjected to a lower stress
for a long period of time, it may be found that the rock fails by a process known as creep, at
a stress sometimes very much lower than that which gave the instantaneous strength. Val-
ues of long-term strength may be as low as 25% of instantaneous strength. In general terms
the greater the initial stress the shorter the time to creep failure. Recognition of the effects
of creep on rock strength is important in the design of mine pillars, particularly if the
magnitude of constant overburden load stress is a high proportion of the instantaneous
strength. In civil engineering, the loads applied to rock materials are usually but a small
fraction of their instantaneous failure strength so unless the rock is very weak and/or the
loads are unusually high, there is little need to be concerned about the effects of creep.
2.7.2
Consolidation of Soils
Application of load to soils produces ‘consolidation’. In the case of clayey soils, the load
is carried initially by both the solid particles of the soil and the water within the pore
spaces. In time, with continual application of the load, the water will slowly be driven
out of the material. This is a slow process because of the low hydraulic conductivity
(permeability) of the clay, but as the water is driven out, there will be an increase in

effective stress as the load is carried more and more by the soil particles. The result
will be a decrease in volume of the soil i.e.consolidation, the magnitude of which is
related to the load. Engineers are concerned to know by how much a clay will consoli-
date, and in what time, so that the amount of settlement of a structure supported by
the soil can be determined. The amount of consolidation may be expressed by the co-
efficient of volume change, m :
v
(2.15)
The higher the value of m the more the soil will consolidate (Table 2.7).
v
Consolidation is also a natural process. In an uninterrupted sequence of deposi-
tion any soil will consolidate under the load of a younger bed laid down on top of it.
Such soils are said to be normally consolidated. These are mostly younger soils. Beds
of older clays may, after their deposition, have been subject to erosion so that some of
the upper beds have been removed. The beds remaining then display consolidation
characteristics that are not appropriate to the overburden that presently covers them.
They are then said to be over-consolidated. Over-consolidation can also result from
the weight of the ice sheets that covered glacial clays during the Pleistocene and melted
at the end of this period. The differences in consolidation characteristics depend upon
the geological history of a deposit. Thus settlement of structures may be expected to
be much greater on younger normally consolidated soils than on the older over- or
geologically consolidated soils. It should be noted that consolidation, as described in
soil mechanics, is but the early stage of diagenesis.
To predict the effect that settlement will have on an engineering structure it is also
necessary to know how quickly this will take place so that the structure may be de-

signed to accommodate these movements. Tests are thus conducted to determine both
the coefficient of volume change, m , to deduce the magnitude of settlement, and the

coefficient of consolidation, C , (expressed in units of area/time) to deduce the rates

of settlement.
2.8
Abrasiveness
Quartz is a common rock forming mineral and, because of its resistance to weath-
ering, one of the commonest components in soils. It is also one of the hardest min-
erals, being number 7 on Moh’s scale of mineral hardness, implying that it will
scratch most other common minerals. It will also scratch steel. There are a num-
ber of engineering processes which involve cutting rock using hard picks, teeth,
bits etc. The economy of the operation may depend upon the amount of wear on
the cutting tools, which have to be replaced when they become blunt. This wear
will depend upon the quantity, grain size and shape of the quartz in the rock
or soil, how firmly the quartz is cemented into the matrix (expressed by the rock
or soil strength), the properties of the cutting device and the mechanics of cut-
ting.
A number of tests have been developed to assess abrasiveness of a rock. Most in-
volve pressing a steel pin against the rock with uniform force, scratching the rock for
a specified distance and observing the loss of steel from the pin. The Cerchar test in-
volves moving a specially shaped pin a short distance over a prepared rock sample
and thence measuring weight loss. In the pin-on-disc test a specially prepared pin is
pressed against a rotating disc of specimen rock for a given number of revolutions. In
both of these empirical tests the quality of the steel making up the pin is specified.
Relative abrasiveness may be assessed from knowledge of rock mineral content and
strength. Schimazek and Knatz (1970), using a pin-on-disc test, developed the ‘F’ value
(a wear factor), using the formula:
(2.16)
where Qtz.Eq.=quartz equivalent or content (% by volume), d=mean diameter of
quartz grains (mm), and BTS=Brazilian tensile strength (MPa).
The higher the value of F the greater the weight loss of the pin and, it may be pre-
sumed, the greater the wear on cutting tools. The reader is warned that the subject of
46 CHAPTER 2 · Geological Materials
abrasion is one of great complexity relating to the science of tribology, which deals
with friction, wear and lubrication and is thus clearly of importance in mechanical
engineering. Verhoef (1997) has reviewed the subject of wear on cutting tools and the
form of site investigations necessary to gather appropriate data to attack these prob-
lems while Deketh (1995) has reviewed abrasion tests.
2.9
Environmental Reactivity
Rocks and soils underground exist within their environment, which may be defined
in terms of stress, temperature, moisture content etc. When ground materials are ex-
posed the environment will change and the ground materials may themselves change
in response. Stress release may induce rebound and cracking but also the minerals
forming the materials may change. Some rocks, for example shales and mudstones,
may on exposure rapidly weather and decay and begin to revert to their original muds.
Slaking tests, in which small samples of rock are subjected to repeated wetting and
drying, may demonstrate susceptibility to weathering if the sample breaks up into
smaller pieces after a number of wet/dry cycles. The slake durability test (Franklin
and Chandra 1972) subjects samples of rock to both wetting, drying and some degree
of abrasion.
Many minerals contained in materials become unsuitable if subjected to changes
in their environment as the consequence of engineering. Thus, for example, pyrite and
marcasite will suffer expansion as the result of oxidation on exposure to air, moisture
and perhaps bacterial action and higher temperatures. If these minerals are present
in rock (and they are quite common in some Carboniferous shales and mudstones)
they will expand when exposed. This could result in upward heave of foundations built
on these rocks, changes in the stability of tunnel walls etc. Other minerals such as chal-
cedony and chert will react to the cement in concrete if they are present in rocks used
for concrete aggregate.
2.10
Index Tests
Certain tests require little in the way of sample preparation and are so simple to con-
duct that the characteristics of soils and rocks, regardless of how complex these are,
have been linked to them. Thus a simple test can indicate a range of material charac-
ters and the behaviour to expect from them, such as strength, permeability, and likely
change in the presence of water. These tests are called Index tests.
2.10.1
Soils
Grading
Granular materials are described with reference to their particle size and grading
curves. Grading curves are obtained by passing the material through a series of sieves
down to fine sand size. Silts and clays are graded by observing the velocity of fall of
2.10 · Index Tests 47
the grains through water. The result of particle size analysis is a grading curve (Fig. 2.1).
Reference may be made to the effective size (D ) of a material. This is the largest di-
10
ameter in the lower 10% of the material. The uniformity coefficient is D /D . The
60 10
value of the grading curve as an index is that correctly naming the soil leads to asso-
ciations with soil behaviour which have been learnt by general experience.
Atterberg Limits (also called Consistency Limits)
An important test for clayey soils is the Atterberg limit or consistency test (BS1377).
This examines the effect of changes of moisture content on the plasticity of clay soils.
In the worst condition, clay could be just a suspension of clay particles in water,
which would then act as a rather dense fluid. If the water is allowed to dry out the
point will be reached where the material is a very soft solid and exhibits a small shear
strength. This limiting value of moisture content is the liquid limit (LL). As further
moisture dries out from the material it becomes stronger. Above a certain moisture
content the soil will behave plastically, that is it will deform under stress but not re-
gain its shape when the stress is removed. If the moisture content is less than this plastic
limit (PL) the soil, when loaded, may break with a brittle fracture. The plasticity index
(PI) is the range of moisture content within which the soil acts as a plastic material.
Thus:
PI=LL–PL (2.17)
2.10.2
Rocks
Point Load Test
Engineering in rock is usually concerned with deformation of rock mass rather than
strength of rock material, and material strength tests serve only as indicators of qual-
ity. The Point Load test (Broch and Franklin 1972) has been used since 1972 and has
become the most popular of the simpler techniques. It is used in laboratory and field
for logging mechanical strength of rock specimens obtained from boreholes sunk by
rotary core drilling. A core is loaded between two ‘points’ which are steel cones sub-
tending an angle of 60° and terminating in a hemisphere of 5 mm radius. The core is
usually loaded across a diameter. The test specimen should be at least 1.5 times as long
as the diameter. The strength value obtained from the Point Load test varies accord-
ing to core diameter. In the standard test, results are converted to a standard 50 mm
diameter core by the use of a conversion chart.
Correlations between Point Load strength (I ) and unconfined compressive strength
S
have been derived from experimental evidence, but unfortunately the multiplying fac-
tor appears to vary from one rock type to another. Bowden et al. (1998) record authors
giving correlation factors (UCS/I ) ranging from 4 to 50, with the majority falling in
S
the range 10 to 30. For stronger rocks correlation factors of about 24 seem reasonable.
For weaker rocks, into which the points may sink before the rock breaks, about half
this value may be appropriate. The Point Load test is useful but it has a number of
problems (Brook 1985; Price et al. 1978). It may also be noted that, in sedimentary rocks,
48 CHAPTER 2 · Geological Materials
much Point Load testing takes place along the bedding, the direction of greatest weak-
ness and thus good correlation with the unconfined compressive strength, measured
at right angles to the bedding, seems unlikely.
Enthusiastic and unrestrained Point Load testing on cores may destroy core which
could have been used for more complex testing requiring the 2:1 height/diameter ra-
tio. The combination of these problems suggests that other rock strength index tests
are to be preferred and the use of the Point Load test on core be discontinued.
Block Punch Test
The Block Punch test is a test, developed for use as an index test, in which a thin plate
or disc of rock is sheared by a punch device (Fig. 2.5). The Block Punch Index (BPI) is
given by:
(2.18)
where W=failure load; t=disc or plate thickness and L and L are the lengths of the
1 2
shear planes.
Extensive testing (van der Schrier 1988) has given correlations with unconfined
compressive strength (UCS=±6×BPI). The accuracy of the test seems to be as good
as the Point Load strength test as an index for unconfined compressive strength and
it has the advantage that thin plates or discs, about 10 mm thick, can be cut by dia-
mond saw from small pieces or cores of rock. Thus cores too fragmented to fulfil the
Point Load test specimen dimension criteria can be tested while longer cores can be
tested without destroying those big enough for more complex testing.
Schmidt Hammer Test
The Schmidt hammer is a device designed to estimate the strength of concrete (but
which can be used on rock) by measuring the rebound of a spring-impelled hammer
striking on the surface of the mass. Several varieties of the hammer differ in the en-
ergy imparted by the spring – the L-type is generally the most satisfactory for rocks.
The rebound number is converted to unconfined compressive strength by means of
graphs, which are based on laboratory testing evidence. Correlation between rebound
number and UCS is not absolute, and rather like the use of Point Load Strength index,
it might be better used for comparison between rocks if the link to UCS were avoided.
The value of rebound is affected by the attitude of the hammer, whether vertically
pointing down or up, horizontal or inclined.
Velocity Tests
The velocity of waves through a material can give some indication of other properties of
the material, such as strength, density and elastic moduli. Measurements may be made
on intact specimens in the laboratory, or on rock masses in the field. A comparison of
laboratory and field velocities may give an indication of rock mass properties.
2.11 · Range of Values for Material Properties 49
The velocities of waves through a cylindrical sample of material can be measured
accurately. The pulse generated at one end of the specimen is picked up at the other
end, and recorded. For a known density the elastic constants can be calculated:

Slaking and Slake Durability
Slaking tests consist of cyclically saturating and drying a fragment of rock and ob-
serving its loss of weight after a number of cycles. The slake durability test (Franklin
and Chandra 1972) includes an element of erosion for rock fragments are placed in a
rotating drum. The test is suitable only for weak or weathered rocks there being gen-
erally too little effect on strong fresh rock.
Combined Parameter Indices
An index may be established using more than one property. An important index is the
ductility number (sometimes referred to as the brittleness index) which is the ratio
UCS/UTS (Fig. 2.5). Values of ductility number of more than 15 indicate a rock which
will shatter when impacted by cutter tools. Values below about 9 indicate that the rock
will crush under tool impact. The brittle/ductile behaviour boundary is of great im-
portance in rock cutting.

Range of Values for Material Properties
Although the mechanical values for a rock or a soil can vary considerably, they do
exhibit a characteristic range of values and this range becomes the sort of value that
“would be expected”.

2.11.1
Soils
Some typical values for the properties of granular soils are given in Tables 2.8 and 2.9.
Ranges of shear strengths for clays are given in Table 2.2.
The properties of clay soils are very dependent upon their moisture content and
they can be much more complex, mineralogically, than more granular soils. Conse-
quently the range of values of properties is much greater (Table 2.10). There are some
special ‘problem’ soils encountered in the world, which give particular engineering dif-
ficulties. In many cases the properties are due to the mode of origin and/or subsequent
geological history, in which environment often plays a leading role. Some examples
are given below.
Loess
Loess is a yellow, calcareous, porous, wind blown silt, characteristic of Pleistocene se-
quences in several large areas on every continent. Generally more than 80% of the loess
particles consist of quartz, 10 to 20% of feldspar and up to 20% of carbonate. The per-
centage of clay size particles may range up to 15%. The structure of the material is
dominated by the fine quartz particles, between twenty and fifty micrometres in length.
The open structure of the quartz particles is often strengthened by clay minerals, and
cemented by calcium carbonate. The whole fabric is essentially delicate, which makes
the structure liable to sudden collapse. Loess soils cause great difficulties for civil en-
gineers. They tend to collapse on saturation under load, or at least when the moisture
content is changed they consolidate very rapidly – 95% of settlement can occur in ten
minutes. The effect is local, which can lead to very large differential settlements of
structures founded on them. Similar loss of strength may occur after disturbance by
other means, for example by large loads or earthquakes.
Sensitive Clays
The shear strength of an undisturbed clay is generally greater than the shear strength
of the same remoulded clay at the same moisture content. There is a loss of strength
on remoulding, and the ratio of the undisturbed to remoulded strength is called the

sensitivity (S) of the clay. The measure of sensitivity proposed by Terzaghi is the ra-
t
tio of the peak undisturbed strength (C) to the remoulded strength (C). Thus:
r
(2.22)
All clays show some degree of sensitivity; the term ‘quick’ is applied to clays which
have a sensitivity of over 16 (Skempton and Northey 1952). The more sensitive the clay,
52 CHAPTER 2 · Geological Materials
the more difficult the engineering problems posed. The term ‘quick clay’ is sometimes
used to denote clays of such sensitivity that they behave as viscous liquids when in a
remoulded state. Small earthquakes may trigger of a mass movement which may be
responsible for great loss of life and damage to property.
Sabkha
The term ‘sabkha’ is used in Arabic speaking countries to mean ‘salt encrusted flat
surface’, of which there are many in coastal and inland areas of Arabia, particularly
along the southern shore of the Persian Gulf. In engineering geology and civil engi-
neering, sabkha is now used as a description of geological material originating in
particular environments of deposition, and consisting of sandy or silty sediment which
is at least partly cemented by salts, usually calcium carbonate and calcium sulphate,
but often with a variety of other salts present also. Most geologists apply the term only
to the coastal environment. At times of rain, flash flood or extra high tidal level this
crust may soften very rapidly.
The geotechnical difficulties may be summarised as follows:
(cid:1) very variable bearing capacity, vertically;
(cid:1) very variable deformability (compressibility);
(cid:1) rapid change due to growth or change, for example hydration, of new or existing
minerals;
(cid:1) effect of salt on concrete and steel.
Duricrust
If, in a semi-arid climate, the ground-water table lies not far below surface, water drawn
to the surface will evaporate and deposit any minerals held in solution within the near
surface materials, resulting in their cementation. If the material is already rock then
pore spaces become filled and make the rock stronger. The minerals in solution may
be leached from materials far below surface so duricrust layers may be underlain by
leached material, weaker than it was in its original condition.
The cementing material is most commonly calcite so that form of duricrust is
termed calcrete. However, a silicious cement gives silcrete, a ferruginous cement
ferrocrete and so forth, while their are many local names for these materials. They are
widespread in many parts of the world and much attention has been drawn to their
occurrence in the Middle East (Fookes 1978). Thicknesses of duricrust may range from
a few centimetres to several metres with considerable changes in thickness in but a
short horizontal distance.
Duricrusts are formed near surface and commonly near the sea but there have been
considerable variations in climate and sea level in Pleistocene and Holocene times.
Because of this duricrusts may now be found underwater (Dennis 1978) or above sea
level along shore lines. It is thus important, in a site investigation, to establish the re-
cent geological history of the area under investigation to determine whether or not
duricrust is likely to occur.
2.11 · Range of Values for Material Properties 53
Glacial Soils
There is a very large range of glacial soils whose nature and properties vary accord-
ing to the material available, the environment of transport, i.e. on top of, within, or
near the base of the glacier, and the environment of deposition. Thus, tills are soils
deposited directly by the ice and fluvio-glacial soils are deposited by meltwater either
close to the ice front, i.e. periglacial, or at greater distance, i.e. proglacial.
The term till is used in preference to the more commonly used term ‘boulder clay’
to which it is synonymous. Boulder clay is a generic term rather than a lithological
description, but it is generally misunderstood by engineers who may complain with
justification that the material described as boulder clay on the map has neither boul-
ders nor clay as constituents. The character of till is determined by a number of fac-
tors:
(cid:1) the position of transport – on or in the glacier
(cid:1) the nature of the bedrock over which the glacier is passing
(cid:1) the nature of the rock through which contributory glaciers have passed
(cid:1) the mode of deposition of the material
Some tills originate from the ‘plastering’ of sediment transported at or very near
the base of the glacier and dropped on to the bedrock. Such material would be over-
ridden by the ice and if clayey would be over-consolidated as a result. The material is
likely to consist of finely divided ‘rock flour’ produced by the grinding action of the
ice. If the bedrock was shale or mudstone, the proportion of clay mineral in the till
will be high, and the till will be plastic. If the bedrock is arenaceous or igneous, the
clay mineral fraction may be very small, but the primary mineral particles are likely
to be of clay size. However, plasticity and moisture content are very different in the
two materials, but in both cases there is likely to be a scarcity of boulders. A till origi-
nating in this way is described as lodgement till.
Material which is carried along on the surface or within the glacier will be dropped
as the ice melts, a process which is gradual. Accumulations of such material are known
as ablation tills, and are likely to have a much higher proportion of boulders than lodge-
ment tills. The boulders and gravel sized fractions are angular, and it is common to
find clasts of rock which must have been transported long distances. All tills are vari-
able in their nature and consequently in their properties. In general they consist of an
assortment of rock debris ranging in size from rock flour to boulders, but all sizes are
not usually present. Gap grading is usual.
Glacial debris may be transported by meltwater and thereby become sorted and
stratified; these are fluvio-glacial deposits. Many such deposits consist of gravel and
sand and these frequently have low relative densities. Such pockets of low density are
difficult to locate, and the problem is usually anticipated and dealt with by assuming
their presence and using compaction equipment before construction begins. Coarse
grained fluvio-glacial deposits are often important sources for concrete aggregate.
Of the great variety of fluvio-glacial deposits, varved clays are perhaps the most
difficult, from a geotechnical point of view. These are deposited in areas away from
54 CHAPTER 2 · Geological Materials
the glacier front, in quiet water conditions but where the sediment is contributed on
an annual basis. Fine material reaches the depositional area in late winter and early
spring, when the meltwater current is slow: in late spring and summer the faster cur-
rent transports larger sized material, so that in a complete year a varve consists of clay
sized particles giving way to silt sized. This variation in particle size produces varia-
tion in material properties. Thus, a range of liquid limits from 30 to 80, and plastic
limits from 15 to 30, has been reported from a Canadian varved clay, which also has a
sensitivity of about 4.
Organic Soils
Organic matter in the form of partly decomposed vegetable or animal remains, even
when present in very small amounts, may significantly affect the physical and chemi-
cal properties of soil. Small amounts of colloidal organic matter in a clay, for instance,
will significantly increase both liquid and plastic limit and increase compressibility.
The presence of organic matter inhibits the setting of cement.
Peat is an accumulation of partially decomposed vegetable material. Complete de-
composition is prevented if the vegetation accumulates in water-logged anaerobic
conditions, where a series of complex biochemical and chemical changes may in-
teract to produce humus and thereafter peat. There are many varieties of peat de-
pending upon the nature of the vegetation which contributed and the details of the
conditions and reactions. However, two main varieties may be distinguished for
geotechnical purposes – the fibrous, mainly woody, peat, and the amorphous, granu-
lar variety. The difference may be summarised in the table of some geotechnical prop-
erties (Table 2.11).
Peats formed in early post-glacial times may occur at depth, buried beneath more
recent sediments. Frequently, therefore, the geotechnical problems concern the bear-
ing capacity and consolidation characteristics of the material. For peat, these are dif-
ficult to define. Calculations of settlement are difficult because peat does not conform
to normal consolidation theory. Amorphous granular peat behaves in a similar man-
ner to clay, but fibrous peat has rather different consolidation characteristics because
of the variation in size of the fibrous material and consequently the size of the voids
between the fibres.
Where possible, peat is usually removed and replaced before construction. Alter-
natively, piles may be used to take foundation loads below the peat. If sufficient time
is available, the peat may be pre-consolidated by ‘surcharging’; i.e. by loading before
Table 2.11. Some geotechnical properties of peat
2.11 · Range of Values for Material Properties 55
the foundation is constructed. With sufficient load, peat may compress to 25% of its
original volume.
2.11.2
Rocks
The range of strengths for rocks is much greater than for soils. Table 2.12 gives a
general range of values for common groups of rocks. Geological names for rocks are
given to indicate genesis or mineral content but may have no direct link with engi-
neering properties. Thus ‘sandstone’ is a stone composed of sand grains – if there is
little cementation and compaction of the grains the sandstone may be very weak. If
the grains are densely packed and the cementing mineral is strong (such as quartz)
and there are few pore spaces, the sandstone would be extremely strong. A further com-
plication in rocks is that all rocks near the surface are weathered, that is, they have
lost some strength as the result of decay of the minerals of which the rock is
composed. Thus fresh granite is stronger than a highly weathered granite. Table 3.6'
in Chap. 3 shows how the material properties of granite and dolerite vary with weath-
ering.
Correlations between Rock Properties
There are rough relationships between the various rock properties that are commonly
measured. Thus higher strength rocks tend to have larger moduli values and sonic
velocities while more porous and less dense rocks tend to be weaker. These relation-
ships are vague because of the varied mineralogy of the rocks cited but become clearer
if almost monomineralic rocks are examined. Swart (1987) conducted a series of tests
on limestones; the rocks tested, briefly described in Table 2.13, were all limestones in
the petrological sense.
The results of tests on oven dried samples of these rocks are portrayed in Figs. 2.10
to 2.13. The plots are linked by bulk density on the horizontal axis. Figure 2.10 shows
Table 2.12. General range of strengths for common rock types (based on the experience of the author)

density vs. unconfined compressive strength and it can readily be seen that strength
increases with density, reaching a maximum as rock density approaches that of
calcite. However, if the clastic limestones are separated from the clastic/crystalline
and the crystalline, the plot can be presented as two curves, A and B. The clastic rocks
are largely homogeneous and fall on a smooth curve (A). However, the remainder
have been visually assessed to be variously inhomogeneous, containing textural
discontinuities (from, for example, recrystallised fossils) representing potential flaws
which, when stressed, may bring the sample to failure. The straight line B indicates
the range of strengths of the inhomogeneous limestones suggesting that the chance
inclusion and location of textural flaws is the strength determining factor. On this

evidence it would seem unlikely that any rock classification can be based accurately
on compressive strength.
Figure 2.11 shows average tangent modulus vs. density; and here almost all the
rock types now fit reasonably on a smooth curve, suggesting that for classifica-
tion purposes elasticity is to be preferred to strength. Figure 2.12 depicts porosity
vs. density and sonic velocity vs. density. The relationship between porosity and
58 CHAPTER 2 · Geological Materials

density is striking while it can be seen clearly that as rock density approaches that
of calcite so does rock velocity approach that of calcite. Figure 2.13 combines
strength, porosity and velocity plotted against density showing how, for these par-
ticular rocks, each of these properties might be used as an approximate guide to
strength.

The Choice of Test for Rocks
While the results of just about all forms of soil testing are used in some form of calcu-
lation, the results of some forms of rock testing are seldom so used. Much testing is
undertaken simply to gauge the quality of rock material and the investigator must ask
60 CHAPTER 2 · Geological Materials
Fig. 2.13. Limestones – correlations with strength (see text)
if the task at hand requires the application of expensive testing or whether a simple
quality test, such as hitting the rock with a hammer, would be sufficient to the pur-
pose. However, if such tests are done, they must be well done, to standards. Another
difficulty is the choice and availability of material for testing. In examining and test-
ing cores the concern is to identify those weak rocks which could become overstressed
by some engineering process. Unfortunately weak layers are those least likely to pro-
duce cores sufficiently intact to give test specimens of appropriate dimensions for ac-

curate testing. Accordingly it may well be wiser to place emphasis on those index tests
which may be performed on small test specimens, such as the Equotip test (Chap. 3)
and the Block Punch test. Such tests could be undertaken in large numbers to gain a
better appreciation of rock material variability.

Geological Masses
3.1
Mass Fabric
The word ‘mass’ is already defined in Chap. 1 as ‘the volume of ground that will be in-
fluenced by or will influence the engineering work’. All rock and many soil masses have
discontinuities and their presence in the rock or soil mass is of the utmost importance
to all engineering works in rock or soil. Much research has been undertaken into the
characteristics and behaviour of discontinuities. Whole conferences, such as that on
‘Rock Joints’ held in 1990 (Barton and Stephenson 1990) have examined the subject in
great detail. However, there is a major gap between acquiring such knowledge by re-
search and the application of that knowledge to practice. The problem is that the in-
vestigator must forecast the character of the discontinuities in the mass, and thence their
likely behaviour, from the evidence available from outcrops or boreholes. Adequate data
is seldom available.
3.1.1
Discontinuities
The properties of discontinuities of greatest importance to a volume of ground are: shear
strength, influencing, for example, the stability of slopes, underground excavations, and
foundations, and stiffness, influencing the deformation and permeability of the ground.
Types of Discontinuities
Discontinuities must be classified in relation to their type. Two basic types of discon-
tinuities may be distinguished. (1) Integral discontinuities – which are discontinuities
that have yet to be opened by movement or weathering; they have tensile strength and,
hence, a true cohesion. Intact bedding planes, foliation planes, and strongly cemented
joints are integral discontinuities. (2) Mechanical discontinuities – discontinuities
which have been opened as a response to stress or weathering; they have little or no
tensile strength but do generate shear strength. They may be divided into:
(cid:1) Bedding, schistosity or foliation planes – these are formed by changes of material or
mineral arrangement in the rock.
(cid:1) Joints – which result from strains of tectonic or diagenetic origin and often fall into
well-defined sets whose members are oriented essentially parallel to each other.
64 CHAPTER 3 · Geological Masses
(cid:1) Fractures – which result from strain due to man-made stresses (blasting etc.) or
geomorphological strains (land sliding, creep etc.). They do not necessarily fall into
well-defined sets.
(cid:1) Faults and shears – which result from tectonic, geomorphological and man-made
strains, with shear movement on either side of a shear surface.
Bedding, schistosity and foliation planes, joints and fractures are normally a regu-
lar occurring feature in the mass at approximately regular distances, with similar ori-
entation, and with more or less similar characteristics (Fig. 3.1). These are normally
grouped in a “set” or family, e.g. bedding plane family and joint set, etc. Both faults
and shears may fall into well-defined sets but may occur on a scale greater than that
of most engineering works.
3.1.2
Shear Strength
The main concern regarding discontinuities in engineering geology is their resistance
to shear stress. This is described by Coulomb’s law, which is:
τ=c+σtanϕ (3.1)
n
where τ=shear strength (Nm–2), c=cohesion (Nm–2), σ =normal stress on the slid-
n
ing plane, and ϕ=angle of sliding resistance.
The cohesion may be caused by ‘true cohesion’, e.g. there is tensile strength between
the two discontinuity surfaces, or may be ‘apparent cohesion’ caused by irregularities

along the discontinuity surfaces. The surfaces of mechanical discontinuities may be
smooth and planar or exhibit varying degrees of roughness. For a particular rock the
greater the roughness of the surface the greater the resistance of the discontinuity to
shearing. If normal stresses are relatively low then shear movement along a rough
surfaced discontinuity must be accompanied by vertical dilation (Fig. 3.2). Patton
(1966) analysed the situation by proposing that the angle of shearing resistance of a
surface containing asperities inclined at angle i, is φ, the basic friction angle, plus i,
b
so that the shear strength of the discontinuity with asperities is:
τ=σ tan(φ+i) (3.2)
n b
One way to determine φ is to use a shearbox test in which vertical and horizontal
b
displacements are measured. dv/dh=tani and with Eq. 3.2, φ can be determined. The
b
φ has been measured in the laboratory by many researchers to give values ranging
b
from about 25° to 35°, the lower values generally pertaining to sedimentary rocks and
the higher to igneous rocks. If φ+i=90° sliding is not possible and breaking of the
b
asperities has to occur before shear displacement is possible. The asperities fail also if
normal and shear stresses are high relative to the strength of the asperities. Asperity
failure of a discontinuity will give an ‘apparent cohesion’ (Fig. 3.3). The residual angle
of friction, φ is the angle of friction obtained after a discontinuity has been displaced.
r
φ may equal φ, however it may not if asperities have broken, because rolling particles
r b
of debris influence the measured friction in a displaced discontinuity and the mate-
rial remaining on the discontinuity wall after breaking of the asperities may also be
of better quality, as it is probably less weathered than the outside of the asperities.
Scale of Roughness and Anisotropy
Roughness may be seen on different scales. Various authors have described roughness
scales and descriptions for roughness (Fig.3.4) show the relations as suggested by Hack
(1998). Up to mm scale the roughness is normally formed by grains or crystals in the
rock, as, say, might be found in shrinkage joints in granite. On the 0.01 to 1 m scale, rough-
ness is normally due to depositional features in sedimentary rock or foliation undula-
tions in metamorphic rock. At greater scales discontinuity surface undulations may

whether such dip variations may be considered as large scale roughness or to mark
domain limits for geotechnical units. It must be remembered that profiles are two-
dimensional while roughness is a three dimensional property. On the scale of grain
size, this may not be important except in the case of the lineation features known as
slickensides (Fig. 3.5); in the direction of lineation these are smooth but, normal to it,
they are rough. At larger scales features such as ripple marks may be similarly dis-
tinctly anisotropic.

Fitting versus Non-Fitting Roughness
Figure 3.2 shows a regular saw tooth profile as roughness profile. In reality, roughness
profiles of discontinuities are not so regular and are three-dimensional. In general,
only one perfect matching fit exists between the walls of the discontinuities. If the
walls are displaced relative to each other, the fit will become less. If the displace-
ment is large enough the roughness profiles become completely non-fitting. The ef-
fect on shear strength is that the contribution of the roughness angle i gradually
diminishes with larger displacement. The effect has been described by Rengers; the
so-called ‘Rengers envelop’ (Fig. 3.6). This effect makes it very important that the de-
scription of a discontinuity includes whether the discontinuity walls are fitting or dis-
placed. In the later case an estimate should be given as to how much the i-angle has
been reduced.
Discontinuity Wall Strength
A full evaluation of discontinuity shear strength requires not only assessment of rough-
ness but also of wall strength. Accordingly, it is necessary to measure wall rock strength.
This is almost impossible by conventional laboratory testing because of the extremely
small size of the samples but recourse may be had to impact testers applied to the dis-
continuity surface. The Schmidt hammer gives too strong a blow to be of use (for the
N-value reflects both near surface and deeper rock properties) but the Equotip tester
(Verwaal and Mulder 1993) gives a much lighter blow which rebound reflects rock
properties at shallow depth. Its use to assess wall strength has been described by Hack
et al. (1993) (Fig.3.7). If it is necessary to measure wall strength, it also follows that
for some rocks that are particularly susceptible to weathering, estimates should be
made of the rate of strength reduction by weathering of the discontinuities in any new
construction.
Aperture and Discontinuity Infill
Openness of discontinuities in outcrops may have arisen from slope relaxation, near
surface movement or plant root wedging and thus (except perhaps in the case of solu-
tion cavities in limestone) may in no way reflect internal conditions. If discontinuities
are open, they may be either wholly or partially filled by material from either weath-

ering in situ or from outside. Thus bedding planes opened by weathering may be filled with
clay or limestone solution cavities filled by washed in debris. Such infilling will clearly af-
fect the shear strength of the discontinuity. If the infill is weak, the discontinuity shear strength
may be less than that of the discontinuity with walls in contact. If the infill results from
mineralisation as, for example, quartz or calcite, the infill may be stronger than, and closely
bonded to, the rock; the discontinuity may then be described as ‘healed’. Table 3.1 (BS EN
ISO 14689-1) gives descriptive terms for discontinuities that have a continuous aper-
ture or an infill of continuous thickness in all directions. However, discontinuities often
do not have a continuous aperture or infill thickness. For such discontinuities, Table 3.1
looses its merits and other description criteria should be used, such as, descriptions based
on the ratio of volume enclosed by the discontinuity to the total rock mass volume.
Field Estimate of Discontinuity Friction Angle
Determining the shear strength of a discontinuity is one of the most difficult tasks
while it is probably the most important property to measure. A simple and often ad-
3.1 · Mass Fabric 69

ogy for aperture
equate assessment can be made with the tilt test. Two pieces of rock including the dis-
continuity are tilted while the angle of the discontinuity with the horizontal is mea-
sured (Fig. 3.8) with, for example, the inclinometer included in a geological compass.
The angle measured at the moment the top block moves is the ‘tilt-angle’. If no infill is
present and the two blocks had fitting discontinuity surfaces, the tilt angle equals the
small-scale roughness angle plus the angle of friction of the surface material. If the
discontinuity roughness is completely non-fitting, the tilt-angle equals the mate-
rial friction only. Undisturbed infill material will seldom be present in this test,
but if it is, the tilt-angle includes the influence of the undisturbed infill. If it is not
possible to obtain a sample with undisturbed infill material, it is sometimes pos-
sible to scrape infill material from another still in situ discontinuity and place this
between the blocks of the tilt test sample. The thickness of the so-formed infill
layer should be the same as in situ. The measured tilt-angle is then including the
influence of remoulded infill material. Cohesion is not measured in the tilt test sepa-
rately. If present, either real or apparent, it will be included in the tilt-angle. Steps on
discontinuity planes causing hanging of the blocks, for example, result in a very high
tilt-angle (which may be up to 90°). Whether this is realistic for the friction of the in
situ discontinuity has to be judged on the strength of the cohesion or asperities in
relation to the stresses in the in situ rock mass. Stresses in the rock mass will gen-
erally be far higher than those used during the tilt test and may cause either shearing
of real cohesion or shearing of asperities along the in situ discontinuity. Clearly, the
tilt-angle is only representative for small-scale roughness and low normal stresses as
tilting meter-scale rock blocks is normally not possible for the average engineering
geologist!
A more sophisticated methodology is to use classification systems to estimate fric-
tion or shear strength along a discontinuity. An example is the relation given in Eq. 3.3
(Barton 1971):
(3.3)
70 CHAPTER 3 · Geological Masses
Fig. 3.8. Tilt test
JRC is the joint roughness coefficient (a number, low for smooth planar surfaces
rising with increasing roughness, estimated by visual comparison of the discontinu-
ity surface to standard roughness graphs), JCS is the joint wall condition strength, σ
n
is the normal stress on the discontinuity, and φ is the residual friction angle. If no
r
other test is available, it is possible to use the tilt-angle of a non-fitting discontinuity
without infill material as residual friction angle.
Another example of a classification system for estimating discontinuity shear
strength is the ‘sliding criterion’. Based on back analyses of slope stability a sliding
criterion was developed to easily estimate the shear strength of a discontinuity (Hack
and Price 1995; Hack et al. 2002). The discontinuity is characterised following Table 3.2.
The roughness is characterised by visually estimating large (Fig. 3.9) and small-scale
(Fig. 3.10) roughness by comparing to standard profiles and by establishing tactile
roughness, infill material, and presence of karst. The different factors for the different
characteristics are multiplied and divided by an empirically established factor. This
results in the so-called ‘sliding angle’:
(3.4)
The ‘sliding angle’ is comparable to the tilt test idea but on a larger scale. The slid-
ing angle gives the maximum angle under which a block on a slope is stable. The ‘slid-
ing criterion’ has been developed on slopes between 2 and 25 m high. The ‘sliding cri-
terion’ applies for stresses that would occur in such slopes, hence, in the order of maxi-
mum 0.6 MPa.

Discontinuities may be persistent for long distances, for example, bedding planes, they
may be persistent for a certain length and end in intact rock, or they may abut against
other discontinuities. The shear strength along the discontinuity is dependent on the
persistence. Intact rock has to be broken before displacement can take place if the dis-
continuity ends in intact rock. Boundary blocks have to move before abutting
discontinuities can be displaced. If possible, persistence (sometimes called continu-
ity) of discontinuities should be measured but opportunities to take such measure-

acterisation for ‘sliding criterion’
(after Hack and Price 1995)
ments are limited to outcrops. Persistence cannot be measured from cores. Persistence
is usually quoted as a simple one-dimensional measurement; the terminology for its
description is given in Table 3.3. However, in reality persistence exists in two dimensions.
Thus in Fig. 3.11a joint y seen in an outcrop perpendicular to the direction of strike may
have but small persistence across a bed (e.g. abutting) while, seen on the bedding plane,
it may have long persistence in the direction of strike. In Fig. 3.11b, joint y has limited
persistence in the direction of strike. The difference in two-dimensional persistence
between joints y in Fig. 3.11a and b could have great significance in slope stability. Sand-
stone blocks could part along y and slide down slope over the shale in Fig. 3.11a, but in
Fig. 3.11b parting and down slope block sliding would be inhibited by the limited persis-
tence of joint y. It is suggested that persistence in banked (see Fig. 3.12) and bedded
rocks be recorded as a proportion of bank thickness. Thus, for example, in Fig. 3.11a the
persistence of y could be given as >20 t in strike direction, where t is bank thickness,
and in Fig. 3.11b the persistence of y could be given as ¼ to 1½ t in strike direction.

Orientation
The importance of discontinuities in any particular project depends partly on
their orientation relative to directions of imposed stresses. The geologist records
the orientation of discontinuities (which may be geological surfaces such as bed-
ding planes giving an indication of geological structure) using a geological com-
pass/clinometer usually placed on the surface being measured at some readily ac-
cessible outcrop. In the much more detailed surface mapping required for engi-
neering geological purposes dip and strike measurements of discontinuities have

to be taken regardless of whether they are easy to reach or not. For work in tun-
nels, the compass/clinometer must have built-in illumination. Clinometers should
have the capacity to sight-in the inclination of a discontinuity that cannot be
reached for a contact measurement, say, for example, in a tunnel roof. Discontinu-
ity orientation may also be measured from terrestrial stereo-photographs or la-
ser scans (Slob et al. 2002).
There are various ways of expressing orientation. For engineering geological pur-
poses, the best way is to record fully dip and strike data, leaving no possibility for
misinterpretation of the record. Check the method you propose to use with another
person – do they understand it!

3.1.5
Spacing
It is quite clear that in describing a ground mass mention must be made of the spac-
ing of discontinuities, e.g. the perpendicular distance between two discontinuities
from the same set. This spacing is relevant to problems of slope stability, tunnel
stability, excavation, groundwater flow and foundation bearing capacity. The termi-
nology, which is standard for the description of discontinuity spacing, is given in
Table 3.4. However, the use of this terminology does pose some problems when ap-
plied to bedded rocks. Assume the rock slope illustrated in Fig. 3.12 is in sandstone.
The upper part of the slope is old, the lower part newly excavated, but because some,
mostly higher, bedding planes have been opened by weathering and some assem-
blies of beds are separated by thin shaley units, the spacing of the bedding planes
does not reflect the thickness of the geotechnical layers which would be of significance

sions and description (after BS

in, say, slope stability. To overcome this problem a further descriptive terms is
needed. The author suggests the use of the term ‘bank’ to indicate a layer of geotech-
nical significance. Thus the sandstone in zone A in the slope would be described as
‘thinly banked thinly bedded’ while that in zone B would be ‘thickly banked me-
dium bedded’.
The shape and size of rock blocks depends upon the spacing of the discontinuities
bounding them. The terminology proposed by British Standards (1999) is given in
Table 3.5 and is designed to indicate the size of rock blocks that may come out of a
quarry or be encountered in a tunnel.
76 CHAPTER 3 · Geological Masses
3.2
Weathering
Most civil engineering works occur close to the surface and the process of ‘weather-
ing’ has affected most groundmasses at shallow depth. Because of this, weathering
of both engineering soils and rocks is one of the most important problems with
which the engineering geologist has to contend. Weathering implies decay and change
in state from an original condition to a new condition as a result of external pro-
cesses. A review of weathering processes has been given by various authors (Anon 1995;
Price 1995).
A most obvious sign of weathering is brown staining by the oxidation of iron bear-
ing minerals. While solution is an agency involved in most forms of chemical weath-
ering, it is most prominent in limestones and rocks containing halite and gypsum.
In limestones, such as chalk and calcarenites, near vertical solution pipes may form
extending from the limestone/overburden surface to depths of perhaps as much as
40 m. These are usually wholly but sometimes partially infilled by overburden depos-
its which have flowed or been washed in from above. Crystalline limestones are of-
ten strong enough to support the development of underground cavern systems
through which rivers may flow. The limestones closely adjacent to such systems
may be entirely unaffected by the solution weathering and be as strong as the fresh
material.
Weathering takes place in all environments but is most intense in hot, wet climates
where weathering may be expected to extend to great depths. While weathering may
reach great depths in limestones, and rocks containing halite and gypsum, it is slow to
do so and the style of weathering may change if climatic conditions change. In the
northern hemisphere, where large areas have been subjected to phases of glaciation
with intervening warmer periods the weathered nature of the groundmass as pres-
ently seen may reflect these changes. Thus, in the most recently glaciated areas all
weathered materials may have been carved away by ice and almost fresh rock exposed.
Beyond the boundaries of glaciation, weathering may reflect periglacial conditions
(Higginbottom and Fookes 1971). It is generally thought that, at the end of the last
glaciation, sea level rose by about 100 m. This implies that in seas less than 100 m deep,
sea bed materials have been exposed to sub-aerial weathering for a substantial period
of time and their properties may reflect this. Indeed, if at any time in geological his-
tory, any material has been exposed above surface, it would have been subject to weath-
ering. Thus in Western Australia, some of the laterites exposed (and perhaps covered
by more recent deposits) are thought to be of Tertiary age (Geological Survey of West-
ern Australia 1974).
3.2.1
Influence of Weathering on Rock Mass Properties
Weathering weakens rocks. Table 3.6 shows how rock material and rock mass proper-
ties can change with weathering. The table in which the weathering is given by
grades (I=fresh to VI=residual soil) shows the considerable difference in mate-
rial properties that are a consequence of weathering. An ordinary geological map show-
ing the granodiorite or the dolerite in the table would not give any indication of the

weathered condition of the rock, yet clearly this has great influence on the likely engi-
neering behaviour of that rock material and mass. Because of this, it is customary to
describe the weathered condition of the rock in all engineering geological descrip-
tions of material or mass.
3.2.2
Susceptibility to Weathering
The lifetimes of most structures for civil engineering and infrastructure are in the order
of 50 to 100 years. To guarantee the safe and sound design for the whole lifetime it is
important to know what the geotechnical properties of the soil or rock mass are go-
ing to be at the end of this time span, i.e.the susceptibility to weathering of the soil or
rock mass. If, for example, a slope is excavated in a sandstone in which the cement
between the grains consists of gypsum it can be expected that in a moderate climate
the gypsum will dissolve and the sandstone rock mass changes into a soil mass of loose
sand grains within a few years. A slope made in fresh granite is not expected to un-
dergo any major changes within 100 years in a moderate climate. The influence of
weathering on intact rock used as building or grave-stones has been studied and
also rates for weathering have been established. For most soils and rocks it is also
reasonably well known how they deteriorate over long (geological) periods. However,
for 50 to 100 year time spans very little is known. Research has been done to the weath-
ering rates in underground excavations and its influence on rock mass classification
ratings (Laubscher 1990) (see Chap. 4). For the extremes given in the slope example
above, it is generally not difficult to make an estimate of the changes of properties
due to weathering. For many other soil or rock masses, for which it is not so clear,
the engineer has to estimate the susceptibility to weathering based on other expo-
sures of known excavation date. If these do not exist, engineering judgement has to
be used.
3.2.3
Standard Weathering Description Systems
Weathering can be described following a relatively simple scheme, such as in Table 3.7
which is compiled from recommendations given in BS 5930 (1981) and the report of
the Engineering Group Working Party on Core Logging (Anon 1970), or from more
elaborate schemes of which BS5930 (1999) is an example (Fig. 3.13, Table 3.8). While
the simple scheme is easy to use, it often does not fit a particular state of weathering
for a particular material in a particular environment. The more elaborate schemes have
more flexibility to fit all sorts of materials and environments, but have the potential
of being over complex and not understood.
The factors entering into the description of weathering are the condition of the
discontinuities (joints, bedding planes, foliations etc.) and the condition of the mate-
rial between the discontinuities. Weathering begins on the discontinuities that trans-
mit water. Increasing weathering affects more and more discontinuities and eventu-
ally starts to affect the rock material. Usually rock mass weathering is assessed from a
number of boreholes, and natural or artificial outcrops. Boundaries between weath-
ering grades can never be more than approximate.

3.2.4
Weathering Description and Zonation
Weathering is a gradational feature and to deal with such features the usual approach
is to impose boundary conditions within them so that they are divided into various
grades defined by a range of characteristics. In reviewing the applicability of the grades
of weathering proposed in the various systems mentioned above it is well to remem-
ber the purpose of describing weathering i.e. is to assess its significance with regard
to engineering projects to be conducted in or upon the weathered rock mass. This sig-
nificance depends upon two factors, first the change in engineering properties of the
rock material and second, the volumetric regularity or irregularity of this reduction
within the rock mass. Regarding the second, the writer distinguishes four basic types
of mass weathering. These are:
1. Uniform weathering. A gradual decrease of weathering grade and intensity with
depth, in thick strata of homogeneous lithology.
2. Complex weathering. An irregular weathering profile in layered lithologies that have
different susceptibilities to weathering. It may mean that more weathered strata lie
under less weathered strata, particularly if the strata dip from surface outcrop.
3. Corestone weathering. In many, mostly coarser grained, igneous rocks rounded
‘corestones’ of almost fresh rock may be surrounded by very decomposed highly fri-
able material, similar to a compact sand. The corestones become larger with depth.
4. Solution weathering. Carbonate and most salt rocks weather by dissolution. Joints
and bedding planes become open and underground caverns may develop. In strong
crystalline limestones, karstic conditions may result. In the weaker calcarenites,

82 CHAPTER 3 · Geological Masses
calcisiltites and calcilutites (chalk), solution pipes, often infilled with materials from
above, may have penetrated deeply into the strata.
While a complete volume of rock mass might be described using the terms given
above within that mass the weathered nature must be described in greater detail in
order to more closely target an engineering problem. This is perhaps best done with
regard to the engineering significance of the mass weathering observed. The follow-
ing terms are proposed:
i Effectively unweathered. The weathering of the rock mass is such that any engineer-
ing work may be constructed on or in it without regard to the weathered condition
as found.
ii Significantly weathered. The weathering of the rock mass is such that some regard
must be taken of the weathered condition of the rock mass in the design and con-
struction of some particular engineering works. For example, weathering of
discontinuities could imply an impairment of shear strength if the work involves the
construction of rock slopes, but such weathering would have less effect on the de-
sign of foundations on the rock mass.
iii Severely weathered. The weathering of the rock mass is such that the weathered con-
dition of the mass dominates the design and construction of any engineering work
to be constructed on or in it. This implies both weathering of discontinuities and
materials.
iv Residual soil. Sufficient of the rock material is decayed to the geotechnical condi-
tion of a soil to make the mass behave as a mass of soil. It may be important, because
of their influence on, for example, slope stability, to distinguish between those re-
sidual soils that are structureless and those that have relict discontinuities.
The boundary between (iii) and (iv) is difficult to establish. A rock mass in condi-
tion (iv) may contain relict rock blocks which, if in continuous contact, may present
the engineering behaviour of a rather weak rock mass. If the relict blocks are not in
contact, the total mass may behave as an engineering soil. If the volume of soil mate-
rial exceeds about 50% of the mass then the behaviour of the total mass should be
that of a soil and be categorised as residual soil (iv); if the volume of soil is less than
about 30% then behaviour should be that of a severely weathered rock mass (iii). It
will be difficult to estimate such percentages in this transition zone between soil and
rock mechanics and estimates are most likely to be subjective.
The terms given above could be used to describe zones of weathering within a rock
mass. Such zones might be observed in outcrop and boundaries evaluated. The au-
thor has suggested a ratings system to aid establishing such boundaries (Price 1993).
It also provides a numerical estimate of weathering that may form part of a rock mass
classification system and has been so used by Laughton and Nelson (1996) in consid-
ering the rock mass parameters that are necessary to predict tunnel boring machine
performance. The data required to zone a rock mass into categories (i) to (iv) may come
from natural or artificial surface outcrops but is derived most commonly from bore-
holes. Thus, in core descriptions note must be made of the weathered condition of
discontinuities and the extent of decay of rock materials.
3.3 · Ground Mass Description 83
In rock mechanics the condition of discontinuities is of major importance and it
would seem logical to describe discontinuity weathering to provide a link to assess-
ments of discontinuity strength. In both integral and mechanical discontinuities, three
main conditions may be considered to exist. These are:
(cid:1) fresh: no sign of weathering
(cid:1) surface stained: no or little penetration of weathering into the wall rock (so that the
discontinuity asperities have the strength of fresh rock)
(cid:1) surface weathered: weathering penetrates to a depth greater than the roughness or
undulations of the discontinuity surface (so that the discontinuity asperities have a
strength less than that of fresh rock)
In the case of rock materials similar simple terms may be applied, namely:
(cid:1) fresh: no sign of weathering
(cid:1) stained: the material is weathered but without obvious loss in strength
(cid:1) decayed: deeply stained and with obvious loss of strength, perhaps friable
In the case of solution weathering an additional term, “absent by solution”, might
be applied.
Achieving a weathering zonation of a rock mass investigated largely by boreholes
is greatly aided if the style of weathering in outcrops of similar rock can be studied,
even if these are not located close to the site. This may help the investigator appreci-
ate the relationship of the linear data given by boreholes to the volumetric reality of
the rock mass.
3.3
Ground Mass Description
A volume of ground may have some exposure that can be studied but in most cases it
has to be investigated and described with the aid of core recovered from boreholes
drilled for that purpose. The borehole core provides a description of the vertical pro-
file but at some stage a general description of the volume is needed.
3.3.1
General Mass Description
Most ground masses on or in which engineering works are to be performed can be
considered composed of a series of geotechnical units each distinguished by particu-
lar mass properties. The range of properties defining a unit is assigned by the investi-
gator, commonly with regard to the particular type of engineering work to be per-
formed. Thus a ground mass which is to be excavated to form a large road cutting might
be divided into units relative to ease of excavation, to reuse of the excavated materials
as embankment fill, or with regard to slope stability. The units related to one engi-
neering process are not necessarily the same as those for another process for their
boundaries would be defined by different parameters.
84 CHAPTER 3 · Geological Masses
Whatever the units, the description of the mass must include descriptions of the
units, their boundaries, their discontinuities, their water content and the level of
groundwater within them. A common way of obtaining this information is to drill holes
into the ground and describe the samples (cores) recovered from them. The process
of describing such cores is known as core logging.
3.3.2
Core Logging
Poor or inappropriate core logging can lead to major civil engineering claims. Accord-
ingly, accurate core logging is one of the most important activities for the engineer-
ing geologist. Cores taken as part of a site investigation for an engineering project
should be logged by an engineering geologist rather than a geologist for the style, con-
tent and emphasis of the descriptions will depend on the recognition of the impor-
tance of the geological factors revealed in the cores to the particular engineering
project. If the logging of a specific geology feature, such as structural geology, fossil
content, etc., is required, a geologist specialised in the required feature should rather
do this additionally.
Basic Requirements for Good Core Logging
The contractor and consultant must ensure that the cores are placed in good, well-la-
belled core boxes and are stored so that their condition as recovered from the bore-
hole is maintained. They should not be allowed to dry out, be eroded by rain, frozen,
etc. A well-lit large table in a clean, dry, covered store should be provided as a logging
area. Help should be available to move core boxes.
The Process of Core Logging
Ideally, all the cores should be logged in one exercise and the logger must be fully aware
of and understand the nature of the engineering work so that the log gives the infor-
mation necessary for the design of that work. Cores may be logged as they come out
of the borehole for their description may influence the further development of the
investigation but this provisional log should not be the final log.
For the final log the logger must look at all the soils and rocks and decide provi-
sionally what they should be called and in what detail they should be described. A
published system of description should be used and its selection justified. The way in
which the cores are described will depend upon the geology, the engineering work,
and the nature of the problem that the geology poses for that work. Photos of the core
boxes against a scale should be made for later reference.
The cores should be sorted out so that they fit together as well as possible to allow
Total Core Recovery (TCR) and, if required, Solid Core Recovery (SCR) and Rock Qual-
ity Designation (RQD) to be measured. TCR is the length of core recovered divided by
the length of hole drilled (the core run) expressed as a percentage (Fig. 3.14). SCR is
the total length of solid core cylinders as a percentage of the core run. Care has to be
taken in defining what is meant by ‘solid’ (Norbury et al. 1986). RQD is the total length
of core sticks longer than 4 inches (now commonly converted to 100 mm) expressed
3.3 · Ground Mass Description 85
Fig. 3.14. Measurements that
may be made on rock cores
as a percentage of the core run. According to Deere (1968) “‘The Rock Quality Desig-
nation’ (RQD) is based on a modified core recovery procedure which, in turn, is based
indirectly on the number of fractures and the amount of softening or alteration in the
rock mass as observed in the rock cores in a borehole.” Fractures induced by handling
or the drilling process should not be counted (the pieces broken by such fractures
should be fitted together and their total length measured) and the pieces counted
should be ‘hard and sound’. If all the sticks of core measured are less than 100 mm
long, RQD is zero and if there are no breaks in the core RQD is 100%. This raises the
possibility that if all sticks were 99 mm long, RQD would be 0% and if all were 101 mm
long RQD would be 100%. Clearly measuring mechanical discontinuity spacing against
a fixed baseline has some disadvantages. Some workers have measured RQD against
several baseline lengths to give a guide to rock block size; Edmond and Graham (1977)
did this to assess block size in a rock mass through which a tunnel was to be driven.
Some rock materials are composed of thinly interlaminated sandy and clayey bands.
They may come out of the core barrel as solid sticks of rock but on drying out sepa-
rate into thin discs, splitting along the clayey layers. RQD measured on the dried out
cores would be very much lower than on those just recovered from the borehole. The
logger is then faced with the difficult choice between including or ignoring the dry-
ing-out breaks. Inclusion gives a quality assessment of the rock material; exclusion
gives an RQD related only to genetically, tectonically, or geomorphologically induced
discontinuities. Such discing may also be a consequence of stress relief. Whether or
86 CHAPTER 3 · Geological Masses
not included in RQD measurements such discing would merit description and discus-
sion in the report.
The uncertainties concerning the measurement and meaning of RQD suggest that
RQD should be abandoned and the author does not recommend its use. It has, how-
ever, been incorporated in some Rock Mass Classification systems, and because of this
will probably continued to be measured until these systems are modified or abandoned.
The best reason to abandon RQD is to take advantage of the opportunities that com-
puter technology offers. It should be appreciated that the RQD calculated from core
applies only to the direction in which the hole from which the core is recovered, was
drilled. An alternative to RQD is to record the number of fractures per given length of
borehole. This may be done for metres depth, for each lithology or each engineering
geological unit distinguished.
Recording
The logging process falls mostly into two parts; first describing the materials and sec-
ond, describing the discontinuities. It is often a good idea to do the discontinuity mea-
surements (stick length, joint and bedding dip, etc.) first. It is better to measure the
depth and dip of every mechanical discontinuity so that thereafter any calculations
(RQD, frequency etc.) can be made. If using a rock mass classification system some-
where in the project remember to gain the data to fill in the ratings. This may involve
noting joint roughness, infilling etc., and also means that the rock mass classification
system must be chosen before beginning logging.
The process of making the discontinuity measurements gives another chance to look
at the rocks and consider the descriptions to be used. Geologically this is quite easy,
but engineering geologically rather difficult for the observer seeks to identify geological
features of significance to that particular engineering work. While it is quite easy to
become absorbed in the engineering geological and rock mechanical side of logging,
it must not be forgotten that a proper description of the geology must also be made.
This is necessary for correlation between boreholes and with surface data. In writing
the descriptions, the word order should be consistent, following a recognised system
such as that offered in BS5930 (1999). Any departures from that system should also be
consistent and the reason for them explained in the report.
Features in the cores resulting from drilling, have to be identified. Thus, ends of
core runs tend to be more broken while core springs may produce scratch marks simu-
lating bedding. These should be noted on the record. Because the core spring is situ-
ated above the cutting face of the drilling bit extraction of the core may leave a core
stub at the bottom of the borehole. If this is recovered in the next run then the core
recovery for that run could exceed 100%. If a stub is left at the bottom of the hole and
the next core run completely fills the core barrel then cores may be crushed.
Logging the strength of the rock cores by some form of simple test may be neces-
sary. This may be done using such devices as the Point Load Tester, but these break
the core and may thus reduce the amount of core available for accurate laboratory test-
ing. The author does not recommend this test. The ISRM ‘Suggested Methods’ (Brown
1981) includes a method of using the Schmidt hammer on cores in the laboratory, but
3.3 · Ground Mass Description 87
the author prefers cross diameter acoustic logging or the use of the Equotip (a kind of
mini-Schmidt hammer).
If samples are extracted then something should be put in their place (ideally a block
of wood cut to length and labelled) and noted. Core boxes should have a logging record
pinned to the inside of the lid on which the logger notes who and when the cores were
logged and also records any samples taken.
In the initial stages of logging, errors of the driller in placing the cores in the box
may be encountered. It is useful to be familiar with top and bottom criteria to identify
cores that may have been put in upside down. Before logging rock it is useful to wash
the cores and look at them wet, for wet cores show more than dry ones. In soils a little
drying often helps reveal delicate sedimentary structures such as lamination. Cores
may have to be broken to determine the rock type. If this is done note the locations of
breaks made; an indelible felt pen is useful for this. If possible, at the end of the log-
ging of a number of boreholes, all logs should be examined again to check consistency
of description.
Discontinuity Orientation
The dip of discontinuities may readily be measured on cores from a vertical borehole,
however, the direction of dip can only be measured with special, and usually expen-
sive, equipment. If the direction of dip of the dominant integral discontinuity (bed-
ding or foliation) is known, it is possible to measure the direction of dip of other
discontinuities relative to it.
Daily Logging Rate
A good core logger, giving a full engineering geological description for a complex
project, can usually manage to log about 30 m of core a day before mental indigestion
sets in. It is important to be comfortable to do the work; logging in the mud in a mos-
quito-infested swamp usually produces poor logs. It is much better to do the work in
a well-lit, air-conditioned hut, sitting in a comfortable chair with a pot of coffee at hand.
3.3.3
A Theoretical Example
Figure 3.15 is a drawing of three core boxes to illustrate some of the points made above.
The Equotip rebound values have to be converted to unconfined compressive strength
with the help of Fig. 3.7. The drawing Fig. 3.15 is two dimensional and limited in what
it shows by the constraints of the graphics programme used for its construction. De-
tails are as follows:
1. Three core boxes are illustrated containing cores obtained by rotary core drilling from
15.00 to 38.06 m depth. The upper two boxes contain 160 mm diameter core, the low-
est 120 mm diameter core. The driller has marked the beginning and end of each
core run, which are measured from the drill rods, and has also estimated the depth

then these latter depths may be inaccurate.
2. The cores have been placed in the core boxes to more-or-less fill them without break-
ing the cores more than is necessary. However, there will be some ‘fitting’ breaks and
one of the first tasks in logging is to identify them. One such break is to be found at
point ‘A’; there are others. They would not be counted as natural discontinuities for
RQD measurements etc.
3.3 · Ground Mass Description 89
3. The cores in the first box show a ‘fining upwards’ succession of rocks (conglo-
merate⇒sandstone⇒sandy mudstone⇒mudstone⇒coal). The stick at ‘B’
shows this succession inverted and has thus been placed upside down in the
box.
4. The rocks at ‘C’, just below the 18.75 m core run marker are rather broken and may
represent an over-drilled core stub, left in the hole at the end of the previous run
and disturbed at the beginning of the next run.
5. The fragment of rock at ‘D’ would not appear to be in the correct place and may come
from the bottom of the run at 22.50 m.
6. The joint at ‘E’ may be open. If, when its two surfaces are placed in contact, the thick-
ness of the core is less than the diameter drilled then the joint is open and the aper-
ture can be calculated.
7. At ‘F’, the core is very broken and at this point, the driller decided to reduce core
diameter, presumably as a result of encountering drilling difficulties. Such difficul-
ties would be recorded in the daily drilling log. The implication is thus that the breaks
in the core above and below 31.05 m are a consequence of natural phenomena and
not the drilling itself. The same remark could apply to the broken core just above
38.06 m but here it might also be the core cracking in the vicinity of the core spring
on breaking off the core to pull it to surface.
Describing Lithologies
There are clear differences between the strata above about 22.70 m, from 22.70 to about
31.00 m and below this last depth. In the case of the strata above 22.70 m there would
appear to be cyclic deposition in fining up sequences. There are various ways of de-
scribing the sequence. If the project concerns putting foundations on the rock mass it
would probably be sufficient to record the number of cycles of deposition and to in-
dicate their nature. If the rocks are likely to be exposed in a slope or tunnel wall it would
be prudent to emphasise the presence of the coaly laminae which could squeeze or
which could form planes on which sliding might take place. Alternatively, a more fac-
tual approach could be taken and the rocks closely described layer by layer with mea-
surements of depth and thickness.
At about 22.75 m a conglomerate is found composed of limestone pebbles and may
well mark an unconformity. A check on the relative ages of the limestone and overly-
ing cyclic deposits would be of value for the unconformity surface could be that of a
very irregularly eroded landscape. The limestones show fractures, perhaps solution
opened, and healed by calcite veining. The end of the core shows solution features, there
is significant core loss, and the driller may have recorded encountering cavities as the
hole was drilled.
The limestones are not all the same. They are generally pale grey but two pieces,
perhaps once joined by a calcite vein, are dark grey and show different bedding dips.
This could be a consequence of faulting. Below about 30.90 m the mudstones and sand-
stones are again encountered although lacking indications of cyclic deposition. How-
ever, while their bedding below about 32 m is regular and thin between 31 and 32 m it
becomes variable with indications of folding. This can be syn-sedimentary, but is prob-
ably faulting.
90 CHAPTER 3 · Geological Masses
Structure and Strength
Measurements of bedding dip would be taken as frequently as the dip varied. The rela-
tive orientation of joints could also be measured. Strength may be assessed by the
Equotip rebound number or some other method but indicated in the log by the terms
used in the scale of strength for rocks, e.g. moderately strong. The description of the
cores shown in Fig. 3.15 is given as in Chap. 7.

Maps
An engineering work either influences, or is influenced by, the groundmass in its vi-
cinity. The distribution of materials and discontinuities in the mass may be shown on
maps. Most investigations include the study and/or construction of a geological map.
Published maps are studied to gain an idea of site conditions before designing an in-
vestigation. Maps produced as a consequence of investigation display appropriate geo-
logical information as an aid to design and construction of the works.
4.1.1
Published Geological Maps
The majority of the earth’s surface has been mapped geologically. Often the scale of
the geological maps is rather small, perhaps only 1:1000000 but in a number of coun-
tries maps are published on scales of from 1:100000 to 1:50000 and in some cases at
scales as large as 1:10000. Geological maps are constructed to show:
(cid:1) the stratigraphic names, and thus the relative age, of the geological formations in
the area mapped,
(cid:1) the distribution of these formations within the area mapped,
(cid:1) the geological structure of the area mapped.
They may also show:
(cid:1) the lithology of the formations,
(cid:1) geomorphological features in the area, such as major landslides,
(cid:1) features resulting from the activities of man, such as mines and quarries.
Because geological maps show the stratigraphy and relative age of formations, it is
possible to deduce whether strata seen on the map are older or younger than their
neighbouring formations. If this is known, then, by looking at the pattern of outcrops
in relation to the physiography of the landscape, it is possible to gain insight into the
general structure of the geology of the area. This may enable the geologist to draw
cross-sections through areas to show the underground geology along that line of sec-
tion. This has the immediate practical engineering geological purpose of showing, for
example, the likely geology to be encountered along the line of a proposed tunnel or
trench excavation.
92 CHAPTER 4 · Maps
Often these maps seem to be of little value to the engineer and may seem to some
to be quite misleading. Many formation names incorporate lithological terms, such as
limestone or sandstone, which were given at a time when it seemed to the geologist
discovering the formation that the dominant rock was limestone or sandstone. Since
the original discovery the formation name, incorporating the lithological term, may
have been applied to strata of similar age but with a different lithology. Geologists
recognise these problems, for this is part of their professional expertise, and they un-
derstand that to read a geological map correctly one must also study the geological
memoir or guide that accompanies the map. Much of this extra information is not
readily available and may be difficult to obtain quickly. It must also be understood
that the majority of geological maps were made with the scientific aim of explaining
the geology rather than for use in engineering practice. Accordingly, the majority of
the older maps do not incorporate much, if any, detail of superficial geomorphologi-
cal features, such as landslides.
4.1.2
Published Engineering Geological Maps
In recent years, there has been considerable activity in the production of engineering
geological maps. These maps are specifically designed for engineering purposes and
give specific attention to such features as:
(cid:1) the lithology of the strata,
(cid:1) the thickness of the layers and their depth below surface,
(cid:1) the depth to the water table,
(cid:1) the location of significant geomorphological features, such as the presence of karst
features in limestone, landslides, active faults etc.,
(cid:1) hazards remaining as the result of past industry, such as abandoned mines, old quar-
ries, areas of toxic fill etc.,
(cid:1) location of construction materials.
There are so many features of interest for engineers that could go on a map that it
is almost impossible to put everything on one map. Also, depending on the nature of
the feature, it is best displayed at a particular scale. An engineer concerned with the
location of old mine workings will find that a map showing these on a scale of 1:50000
would be of little practical value although this would be a useful scale for someone
wishing to view the general hydrogeology of a region.
4.2
Geological Map Making
Before dealing with engineering geological maps it is of importance to consider the
value and problems of construction of ordinary geological maps, for often standard
geological maps form the basis of engineering geological maps. Traditional geologi-
cal mapping was (and is) undertaken by one geologist who, with the aid of an existing
topographical map (and often aerial photographs and remotely sensed imagery),
traverses the countryside to search for natural or artificial outcrops of the strata. Quite
4.2 · Geological Map Making 93
frequently mapping begins adjacent to rivers and streams and along coastlines where
outcrops exposed by erosion may be expected to be found. These outcrops are mea-
sured and described, the materials found placed in their stratigraphic position and
the location of the observation is plotted on the map. It must not be forgotten that
this location is plotted by a geologist, aided, for older maps, only by a magnetic com-
pass, on a map, which may show few features that can be recognised and can help es-
tablish the exact location. It is not surprising therefore that the mapped locations of
outcrops may be found to be somewhat erroneous if, later, their position is surveyed
accurately. Newer maps may not suffer this problem as position is determined with
modern methods as GPS (Global Positioning System), high resolution aerial photo-
graphs, etc. (see below).
4.2.1
Linking the Data
Having plotted outcrops, the geologist then has the task of linking the outcrops to-
gether to show boundaries between formations by studying the form of the landscape
in which breaks in the slope may indicate the presence, under the cover of soil and
vegetation, of harder or softer layers. Quaternary deposits may be contained within
landforms, such as terraces, drumlins, or barchans that can be recognised by their
shape. Thus, the geomorphology of the landscape is a tool with which the boundaries
of geological formations may be detected. Geologists experienced in particular areas
may also be able to look at the type of soil present and the nature of the vegetation
growing to get some idea of the underlying geology. Soil type and vegetation type
boundaries may also be geological boundaries. The actual plotting of these bound-
aries on the map is subject to the same inaccuracies as the plotting of the location of
outcrops.
Today both the plotting of outcrops and boundaries is greatly aided by the use of
aerial photographs and Global Positioning systems (GPS). Aerial photographs show
features, such as trees, bushes, irregularities in slope etc. that are not presented on
ordinary topographical maps. Geological mapping with the aid of aerial photographs
is, in general, much more accurate than mapping without, depending on the scale and
age of the photographs. Thus plotting boundaries on a 1:1250 topographical map may
not be significantly aided by 1:40000 scale aerial photographs. Moreover, it must not
be forgotten that aerial photographs help to evaluate accurately and locate the bound-
aries of features; it does not follow automatically that these boundaries reflect under-
ground geology. However, it is fair to say that the modern geological map is probably
much more accurate in terms of location of boundaries than the older map. It is thus
of some importance when reviewing geological maps, to look at the date of publica-
tion and the date of mapping. These two dates may be very different, because some
years may pass between finishing mapping and publication of the map. Maps first
prepared many, many years ago may be several times revised. Geological surveys mostly
have geologists who are responsible for the geology of particular areas who will ex-
amine any new excavations that may be made, samples taken from boreholes etc. and
when sufficient information is available will revise the map.
It is obvious that geological maps are only as good as the quality and quantity of
information used in their compilation. Often, for example in urban areas, there might
94 CHAPTER 4 · Maps
be a large amount of geological data available gathered from boreholes, wells, road
excavations, sewer excavations and so forth. In rural areas, devoid of artificial expo-
sures and perhaps with few natural outcrops, the quantity of data available may be
small. Many of the larger scale maps show locations of borings while observations on
the map (such as dips and strikes, fossil locations etc.) indicate where the outcrops
were seen. It is possible by looking for such observations to judge whether or not the
map was prepared with the help of much data or with very little. This may also be dif-
ferent on one map. Often exposures are only found along roads and rivers, but few in
the rest of the area. Particular attention should be taken if a map shows many mea-
surements along easy accessible areas such as roads and around towns despite there
being plenty of exposures at other locations more difficult to access. This may be an
indication of low quality mapping, possibly prepared by geologists with little time and
less enthusiasm (often aptly named a ‘hotel or bar-map’).
National geological surveys generally retain the original field maps from which the
published maps were prepared. Commonly the field mapping was done on a larger
scale (say 1:25000 or 1:10000) than the published map (at say, 1:250000 or 1:50000).
There may be observations on the field maps for which there was no room on the
published map. It is generally a good idea to examine the field map held by the geo-
logical survey to judge the accuracy of the published map and to see if the field map
contains any observations which did not get on to the published map. Great accuracy
is expected in engineering geological maps for exact knowledge of ground conditions
is required for engineering purposes. This degree of accuracy is seldom attained in
published geological maps. Many investigations must begin with boring and trial ex-
cavations designed to confirm and thence to improve the existing geological informa-
tion. However, engineers should not be too critical of geological surveys when they
find inaccuracies in geological maps; the accuracy of the map is only so good as the
data available to prepare it.
4.3
Understanding Geological Maps
Geological maps must be interpreted in order to understand the geological struc-
ture of an area. All geological maps show the real or interpreted position of the vari-
ous stratigraphic units below the surface. Boundaries, which have been observed, are
usually shown as solid lines, inferred, or assumed boundaries as dashed lines. It should
be noted that there is no common definition for ‘observed’ and ‘inferred’. One geolo-
gist may mark a boundary that has not been observed, but is certain in his or her opin-
ion, as ‘observed’ while another geologist may mark the same boundary as ‘inferred’.
Other symbols on the maps relate to geological structure, the most common being
those indicating the dip and strike of the strata (Fig. 4.1).
Geological surfaces that are inclined are said to dip, the angle of dip being the
maximum inclination of the surface measured, by convention, from the horizontal. The
strike of a surface is the direction of a horizontal line drawn on that surface, usually
expressed relative to north. A geological surface could be the top or bottom of a bed
of sedimentary rocks, one side or the other of an intrusive dyke, a fault or a joint; it is
two-dimensional. A geological body is bounded by geological surfaces and has thick-
ness.
4.3 · Understanding Geological Maps 95
Fig. 4.1. Dip and strike
Geological maps on larger scales are usually plotted on topographical maps which
show contour lines, roads, field boundaries, buildings and other land use features and
mostly have a grid co-ordinate network with a magnetic and true north symbol as
part of the general information.
If a map is to be interpreted for engineering purposes scales of 1:10000 or larger
are required and the map must have contours. If the geological map shows outcrops
and contour lines from which the levels of points on the outcrops can be measured
then it is possible to interpret the map to indicate the levels and positions of the lay-
ers underground. To do this the interpreter must have points of known elevation on
boundary surfaces between geological units. Just as points of elevation above mean
sea level (the datum plane) on the landscape may be interpreted to give contour lines,
points of elevation on geological surfaces may be interpreted to give strikelines. At least
three elevations are required to draw the strikelines on any dipping plane surface. If
that surface is plane and uniformly dipping, strikelines will be parallel and uniformly
spaced. In Fig.4.2 points A, B and C on a geological surface are at levels of 30 m, 10 m,
and 0 m above datum respectively. To find the dip of the plane:
96 CHAPTER 4 · Maps
i Join the points to form a triangle.
ii Measure the lengths of the lines.
iii The point at which the plane lies at elevation 20 m must lie halfway between A and B
at X and 1/3 of the distance AC from A at Y. Join X to Y to give the 20 m strikeline.
Zero, 10 and 30 m strikelines may be drawn parallel to the 20 m strikeline.
The dip of the surface can be determined by drawing a cross-section but is also
done by calculation. Thus in Fig. 4.2 the line CD is the horizontal distance between
strikelines while the height difference between strikelines is 30 m. The tan(dip angle)
is 30/CD, which is, in this case, 30/46=0.65 giving a dip angle of 33°. The direction of
dip is about 150° relative to North measured over East, the direction of strike 240° or
60°, depending on the viewpoint of the observer. The levels and positions of the points
A, B and C may have been observed in boreholes or from the junction between geo-
logical surfaces and contour lines which can be seen on geological maps.
The shape of an outcrop of a geological surface depends upon the complexity of
both the surface and the landscape at which it emerges. Figure 4.3 shows outcrop forms
on the same landscape for:
a a uniformly dipping bed,
b a symmetrical syncline,
c a symmetrical anticline,
d a plunging syncline.

Fig. 4.3. Outcrops of geological surfaces resulting from the contact of strikelines with surface contours.
The landscape is the same in each case. a uniformly dipping geological surface; b symmetrical syncline;
c symmetrical anticline; d syncline plunging to the southeast
The outcrops in Fig. 4.3 are of a single geological surface but any geological layer is
bounded by two surfaces. These surfaces are defined usually by changes in lithology
between one layer and that underlying or overlying it. Figure 4.4 shows Fig. 4.3a with
two sets of strikelines depicting the top and bottom of a dipping bed of rock. A bore-
hole at point A (in Fig. 4.4) would encounter the top of the bed at elevations of about
180 m and the bottom at about 160 m, which, since A is at an elevation of about 225 m,
are at depths of 45 m and 65 m respectively.
In the figures strikelines have been drawn between intersections of outcrops and
contour lines and it has always been possible to draw at least one strikeline between
two points of intersection of a particular contour and the outcrop. Unfortunately, such
simple situations are seldom encountered in nature, for most outcrops are at least
partially concealed under soil and vegetation. However, if dip and strike can be mea-
sured on a bedding plane within the outcrop then strikelines can be extrapolated to
indicate the location of outcrops under a cover of soil or vegetation (Fig. 4.5).
In the figure the geologist has been able to map only a small part of the outcrop of
a bed, the remainder being obscured by vegetation cover. Strikelines must pass through

few but strikelines may be

then interpreted to give a pos-
tulated outcrop for the bed
the intersection of the outcrop and the contours but their direction is uncertain. How-
ever, some dip and strike measurements on available exposures gives the direction of
strike so that top of bed strikelines can be drawn for 150 m and 200 m and bottom of
bed strikelines for 150 m. This is sufficient to draw strikelines to define the total out-
crop throughout the area. The outcrop drawn is best described as ‘postulated’ because
it is assumed that the thickness of the soil cover concealing the outcrop is negligible.
If this thickness was significant, say of the order of more than three metres, then the
outcrop of the bed would have to be drawn on the surface of bedrock underneath the
varying thickness of soil cover.
In broad scale general geology, such as employed in the mining or oil industry, the
plotting of outcrop locations in such detail is not of great importance, but it is of tre-
mendous importance in engineering geology. Thus, if the bed outcropping in the fig-
4.3 · Understanding Geological Maps 99
ure was a worked coal seam containing unstable cavities and it was required to build
on safe land free of hazards of potential instability then it would be obviously of vital
importance to know exactly where the seam outcropped under the surface cover.
4.3.1
Interpretation of Geological Maps – Example
Figure 4.3a–d shows outcrop patterns for a single surface in circumstances of increas-
ing structural complexity. In reality the situation may be rather more complex, for beds
do not necessarily maintain uniform thickness, may not be continuous as a rock type,
folding may be severe and asymmetrical and the structure may be faulted. In many
complex areas, it is almost impossible to understand the structure only from the study
of the outcrop pattern and the topography. Measurements of dip and strike at as many
locations as possible are necessary to aid interpretation. It is also of great value and
often essential to know the relative age relationships of the various layers. In sedimen-
tary rocks, this is undertaken by palaeontological studies and because few engineer-
ing geologists have sufficient expertise to undertake such studies, they might have to
be aided in the course of mapping by a palaeontologist and/or stratigrapher.
It is fortunate that most engineering geologists have to deal with relatively small
areas for within a small area it may be found that the geological structure is reason-
ably uniform. However, greater accuracy is required for the location of boundaries than
for other types of geological work. Thus in engineering geological mapping of, say, a
dam site, a significant boundary may have to be surveyed (using precise survey tech-
niques) rather than sketched on to the map.
The following theoretical example illustrates how the techniques of drawing
strikelines may be used to solve problems of engineering importance. Figure 4.6 shows
a simple geological map of an area in which it is proposed to build a dam; the line of
the crest of the dam is shown.
The shales that would form the foundation rock are believed to be highly weath-
ered and a 50 m deep excavation may be required to reach fresh shale. From the shape
of the outcrops of the fault and the dolerite it can be deduced that the fault dips up-
stream and the dolerite sill down stream. The question is whether they will be encoun-
tered in the foundation excavation. To give an answer strikelines must be drawn for
the fault and for the dolerite. Both top and bottom dolerite strikelines have been drawn
in Fig. 4.7 although only strikelines for the top of the dolerite are necessary in this
case.
The elevation of the base of the dam at the river is about 60 ma.s.l. (above sea level)
so that the bottom of the excavation would be at +10 ma.s.l. Beneath this point, the
strikeline for the top of the dolerite would be about +20 ma.s.l. and that for the fault
at about –50 ma.s.l. Thus, it is likely that dolerite would be found below the river lo-
cation in the excavation. Under the west dam abutment the top of the dolerite at about
+60 ma.s.l., would not be encountered in the foundation excavation to +10 ma.s.l.;
under the east abutment the dolerite lies at about –40 ma.s.l., far below the bottom of
the foundation excavation. This implies that dolerite would be found in the centre and
to west of centre of the excavation. Such an interpretation of the map would not be
definitive for it is assumed that the dolerite dip and thickness remains uniform be-
tween the nearest outcrop and the dam site. However, it does reveal a potential prob-

Fig. 4.8. A cross-section that could be drawn to illustrate the geology that might be encountered in the
foundation excavation. Note that, in order to show sufficient detail, the scale of the cross-section is larger
than that of Figs. 4.6 and 4.7
lem, which would have to be further, examined in the investigation by boreholes and
other means. Another problem worthy of investigation is that of the fault. The fault
and the dolerite intersect; their junction is plotted on the map (Fig. 4.7).
In the interpretation in Fig. 4.8, it has been assumed that the fault cuts through all
rocks. However, it is possible that the fault existed before the intrusion of the dolerite.
In practice, this would be of some importance, perhaps not so much to the dam but
certainly to any diversion tunnel to be built through one or other of the valley sides.
Extra geological studies would be required to establish this point. It should be noted
that the answer to the problem was obtained from drawing strikelines; the cross-section
was only used to illustrate the answer for the benefit of a report reader who was per-
haps, unfamiliar with strikeline maps.
The discussion above has been directed mostly towards bedded rocks. Large igne-
ous bodies, such as batholiths and laccoliths, follow no geometrical pattern that can
be forecast in detail and their shape underground can mostly be interpreted only rather
vaguely from a study of surface outcrops. Sedimentary deposits, such as braided stream
deposits, reefs, sand channel deposits and so forth are very irregular in shape and their
location and shape underground can seldom be established from a study of surface
outcrops, even with the help of a reasonable number of boreholes. It is thus most im-
portant to recognise the nature of rock and soil materials to gain an idea of the way in
which they were deposited or intruded. If they are so irregular that the techniques
described above, either with or without the help of information from boreholes, can-
not be used other techniques, generally geophysical, must be used to describe the shape
of boundary surfaces underground.
4.4
Mapping at a Small Scale
Most newly graduated geologists have had some training in the rudiments of geologi-
cal mapping but this is not always an adequate preparation for mapping in engineer-
ing geological practice. The following hints regarding mapping for engineering pur-
102 CHAPTER 4 · Maps
poses on small and large scales may be of value to those beginning to undertake this
fundamental geological activity. For engineering projects mapping on a scale of greater
than 1:5000 (e.g. 1:25000) may be considered small scale and would be applied to
problems of general planning such as, road and tunnel locations, locations of construc-
tion materials, and the description of geological conditions in a reservoir area; many
examples can be found in the literature (Rengers et al. 1990).
4.4.1
Starting
The first step in such work is to assemble existing geological and contoured topographi-
cal maps, aerial photographs, and satellite imagery. An evaluation of this information
will give an idea of the geology of the area, the location of outcrops and, in particular,
the existence of geomorphological features, such as landslides, which may not have
been recorded on the geological map. It is also of value to establish how any existing
geological map was produced (whether, for example, from aerial photograph inter-
pretation with field checks or by extensive field work) and the degree of detail shown.
It is not uncommon to find older maps showing broad areas with a single formation
name while an adjacent younger map divides the formation into many sub-formations
as a consequence of a more recent elaboration of regional stratigraphy. The next step
is to visit the area to check on the validity of the existing maps, become acquainted
with the soil and rock types, consider the problems of establishing the location of
observations, and examine accessibility. With this information, it is then possible to
plan the ensuing work.
4.4.2
Covering the Ground
An initial problem is how to move around the area in the most effective and efficient
way. This will depend upon terrain, road and path networks, climate and vegetation,
but it should be remembered that the aim of mapping is not to provide the geologist
with a fitness exercise but to bring his or her sensory equipment (eyes, hands and brain)
into contact with the geology. Thus, vehicular transport is clearly of advantage in ar-
eas with a good road network, boats may be needed to examine riverbanks, coastlines,
and so forth. The writer once found travel on horseback to be particularly useful, for
the horse can carry equipment and there are few parking problems. Accessibility and
transportation will divide any area into smaller zones and thence indicate a plan for
working.
In each part of the area, consideration must be given to establishing the location of
observations. Global positioning systems (GPS), remote sensing imagery (aerial pho-
tographs, radar images, etc.) in the field, topographical maps, and a compass allow
positioning to a degree of accuracy appropriate to the scale of the final map. A good
sighting compass is also required.
The map to be made must depict geology, geological structure, and geomorpho-
logical features. Geological units are established by lithology and stratigraphy. If the
map is for engineering purposes then engineering geological units may replace geo-
logical units. The engineering geological units are not necessarily the same as any
4.5 · Mapping at a Large Scale 103
lithological or stratigraphical units shown on existing geological maps but may con-
sist of rock or soil assemblages of homogeneous and uniform geotechnical character-
istics. No geological mass can be truly homogeneous and uniform so a homogeneous
unit here implies a mass with geotechnical features, such as strength, discontinuity
spacing etc. which fall within limits specified by the investigator. The limits defining
such engineering geological units could well be related to the engineering purpose
for which the map is being constructed and thus might be defined by a soil or rock
mass classification system (see below). Much thought must be given to the purpose,
means, and methodology of establishing such units before detailed mapping begins.
The map must also show geological structure because the successful construction
of many engineering works, such as tunnels, slopes, and quarries depends upon the
orientation of discontinuities and location of faults. Geomorphological features, such
as landslides, are probably best recognised from aerial photographs but field exami-
nation may indicate whether they are active or not. On the ground surface irregulari-
ties may result from the underlying geology or geomorphology but can also reflect
the past activities of man. Such features range from Bronze Age fortifications through
open pit and underground mines to World War trenches.
In the early phases of mapping, work will tend to be concentrated on the best ex-
posures, which may be examined in some detail. Less well-exposed outcrops may then
be placed in their correct unit as experience and confidence is built up. If, as is
common, the best exposures are man-made, such as road cuts, they may show features
that should be recorded although they do not form part of the engineering geological
unit. Thus, excavated slopes may indicate the suitability of the excavation method ap-
plied and their stability, or instability, may suggest values for the strength parameters
of the discontinuities they contain.
4.4.3
Hazards
Fieldwork is not without its hazards. Adequate provision must be made to overcome
climatic difficulties so that in desert areas, for example, sufficient water must be avail-
able at all times. In jungle, watch must be kept for poisonous snakes and insects. In
less romantic but sunny environments, it is sensible not to work when the sun is high,
but to start as early as possible in the morning and thence stop when it gets too hot.
Whatever the climate, suitable and perhaps conspicuous, clothing should be worn and
the means of attracting attention, such as a whistle, carried. Survival equipment should
be carried, remembering that two broken ankles on exposed ground in winter could
be deadlier than snakebite in the jungle. However, the two greatest safety measures
are always to work with an assistant (and failing that, to ensure someone knows where
you are intending to work and route you will use) and to keep your mobile phone in
working order.
4.5
Mapping at a Large Scale
Large-scale maps are those devoted to the depiction of relatively small surface areas
in great detail and range from about 1:1000 (for the geology of a dam site) to about
104 CHAPTER 4 · Maps
1:50 (for a rock slope or tunnel). They are prepared for an engineering geological pur-
pose.
4.5.1
Foundation Areas and Excavations
The largest likely map is that of a proposed dam site. Here the location of engineering
geological unit boundaries and discontinuities must be undertaken with accuracy so
that standard survey techniques must be used to establish boundary and outcrop lo-
cations. It is probable that the dam site has already been chosen based on general ge-
ology, river hydrology and topography and that access roads and tracks for moving
drilling equipment are being constructed. In such a case, if there are insufficient natural
outcrops to allow the construction of an adequate map it may be made using excava-
tion machinery or explosives. A good map is essential to the interpretation of later
borehole information and outcrop examination offers three-dimensional information,
which may be difficult to derive from boreholes. It is desirable that such maps are made
including a grid reference system (preferably a national system) and elevations related
to a stable site benchmark. In a foundation excavation, mapping may be undertaken to
fulfil the requirements of a rock mass classification system, either existing or devised for
the particular purpose. Location of major discontinuities must be plotted accurately.
4.5.2
Rock Slopes and Major Outcrops
In the case of the ‘natural’ outcrop, the first thing to do is to establish how natural it is.
Half boreholes of some length and of the order of 10 cm diameter surrounded by
crushed rock indicate modern blasting; shorter, usually less than a metre, boreholes
of diameters of three or 4 cm and often without significant crushing indicate much
older blasting using gunpowder. The former may have brought about significant dis-
ruption of the rock slope, the latter probably not. By examining the relationship of
these relict blast holes to the rock blocks in the slope it may be possible to assess
whether or not any recent movements have taken place in the slope. Older slopes have
plants and trees growing on them. Large trees may be more than 50 years old and their
roots may have penetrated deeply into the rock mass. The author was once fortunate
enough to be able to trace a root passing through the rock mass for about 30 m from
the only tree growing on the top of the slope. Tree roots as they grow widen rock joints
and dislodge rock blocks. Tree trunks bent near their bases and thence growing verti-
cal may indicate past slope movement. Permanent or transitory (marked by dried al-
gal growths) seepages may issue from the rock face. Their emergence from particular joints
may indicate a greater than usual aperture for that set of joints. Blasting disruption,
plant growth and seepages are clearly relevant to slope stability problems but if, for
example, the outcrop is being examined because it is close to a proposed tunnel align-
ment, any slope movement will affect the relevance of any measurements made of dis-
continuity orientation, aperture, persistence or infill to the unmoved ground at depth.
Having established the condition of the outcrop, the next problem to overcome is
how to describe it and how to take any measurement that must be made. This is not
easy to do and it is prudent to examine the whole outcrop before deciding, for example,
4.5 · Mapping at a Large Scale 105
how many rock types should be distinguished. It is no good starting at one end of the
slope calling a rock simply ‘sandstone’ to find, as the observer progresses, there are six
types of sandstone, differing by grain size, colour and strength, because then the first
descriptions must be revised. The author, in his own work, has usually tried to make
any examination of a significant slope last two days, the first being used to determine
what should be done in the second. Few clients are entirely happy to see an engineer-
ing geologist sitting down looking at a slope and thinking; activity is required. Fortu-
nately, there are routine tasks that must be performed, such as measuring slope di-
mensions, heights, etc., which, while being undertaken, allow an impression of the
geology to seep into the subconscious. Scan-line surveys, undertaken often at the foot
of slopes, involve recording the orientation, condition, and position of every disconti-
nuity encountered along the line of a measuring tape at a convenient height along the
base of the slope. While this work produces an impressive discontinuity database, it
also allows the observer time to gain a general impression of the rock mass.
First Phase
This first phase of work would be done without the benefit of any kind of plan of the
rock outcrop. It is useful, if satisfactory camera viewpoints can be found, to construct
a photo mosaic of the outcrop. A photo mosaic for immediate use may be made using
a digital camera and computer processing to combine the mosaic to one image. Ste-
reo photo pairs may also be made for later analyses, for example, for discontinuity
mapping. This may be annotated in the field in the next day’s work. What is recorded
in the field depends upon the combination of information required (to address the
engineering problem) and the information available (as displayed by the rock outcrop).
For many problems the basic data required will include:
(cid:1) the distribution of the various rock and soil types to be seen in the outcrop and their
geotechnical description,
(cid:1) weathering zones,
(cid:1) presence of water and seepage locations,
(cid:1) information regarding the character and orientation of the discontinuities, noting
the location of observations in three dimensions.
It is also important that the nature and position of major discontinuities that may
define major rock blocks are recorded, together with the limits of domains of struc-
tural uniformity that may aid slope stability analysis.
Such fieldwork requires instrumentation. The following would be adequate for most
outcrop descriptions:
(cid:1) compass clinometers to measure dip and direction of dip on a surface,
(cid:1) a sighting compass to measure directions of strike, slope etc. from a distance,
(cid:1) a sighting clinometer, for slope inclinations and dips of discontinuities that cannot
be reached for direct measurement,
(cid:1) a thin stiff flat board to be placed on a discontinuity to allow an average dip meas-
urement to be taken,
(cid:1) a fold out 1 m long carpenter’s rule, with built in level,
106 CHAPTER 4 · Maps
(cid:1) several tapes, about 50 m long,
(cid:1) a heavy hammer, with one large and one small strong chisels, the latter perhaps with
a tungsten steel insert cutting edge,
(cid:1) long nails (to drive into cracks to fix tapes to); chalk, spray paint,
(cid:1) a powerful telescope or binoculars,
(cid:1) a carpenter’s profile comb (to help measure asperity and waviness angles on discon-
tinuity surface undulations).
Besides these, but depending on outcrop size and aspect, it may be useful to have:
(cid:1) a pair of high accuracy aneroid barometers, to measure heights on a rock slope (one
for base station, the other for field use),
(cid:1) a nautical sextant (for locating by measuring angles between markers on a surveyed
base line),
(cid:1) an optical rangefinder, which will measure distances within the range 10–100 m.
Perhaps the most necessary aid to outcrop examination is a field assistant, if only to
carry all the clobber! Noting discontinuity data goes very slowly if it has to be done by
the observer. In the author’s experience, many important field observations are made with
one hand tightly gripping a tree branch while balanced on a wobbly boulder half way
up a cliff. In such situations, dictation is both safer and better than trying to write notes.
The comments above would relate to both natural and man-made exposures. Clearly
there is an element of hazard in such work and the use of an assistant does decrease
the risk. The risk is perhaps highest in recent man made exposures, particularly if
enthusiastic blasting has made these. Steep rock slopes of this nature are best avoided
if recent heavy rainfall has caused seepages to emerge from the outcrop. In all slopes,
of whatever type, the examination should include the usually gentler slopes running
back from the top of the steeper rock face. These may show tension cracks, which, if
they are very close behind the rock face, would cast doubt on its short-term stability.
For safety’s sake, it is thus best to look at the slopes above the top and sides of an out-
crop before commencing a detailed examination of the face itself. Naturally, besides
recognising geological hazards, such local regulations as may exist regarding health
and safety legislation should be followed.
The principal difficulty in such work is that, unless the slope can be climbed, knowl-
edge of the upper parts is limited. Those expert in rock climbing may find that it is
quite easy to get to the top but much more difficult to go to particular locations on the
slope. If the survey of a rock slope shows it to be unstable, the next step may be to
design stabilisation works. To do this a three-dimensional picture of the rock mass
behind the slope is needed in order to determine the length, location, and number of
any bolts, pins, drain holes and grout holes required for stabilisation.
Long Rock Faces
In the case of a long rock face giving problems of rock falls, one of the first tasks is to
establish the relative stability of the various parts of the face. This is necessary in or-
der to plan the stabilisation works, which might take several years to complete. The
first need is a topographic survey and if finances allow this is best-undertaken using
4.5 · Mapping at a Large Scale 107
terrestrial imagery. Stereo-pairs of photographs and digital images are taken and from
these a contour plan is produced. These contours are drawn relative to a vertical da-
tum plane set in front of the rock face. The plane usually follows the general direction
of the rock face; contours are then lines joining points of equal horizontal distance
from and normal to the vertical datum plane. Such plans should also show loca-
tions of major fractures, patches of vegetation etc. on the rock face. If the contours
are drawn at a close contour interval, say 0.2 m, the contour lines give a picture of the
topography. The combination of field geological survey and study of the terrestrial
topographic map and photographs should allow the definition of zones of relative in-
stability (Price et al. 1988). Apart from the obvious purpose of seeing where work must
be done the survey also helps the selection of working zones. Stabilisation work can
be hazardous if approached carelessly. It is useful to locate the working zone of un-
stable rock between zones of better stability to which the scaffolding may be bolted
and bolts set in as secure points for safety cables across selected parts of the unsafe
area.
Detailed Surveys
Once zones of relative instability have been established, the areas where work is to be
undertaken must be mapped in greater detail. When access scaffolding has been erected
against the face, the scaffolding framework may be used as the datum plane from which
measurements may be made to draw contours. Figure 4.9 shows how any point P on
the rock face may be given x, y, z coordinates relative to the scaffold datum plane. If a
contour plan of the face has been made it may be better to follow that. Geological sur-
vey has to be undertaken on the scaffolding including measurement of discontinuity
orientation. Dip can be measured using a clinometer but because the scaffolding is
magnetic, strike must be recorded by tape and chalk mark measurements on the scaf-
fold boards to give strike angles relative to the datum plane (Fig. 4.9).
The three-dimensional picture of the rock face can be built up either mathemati-
cally, in a computer drawing program, or by the production of and measurement from
cross-sections. The aim is to produce strikelines for the discontinuity planes that bound
rock blocks and through which bolts or pins must pass to bind unstable rock to a
secure backing mass. The vertical separation between scaffolding platforms (lifts)
is usually about 2–2.25 m with a handrail at about 1 m above the platform. The con-
venient working zone for drilling holes into the rock face is about 1 m wide along
the middle of the lift so measurements for cross-sections, contours etc. are most
appropriately made at handrail level with, if topography and/or geology are com-
plex, measurements at floor level. Cross-sections can then be constructed at hand-
rail and floor levels to show depths of block bounding discontinuities behind the
rock face.
The joints and other discontinuities that are projected back into the face and which
would be considered to bound rock blocks must be selected on the basis of their ap-
pearance on surface. Thus, a fault would be considered to be a feature which would be
expected to have considerable persistence. The persistence of other joints into the face
would be expected to be comparable with the persistence of their trace on the face.
The cross-sections should also contain some indication of the opening of the discon-
tinuity, with particular reference to changes in the openness. Such displays are neces-

sional co-ordinates for points
(P) on the rock face by meas-
urements from the scaffolding.
The front face of the scaffolding
is the vertical datum plane
sary to discover how the movement occurred. Thus, a block that has a uniformly open
backing joint may be judged to have slid forward on some basal plane. If the backing
joint is more open at the top than at the bottom some rotational movement would be
the more likely mode of displacement.
It is most important to try to discover how a face deformed to reach its present
condition. If, for example, a block can be seen to have slid forward on a basal plane it
follows that the angle of shearing resistance of the surface of the plane will have fallen
below its original value because asperities on the plane have been ground down by
the movement that has taken place. If backing joint openings can be seen to have re-
sulted from movement, but no obvious basal plane of movement is present, it follows
that the rock mass must be disrupted and loosened by a multiplicity of many small
joint openings, so that the whole rock mass is weakened.
4.5.3
Tunnels
It has now become almost standard practice to map tunnels and chambers in engi-
neering geological terms, as the tunnel advances. Such maps show geology, major
4.5 · Mapping at a Large Scale 109
discontinuities and may display the results of a rock mass classification system. They
have a number of objectives, the most important of which are:
(cid:1) to record the geology encountered, so that the site investigation data may be reinter-
preted with this new data to give a better picture of the geology to be encountered
in the rest of the tunnel drive;
(cid:1) to check the success of any rock mass classification system used to predict support,
rate of advance, cutter wear etc. against that achieved so that, if necessary, system
modifications may be made.
Tunnel length, width, and height dimensions must be recorded together with roof
and floor elevations. Usually little can be seen of the floor of the tunnel so that map-
ping is confined to sidewalls and roof. In tunnels that are lined or shotcreted, work
has to be undertaken quickly between the advancing working face and the following
support, giving little chance for lengthy consideration of geological details. A clear idea
of the necessary data to be recorded must be established before beginning work. Ori-
entation readings require an illuminated compass and clinometer. Data recorded need
not to be restricted to a rock mass classification system and should always include the
basic geology, discontinuity aperture and locations of water inflows.
Drawings presented are commonly in the form of foldout maps, prepared as shown
in Fig. 4.10. The same sorts of drawings may be used vertically for shaft descriptions.
These are usually large diameter holes and thus circular. The investigator is lowered

down the shaft in a steel cage to examine the sides. This precludes the use of the geo-
logical compass to measure orientation so usually four tapes are stretched from top
to bottom from the cardinal points of the compass on the surface. The depths of bound-
aries or discontinuities crossing the tapes are noted and dips and strikes can be cal-
culated. This type of work is subject to the normal hazards of tunnelling.
4.5.4
Mines
Engineering geologists examine mines, usually long abandoned, to determine their
stability. The need to do this often stems from a recent collapse causing damage or
injury. The mines are usually some variant of the room and pillar system and atten-
tion is focussed on:
(cid:1) room and pillar dimensions (width, length and height) for these are necessary in
order to calculate stability;
(cid:1) strengths of the rock composing floor, pillar and roof and variations in strength (both
compressive and tensile) throughout the mine;
(cid:1) the long-term behaviour of the pillar and roof rocks i.e. creep characteristics;
(cid:1) the location, frequency, persistence, and aperture of natural discontinuities in pillar
and roof;
(cid:1) the location, frequency, persistence, and aperture of induced discontinuities (cracks)
in pillar and roof as a consequence of stress and decay;
(cid:1) locations of collapses and a description of the type of collapse;
(cid:1) locations of water seepages;
(cid:1) zones of weathering;
(cid:1) features associated with the type of rock being mined, for example, solution cavities
and earth pipes in limestone, variations in coal quality in coalmines;
(cid:1) organic (lichens etc.) or mineral growths (calcite etc.) whose presence on the crack
surfaces might indicate the antiquity of the crack formation;
(cid:1) root growths through the mine roof.
The data is presented on a map paying particular attention to roof and pillar di-
mensions for these should be as accurate as possible for stability calculations. Eleva-
tions of floor and roof are also needed. To calculate overburden pressure on pillars
detailed knowledge of overburden characteristics and groundwater conditions is de-
sirable and the map of surface topography must be securely linked to the mine plan.
Examples of such surveys are given in Chap. 10.
Much of the author’s own fieldwork has been done underground in collapsing
mines, essentially undertaking surveys into pillar and roof stability. This is clearly
somewhat hazardous but the main safety precaution is to inform someone (outside
the mine) where you are working that day. While the usual dangers of falling rocks
etc. apply, there is the added hazard of getting lost. Multiple sources of illumination
should be carried. An assistant or fellow investigator is desirable perhaps not work-
ing closely together (for a roof fall could engulf both) but each knowing where the
other is. Work after unusually heavy rainfall may not be a good idea. Work in aban-
doned coalmines may require special ventilation measures as methane may form an
4.6 · Engineering Geological Maps 111
explosion risk. Also other poisonous gasses may form serious hazards, for example,
rotting of timber support beams may have caused a deadly carbon monoxide envi-
ronment. Older experienced investigators may, on a particular day, find themselves
more than usually concerned over their safety in an abandoned mine (where they have
worked before in reasonable safety) and have perhaps decided it was a good day to do
something else. Such instincts may have yet not developed in younger investigators
but they should remember that, besides gathering data, they have to survive to write
the report. Caution in such fieldwork is recommended.
4.5.5
Natural Cavities
Natural cavities are most often those in karstic crystalline limestone, but may also be
sea caves progressing by erosion in any rocks under cliff edge structures, such as light-
houses, hotels and similar coastal development, including tourist routes but in the
author’s experience, it is more often concerned with the stability of surface structures.
Estimating their stability is usually very difficult because of their irregular shape.
Clearly, a map showing elevations of roof and floor and position of caverns under-
ground relative to surface structures must accompany any examination of such fea-
tures.
Fookes and Hawkins (1988) have reviewed the problems of limestone weathering
and suggested a classification. Zhu Jingmin and Xiao Zhizhong (1982) proposed a
method for the evaluation of the stability of karst caverns. In essence their approach
was to look at a number of multi-component geological factors and, by noting the fre-
quency of their presence or absence assess relative stability. The core of their method
has been tentatively modified by the Price (1992) to include ratings (Table 4.1). The
application of such a ratings system may crudely estimate stability and the objective
of mapping would be to obtain the data to apply the system throughout the caves.
4.6
Engineering Geological Maps
Between about 1965 and 1980 it was fashionable to produce maps, described as engi-
neering geological maps, which displayed, in any area, those geological features that
were considered important to the prosecution of engineering projects. The range and
variety of maps produced is briefly described below; for a full description the reader
is referred to the report of the IAEG Commission on Engineering Geological Map-
ping published by UNESCO in 1976 (International Association of Engineering Geol-
ogy 1976). The character of these maps ranged from the simple presentation of fac-
tual data in terms understandable by non-geologists to the expression of opinion on
specific engineering characteristics of the ground, such as its bearing capacity.
4.6.1
The Past
It is useful to review the engineering geological maps that have been published in the
past. The main stream of engineering geological maps is either:
112 CHAPTER 4 · Maps
Table 4.1. Rock mass classification for the assessment of the stability of natural cavities (modified from
Zhu Jingmin and Xiao Zhizhong 1982 by Price 1992)
i special maps prepared by government agencies which are intended to show general
engineering geological conditions or to show features of particular engineering
importance to the general public, or
ii maps of particular engineering sites that are arranged to show features of impor-
tance to a particular engineering work or engineering problem. Consultants, engi-
neering geologists working as part of the site engineering staff, site investigation
contractors, and so forth, generally prepare these.
The ‘government agencies’ include geological surveys, research institutes, univer-
sities, and so on. Their maps are generally not specific to a particular site or project.
Many different types exist. They include:
4.6 · Engineering Geological Maps 113
i maps that are modifications of existing geological maps and show lithology rather
than stratigraphy.
ii maps that emphasise particular geological or geomorphological features (such as
landslides).
iii maps that serve as a source of documentary research – these would show locations
of boreholes, trial excavations, penetration soundings etc. and could be linked to an
archive or data retrieval system. Use of particular symbols may indicate the type of
borehole, depth to which it was sunk, number of tests performed in the borehole
etc.
iv maps that give opinions about certain problems, which are of engineering signifi-
cance e.g. “bad ground for foundations”.
v maps that give geotechnical data, such as depth of overburden, compressive strength
of rock units etc.
In most countries there is continuing geotechnical work being undertaken that
should be entered into the maps in revisions. The frequency of revision will depend
upon the scale of the map and the nature of the information presented on it.
The scale of maps is very variable depending upon the purpose of the map. For large
scale planning purposes scales of more than 1:50000 are sometimes used, although
many engineering geologists consider these to have no more value than to form a pretty
decoration for the office of a high ranking politician. Scales between 1:5000 and
1:20000 are necessary for detailed engineering location planning.
4.6.2
The Present
Engineering geologists working for consulting engineers, contractors, or firms of con-
sulting engineering geologists, generally prepare the engineering geological maps of
specific sites. Their maps may:
i depict site geology and geomorphology in such a way as to aid resolution of a par-
ticular engineering problem. Such maps may contain geotechnical data or, at the very
least, the description of the features mapped will be in engineering geological terms.
ii record the site geology uncovered during construction, again using an engineering
geological descriptive vocabulary rather than ordinary geological terms. Such maps
are based upon data recovered during site work by an engineering geologist work-
ing for a contractor or consultant.
Any data not recovered personally by the engineering geologist should be checked
for validity before being included on the map. Type (i) maps commonly accompany
investigation reports; type (ii) maps may form part of the ‘as built’ description of the
works produced at the end of contracts. Scales of these maps generally lie between
1:50 and 1:1000.
The data collected for the construction of engineering geological maps or plans
must be presented in a readable form. All maps and plans must contain the following
background information if they are to be of use:
114 CHAPTER 4 · Maps
i a legible and complete topographic background, showing roads, towns, streams,
prominent buildings etc. Contour lines should be shown. The map should include
marginal comment giving the date of publication of the topographic base map.
ii the grid co-ordinate network appropriate to the project or country.
iii the scale of the map given both in figures and as a linear scale. If the original map was
in units of feet, miles etc. then the linear scale should be both in these units and in metres.
iv north points; these should be true north, grid north and magnetic north. The an-
nual change of magnetic declination should be given.
v the map should be dated giving both the date of preparation of the map and the date
of publication. The dates should be accurate to the nearest month.
vi a legend showing the meaning of all the symbols shown on the map.
viithe names of those responsible for the preparation of the map.
4.6.3
Symbology
The nature of the symbols to be used on engineering geological maps merits some
discussion. Attempts have been made to standardise symbols. Thus, the Working Party
of the Engineering Group of the Geological Society of London produced a catalogue
of recommended symbols in their report in 1972 (Geological Society Engineering
Group 1972). There is obviously every advantage in using a standard symbology, for
with time both map users and mapmakers will become familiar with the symbols and
not have to hunt through the legend in order to discover their meaning. Unfortunately,
many organisations have produced systems of standard symbology and attempts at
‘standardisation’ seem to have produced the confusion they sought to remove.
Moreover, any standard system of symbols may not be adequate for a particular
purpose and a mapmaker will have to modify or add additional symbols to the stan-
dard list. If this is necessary, it is of vital importance that they are cartographically
legible. There is always the great temptation to try to add increasingly more informa-
tion to a map by making the symbology increasingly complicated. This may be very
satisfying to the mapmakers who, because they are associated with the system devel-
opment, have no problems in understanding their own work but can be very annoy-
ing to the map user who has to try to understand the map. It must never be forgotten
that one of the main objectives of engineering geological mapping is to produce maps
that are of immediate use to the engineer. One of the motivations behind the move-
ment to produce such maps was the recognition that many geological maps were made
which only geologists could use; engineering geologists must not fall into the trap of
presenting maps that are only of use to engineering geologists. Maps must be ‘user
friendly’, easily understood and easily read. To understand the character of the ground
mass is difficult enough without having to cope with over-complex symbology.
4.6.4
Current Developments
The desktop computer was introduced in the early 1980s and rapidly became suffi-
ciently powerful to allow the development of graphic systems and databases. The
graphic systems allow the production of maps that reside in the system database and
4.6 · Engineering Geological Maps 115
can be modified and updated as new information is entered. Borehole information may
be retrieved from data bases linked to map co-ordinates. Thus, in theory, it should be
possible to ask the map-producing agency to print out a map showing the latest infor-
mation interpreted using the most up-to-date techniques. Assuming that the neces-
sary organisation to acquire, enter and process information into the data bases can be
set up and financed, a problem remains in that graphic and data base systems are con-
tinually in development as computer power increases, and data entered into an old
style data base is not necessarily easily transferable to a new one.
Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
A further development is that of Computer Aided Design/Computer Aided Manufac-
turing (CAD/CAM) systems and the Geographic Information System (GIS). CAD/CAM
systems are mostly orientated towards handling vector type of data, whereas GIS sys-
tems can handle raster data and vector data. Vector data means that the data is described
as points, lines, surfaces, and volumes that define an object and the object is the entity
in the CAD/CAM or GIS system. Raster data has the form of a regular grid or cell struc-
ture that together define the object, but each cell is a separate entity in the system.
GIS systems normally combine a (limited) CAD/CAM system, a database for the
objects and entities with property values, a visualisation unit, and a calculation unit
able to manipulate the coordinates and properties, and containing statistic routines, etc.
The combination of database and visualization makes a GIS system particular handy
for engineering geology. For example, it should be possible, if the separate items of data
necessary for rock mass classification exist, to ask the GIS to produce a particular form
of rock mass classification for a specified lithology within a given area (Fig. 4.11).
Two-, Three- and Four-Dimensional GIS
Two- and three-dimensional GIS (2D-, 3D-GIS) systems have been developed. In 2D
systems, the coordinate system in the database can only store two coordinates, nor-
Fig. 4.11. Geographical Information Systems can combine various sources of map information to give
the desired output map (after Orlic 1997)
116 CHAPTER 4 · Maps
mally x and y. Properties are then assigned to these coordinates. The 2D referenced
properties can be manipulated in various ways, such as, addition and subtraction of
properties, statistical calculations, etc. and be visualised. 2D systems are basically no
more than a map visualisation tool with the capacity to overlay different types of zero-
(point), one- (line) and two- (surface) dimensional information. The limitations of
these systems in engineering geology are large as it is not possible to represent the
sub-surface accurately. 2D systems can only handle a projection on a surface of the
sub-surface boundaries and properties, similar to a map or cross-section made by tra-
ditional drawing methods. The advantage of the systems is that they are relatively
simple and easy to handle. Sometimes the term 2.5D is used to characterise systems
that allow the third coordinate (z coordinate) to be stored as a property value. A bound-
ary model representing the sub-surface can then be made, however, the properties in
the space between the boundaries are not defined in the database. In addition, it is
not possible to store boundaries with multiple z values belonging to one x, y coordi-
nate pair. In 3D systems, the coordinate system in the database consists of three coor-
dinates, normally x, y and z. Boundary surfaces can be defined and between the bound-
aries properties can be defined for each point leading to the definition of volumes (so-
called ‘volume model’). Manipulation of the properties is similar to that for the 2D
systems with the extension that also volumes can be manipulated because the statisti-
cal and calculation routines are three-dimensional. 3D-GIS systems therefore repre-
sent the sub-surface accurately. Four-dimensional systems (e.g. spatial with time) have
not (yet) been made, however, some numerical calculation programs include a 3D-GIS
system and can store different realisations of a numerical calculation. This apparently
is a 4D system, but is at present without 4D data manipulation options, such as prop-
erty addition or 4D statistical routines.
GIS in Engineering Geology
A full three-dimensional GIS system is obviously the best system to handle engineer-
ing geological data and analyses. For regional studies, this may lead to very extensive
databases and consequently long calculation times, although this may become unim-
portant with further development of computer power. In regional studies, if property
distributions are not important and the geology is relatively simple, a 2.5D system may
be sufficient. A full 3D-GIS system is necessary for site-specific analysis in which ei-
ther an accurate representation of the sub-surface is required and/or property distri-
butions are required, or where the geology is more complicated. Figure 4.12 shows an
example of a sub-surface property model for a tunnel project and Fig. 4.13 shows the
application for a dam project. Geographical Information Systems, and in particular
3D-GIS, are able to offer considerable help to the engineering geologist however, it does
not add these qualities in itself. The quality of the output is directly related to the quality
of the input and the quality of the manipulation that is done with the data, e.g. “rubbish
in” is still “rubbish out”.
Another point that should be considered is that GIS software is complex and not
always user friendly. Hence, it is often time consuming to use the programs and this
extra time is certainly not always justified for all type of projects. Some professionals,
probably it should be questioned whether these are professionals, cut down on time
consuming operations by using simple programs, for example, 2.5D instead of the more

Quality of Published Information and Limitation of Liability
Maps, whatever their character, contain such information as was available at the time
of their compilation, which is often out of date at the time of publication and later
use. Information that contains an interpretation of available data, give those opinions
based on the understanding of the engineering behaviour of the ground of that time,
which is not necessarily that of the time of later use. If information expresses opinion,
which is virtually always the case with geology interpretations, the question arises
as to who is responsible for the quality and accuracy of that opinion. The types of
maps which are published by government agencies in any one country depend, there-
fore, upon the social, political and legal systems in that country because if engineer-
ing works are planned on the basis of the information provided by these maps, there
must be some understanding as to who is responsible for the validity of the data
they present. Virtually all liability is waived by most governmental agencies for
the information they provide, for the quality of the information, maps, GIS mod-
els, etc., and for possible damages resulting from errors or inaccuracies. In some
countries an attempt may be made to claim against a governmental agency if se-
vere negligence can be proven, however, negligence is mostly very difficult to prove,
and legal, financial, and time resources of governmental agencies are generally far
larger than that of the average engineering geologist. This places the engineering
geologist in an awkward position. He or she has to rely on published information
as it is mostly impossible to collect and analyse the underlying data, whilst also
providing the client with advice for which responsibility has to be accepted. Hence,
the engineering geologist can be legally prosecuted if the advice proves to be ei-
ther erroneous or inaccurate, even if this is due to erroneous or inaccurate infor-
mation provided by third parties. It is therefore wise to ensure that information
provided by third parties is always checked in the field and at the very least a gen-
eral impression should be acquired on the quality of the information. If in doubt, the
engineering geologist should estimate the possible consequences in case informa-
tion is wrong and inform the client accordingly. Even if the information seems
correct, it is advisable to include a waiver in the reports for all liability for infor-
mation from third parties. Whether this waiver stands up in court will be differ-
ent for each country, but in many countries, it reduces responsibility. It should be
realized, however, that clients are generally not very impressed by consultants who
try to avoid liability for their advice, and, hence, waivers should be used sparsely
to avoid irritation.

An Aid to Engineering Geological Mapping
As an aid to engineering geological mapping the author developed the system discussed
below. Regional scale engineering geological mapping must have purpose. The rock
mass classification described below is aimed at distinguishing between those rock
masses which pose no particular problems for general civil engineering to be con-
ducted on or in them from those which will give problems. The end product is a Prob-
lem Recognition Index (PRI) (Fig. 4.14).

more than that required to calculate the problem recognition index and includes data for general map-
ping, such as discontinuity orientation (Price et al. 1996)
4.8.1
Factors in the PRI
The factors considered in the Problem Recognition Index are:
1. layer strength
2. layer uniformity
3. discontinuity spacing
4. uniformity of surface weathering profile
5. material sensitivity to weathering or alteration
Layer Strength Rating (LS)
Rock strength is an obvious parameter of considerable significance in most forms of
engineering in rock. Ratings assigned vary from 10 for strengths less than 1.25 MPa
120 CHAPTER 4 · Maps
to 100 for strengths greater than 200 MPa. However, some allowance must be given
for anisotropy. In the field, layer strengths are measured in two orthogonal directions,
which, in bedded rocks, would be normal and parallel to the bedding, using a Schmidt
hammer or by geological hammer blows. The ratio minimum/maximum strength is
calculated and the maximum rock strength rating is multiplied by this ratio to give
the final strength rating for the layer; see Fig. 4.15.
Uniformity of Layer Strength (UR)
The uniformity of the geological layer is important. In an outcrop of apparently uni-
form lithology, strength ratings may vary or remain constant. The uniformity may be
Fig. 4.15. The form used to calculate the problem recognition index
4.8 · An Aid to Engineering Geological Mapping 121
judged by making a number of strength ratings at the outcrop, at maximum within a
50 m diameter zone. The percentage variation may then be calculated on the basis of:
(4.1)
Ratings are assigned to this parameter depending on the percentage obtained, less
than 10% variation getting 50 points, more than 75% being awarded 0 points.
Discontinuity Spacing (DS)
Discontinuity spacing is important in that, for most engineering purposes, small rock
blocks are a problem and large rock blocks offer fewer problems. Block shape is also
important, tabular or columnar blocks causing greater problems than cubic. The fig-
ures in Fig. 4.15 offer a rating system based on block size and form, incorporating the
basic idea that large cubic block blocks are best.
Uniformity of Surface Weathering Profile (UWP)
Weathering of the rock mass is important, particularly with regard to its uniformity.
Experience suggests that highly irregular weathering profiles will give more problems
than uniform profiles. Three simple classes are proposed, namely ‘very irregular’ (rat-
ing 0), fairly irregular (rating 25) and uniform (rating 50) (Fig. 4.16).
Sensitivity (S)
Some types of rock are more sensitive to weathering when newly exposed than oth-
ers. This sensitivity may be established by local experience and observation or by tests,
such as the slake durability test. Rocks can also contain particular minerals that may,
in certain engineering processes, give problems. Minerals such as gypsum, anhydrite,
smectites, and halite are examples. These problems are so important that instead of
giving the subject a rating, a factor is introduced applied to the sum of all previous
ratings. Factors range from 0.25 to 1 for sensitivity to weathering and from 0 to 1 for
deleterious minerals. The lowest factor of the two is applied in the calculation for fi-
nal rating.
Fig. 4.16. Rock head surface profiles
122 CHAPTER 4 · Maps
4.8.2
Calculating the Problem Recognition Index
The end rating for the rock mass is
(LSR+UR+DS+UWP)×S=PRI (4.2)
where PRI is the problem recognition index. A preliminary division has been made to
give qualifying descriptions to ranges of values of the index (Fig. 4.15).
The reader will, of course, appreciate that while this description is appropriate for
many engineering processes, it may be inappropriate for some. Thus ‘very good’ for
foundation purposes could be ‘very poor’ in terms of difficulty of excavation. The in-
dex is intended as a guide to potential difficulty. However, a low rating could result from
one of the factors, such as UWP being low. This may or may not be significant with regard
to the particular project. The user should then look into the database to find out how
the index has been calculated. Any map produced showing these indices must be ac-
companied by a database. Examples of the field classification form, the calculation form,
and a part of a map showing PRI values are given in Fig. 4.14, Fig. 4.15, and Fig. 4.17.
In Fig. 4.17 PRI values range from 10 to 254. The lowest value relates to the engi-
neering geological unit Tg22 (Middle Muschelkalk, which is also used as example in
the forms in Figs. 4.14 and 4.15); it is composed of very weak to moderately weak clayey
sandy siltstone containing large quantities of gypsum. It is highly sensitive to weath-
ering. The highest value relates to Jurassic limestones and dolomites that are strong,
and medium to very thickly bedded. Tg1 is Bunter sandstone, moderately strong and

very thick bedded. Tg21 and Tg23 are Lower and Upper Muschelkalk respectively, both
composed of moderately strong to strong limestones and dolomites but varying in bed
thickness and joint spacing. Tg3, the Keuper, contains limestones and dolomites but
also weak shales. Lack of space here prevents a detailed description of each unit, but
the brief descriptions given above show that the PRI value indicates the relative suit-
ability of the various units for most types of engineering work.
4.9
Rock Mass Classification
A rock mass description gives the reader information concerning the nature and three-
dimensional distribution of rock materials and discontinuities. Characterisation of the
rock mass is achieved by undertaking in situ and laboratory testing to assign numeri-
cal values to the mass and material. A classification seeks to establish a rock mass
quality that will determine the likely reaction of the rock mass to an engineering pro-
cess to be performed on it or in it, for example, the amount of support an excavation
requires to maintain stability.
4.9.1
Classification Systems
The rock mass classification systems consist of one or more relations, generally es-
tablished empirically by comparing rock mass parameters to engineering parameters.
This is done by:
(cid:1) recognising those rock mass features which may be of importance to the successful
prosecution of the engineering process,
(cid:1) establishing the relative importance of these rock mass features, and
(cid:1) assigning ratings to these features based on measured parameters.
The principal rock mass parameters that will be of importance for the construc-
tion of almost any engineering work in rock are:
(cid:1) rock material strength,
(cid:1) rock mass deformability characteristics,
(cid:1) rock mass weathering,
(cid:1) susceptibility to future weathering and rock material durability,
(cid:1) discontinuity strength characteristics such as roughness, aperture, nature of infilling
etc.,
(cid:1) discontinuity persistence and spacing,
(cid:1) discontinuity orientations,
(cid:1) material and mass permeability,
(cid:1) groundwater conditions,
(cid:1) the magnitude and orientation of in situ stresses.
The first classification systems were developed for tunnelling and underground
mining as an alternative for analytical and numerical stability calculations. It is very
124 CHAPTER 4 · Maps
difficult to calculate analytically the stability or support of a tunnel in a discontinu-
ous rock mass. Many rock mass and discontinuity properties should be known in high
detail to have useful results. To justify the extra effort, the results of a numerical cal-
culation should be better than results by other methods, This is, however, often ques-
tionable because rock mass and discontinuity properties are virtually never available
in the number and accuracy needed. Classification systems became very popular for
underground excavation (Barton et al. 1974, 1988; Bieniawski 1989; Laubscher 1990)
and have been developed and became popular for virtually every other engineering
application, such as slope stability (Hack 1998; Haines and Terbrugge 1991; Romana
1991), rippability and excavatability (Franklin et al. 1971), performance of tunnel bor-
ing machines (Laughton and Nelson 1996; Barton 2000; Poschi and Kleberger 2004),
rock mass failure criteria (Bieniawski 1989; Hack 1998; Hoek et al. 1992) and perme-
ability.
Some systems are fully empirical and no physical or mechanical meaning can be
given to the ratings nor to the calculation methodology (for example, Bieniawski’s
RMR). Other systems use relations partially based on physical and mechanical rela-
tions (for example, Hoek-Brown’s failure criterion and the SSPC system). Recent de-
velopments are the incorporation of probability approaches (SSPC system, Hack 1998)
and fuzzy logic or neural networks (Cai et al. 1998; Grima et al. 2000) in classification
systems. In the following sections, some systems are briefly discussed to show the dif-
ferences between them and to illustrate the most popular systems.
Deere’s RQD and Franklin’s Excavation Classification
Classifications may be set up on the basis of a limited number of determining param-
eters. Thus Deere (1968) proposed a mass classification on the single (although com-
plex) parameter of Rock Quality Designation (RQD), as given in Table 4.2.
This classification was set up with a view to use in tunnelling and foundation engi-
neering in which, clearly, the wider the joint spacing the greater the stability of the
tunnel and the integrity of the foundation rock mass. However, if such a classification
were applied to excavatability by digging machinery then an RQD of 90–100 would be
described as ‘very poor’ while that from 0–25 would be ‘very good’. Other factors would
also have to be taken into account, such as whether the rock material would be likely
to break under impact of the digger bucket teeth. The two-parameter classification
proposed by Franklin et al. (1971) is general purpose (Fig. 4.18). Similarly derived
boundaries might be used to qualify ease of excavation into categories such as ‘good’,
Table 4.2. Rock mass quality

4.9 · Rock Mass Classification 125
‘fair’ etc. (Fig. 4.19). While the relevance of the parameters of fracture spacing and rock
material strength to the process of excavation is clear there are other parameters that
influence excavatability. Thus, for example, the orientation of the principal disconti-
nuities relative to the direction of attack of the excavator will be important.

eters (after Franklin et al. 1971)

126 CHAPTER 4 · Maps
Bieniawski’s RMR
Bieniawski’s Rock Mass Rating (RMR) system (Bieniawski 1989) was developed in
South Africa for underground mining. The system is based on a combination of six
parameters
RMR=IRS+RQD+Spacing+Condition+Groundwater
+Adjustment factor (4.3)
The parameters refer to Table 4.3. Each parameter is expressed in a point rating
where the points are added to result in the final RMR ranging between 0 (very poor
rock for tunnelling) and 100 (very good rock for tunnelling). The RMR has been re-
lated to the span and stand-up time of the excavation, and many other parameters,
such as rock mass angle of internal friction and cohesion. Support of an underground
excavation is determined by the RMR parameter and results in five different support
classes.
Barton’s Q-System
The Q-system of Barton et al. (Barton et al. 1974; Barton 1988) expresses the quality
of the rock mass in the so-called Q-value. The Q-value is determined as follows:
(4.4)
The first term RQD (rock quality designation) divided by J (joint set number) is
n
related to the size of the intact rock blocks in the rock mass. The second term J (joint
r
roughness number) divided by J (joint alteration number) is related to the shear
a
strength along the discontinuity planes, and the third term J (joint water parameter)
w
divided by SRF (stress reduction factor) is related to the stress environment for the
discontinuities around the tunnel opening. A multiplication of the three terms results
in the ‘Q’ parameter, which can range between 0.00006 for an exceptionally poor rock
mass and 2666 for an exceptionally good rock mass. The numerical values of the class
boundaries for the different rock mass types are subdivisions of the Q range on a loga-
rithmic scale. The Q-value reflects the quality of the rock mass, but the support of an
underground excavation is based not only on the Q-value but is also determined by
the different terms in Eq. 4.4. This leads to a very extensive list of classes for support
recommendations.
Laubscher’s Mining Rock Mass Rating (MRMR)
Laubscher (1990) modified the RMR classification of Bieniawski (RMR*). In his sys-
tem, the stability and support are determined as follows:
RMR*=IRS+RQD+Spacing+Condition (4.5a)

128 CHAPTER 4 · Maps
MRMR=RMR×Adjustment factors (4.5b)
The main parameters are roughly the same as for Bieniawski’s RMR system
(see above). The difference is the multiplication of the RMR with adjustment factors
to result in the MRMR value. The adjustment factors depend on future (susceptibility
to) weathering, stress, orientation, method of excavation and the amount of free block
faces that facilitate gravity fall. The combination of values of RMR and MRMR deter-
mines the so-called ‘reinforcement potential’ (Table 4.4). A rock mass with a high rock
mass rating before the adjustment factors are applied has a particular reinforcement
potential. A high RMR rated rock mass can be reinforced by, for example, rock bolts
whatever the MRMR value might be after excavation. By contrast, rock bolts are not a
suitable reinforcement for a rock mass with a low RMR (=has a low potential for re-
inforcement) even if, after excavation, the MRMR is not much lower than the RMR.
The concept of adjustment factors for the rock mass before and after excavation is
very attractive. This allows for compensation of local variations, which may be present
in the rock mass, but might not be present at the location of the proposed excavation
or vice versa. In addition, this allows for quantification of the influence of excavation
and excavation induced stresses, excavation methods and the influence of past and
future weathering of the rock mass to be included.
Modified Hoek-Brown Failure Criterion and Geological Strength Index (GSI)
The Modified Hoek-Brown failure criterion for jointed rock masses (Hoek et al. 1992)
is formulated as follows:
(4.6)
where σ' and σ' are the major and minor principal effective stresses at failure.
1 3
The rock mass parameter σ (intact rock strength) is derived from a field estimate.
c
The parameters m and a are derived from a matrix describing the ‘structure’ and the
b
‘surface condition’ of the rock mass. The ‘structure’ is related to the block size and the
interlocking of rock blocks while the ‘surface condition’ is related to weathering, per-
sistence, and condition of discontinuities. Considerable development of this approach
has been made to cater for extremely fractured rock masses where no sets of clearly
defined through-going discontinuities exist; such rock is often severely tectonised; this
approach has produced the Geological Strength Index (Marinos and Hoek 2000).
Hudson’s Rock Engineering Systems (RES)
The Rock Engineering Systems (RES) methodology developed by Hudson (1992) and
Cai et al. (1998), relates the interaction of parameters that have an influence on engi-
neering in discontinuous rock masses. This includes those that have an influence on
the engineering structure and those that influence other parameters. These influences
are quantified and result in a rating for a parameter of the engineering structure. This
4.9 · Rock Mass Classification 129
Table 4.4. Support classes following Laubscher’s MRMR system (after Laubscher 1990)
last-named parameter can be, for instance, the stability or instability of a tunnel or
slope. Parameters can describe properties of a rock mass, such as intact rock strength,
discontinuity orientation, etc., and external influences on either rock mass parameters
or engineering structures, such as climate, geomorphologic processes, etc. The quan-
130 CHAPTER 4 · Maps
tification of all the interactions results in a matrix from which the required param-
eter, for example, the stability of a tunnel, is determined. Quantification of the inter-
actions or influences between parameters, and between parameters and engineering
structure, can have any form; for example, differential equations, binary operations
(0 or 1, for example, for features that are either present or not present), classifications,
or numerical calculations. How these relations are established (e.g. by engineering
judgment or actually proved by testing) is of no importance. The reliability and accu-
racy of the final result depends on the reliability and accuracy of the relations (and
obviously of the input data). The methodology resembles the working of a neural net-
work, where the relations between input and output parameters in a neural network
are normally of a simpler form. The methodology is not a classification system, but
rather a methodology of thinking for engineering in or on discontinuous rock masses;
the reader can be forgiven for imagining that in many respects RES “reinvents” Engi-
neering Geology.
Slope Stability Probability Classification (SSPC)
Another approach is that adopted by Hack (Hack 1998; Hack et al. 2002) who devised
a rock mass classification system to estimate the probability of the stability of exist-
ing slopes or slopes to be cut. The data required to calculate slope stability is observed
on the rock mass exposed. However, this has suffered weathering and perhaps also
been disturbed by the methods used to excavate it, or by slope movements, and does
not represent the mass into which any new slope is to be made. Compensation factors
are employed to modify the parameter values to give an imaginary ‘reference rock mass’
which is unweathered and undisturbed. The ‘slope rock mass’ is that rock mass in which
a new slope is to be cut, and where, by the application of correction factors, allowance
may be made for disturbance to be brought about by excavation method and weather-
ing during the engineering lifetime of the slope. The final result is an assessment of the
stability of the slope (existing or new), expressed in terms of percentage probability.
4.9.2
Discussion
Rock mass classification systems have been modified since their inception and may
well be further modified with increasing experience. The failure of an intact piece of
rock is very well investigated in laboratory testing and described in various so-called
‘failure criteria’. The failure criteria for rock masses, however, are seldom directly de-
scribed for the simple reason that a rock mass contains discontinuities and to mea-
sure the strength, including the influence, of the discontinuities requires mostly im-
possibly large samples. An alternative to a failure criterion can be provided by a rock
mass classification. The above named Modified Hoek-Brown failure criterion (Eq. 4.6)
for jointed rock masses is a “failure criterion” developed specially for this purpose;
Bieniawski’s RMR (Table 4.3) and SSPC systems have been related to the angle of in-
ternal friction and cohesion of a rock mass as are used in the Mohr-Coulomb failure
criterion.
A potential difficulty with this thinking may be that as increasing modifications
improve the systems they may also inhibit the development of new approaches and,
4.10 · Further Reading 131
with ever increasing complexity, become less ‘user friendly’. It is evident that rock mass
classification systems are established and are important in all fields of rock engineer-
ing. The use of rock mass classification to translate qualitative judgement to semi-
quantitative opinion will prove a powerful weapon in the engineering geological
armoury. However, while the modification and improvement of existing systems as a
consequence of accumulated experience is clearly of advantage, it also means that any
basic defects in the system are maintained. Increasing complexity may also imply the
need for specialised training and experience to apply the system successfully. Ideally,
any system is operator independent so that any two engineering geologists, without
special training, should be able to apply it and arrive at more-or-less the same result.
An important point to realize is that the systems are completely or partially empiri-
cal. Relations may or may not be valid for other data that is not similar to the data
included in the original data set. Therefore, always check whether newer versions and
modifications have been published, and whether the system is applicable to the type
of rock mass or application for which it is going to be used. It is also advisable to be
critical of the existing systems, and not be afraid to challenge a newer system, or de-
velop your own system, even if older and more popular systems exist.

Recovery of Samples
5.1
Purpose and Principles
The first purpose of site investigation is to acquire the data needed to create a three-
dimensional geotechnical model of the ground that will be encountered and affected
by the construction of the project. This model must represent:
i the sizes and shapes of the different bodies of materials in the ground,
ii the geotechnical properties of those materials that are relevant to the project,
iii the distribution, orientation and engineering characteristics of the structural
discontinuities in the mass, and
iv the location and behaviour of groundwater.
The second purpose of site investigation is to use this information for predicting
the reaction of the ground to the construction of the project.
Access to the ground must be obtained to gain information on the factors required
to establish the model. This is mostly done by opening some form of excavation, by
describing the materials and features encountered, and by taking samples to be tested
in the laboratory. Significant data regarding boundaries, discontinuities and mass prop-
erties may also be obtained by geophysical surveys.
The excavation may be in the form of a trial pit, a shaft or a tunnel, although the
first is usually employed for minor projects, such as small uncomplicated housing
developments, while the last two are usually associated with in situ tests for major
projects. Most commonly, access is provided by boreholes which provide both descrip-
tive data and samples. Samples taken are commonly described as either ‘disturbed’ or
‘undisturbed’, the former being generally useful only for identification (or simple tests
leading to identification) and the latter for formal description and testing. No sample
is truly ‘undisturbed’ because of the process of sampling and the fact that its stress
condition must have been changed by removal from its confined condition in the
ground. Various classes of sample may be defined according to the method of collec-
tion, and the class required should be defined in the site investigation specification.
Generally, the higher the class required, the more expensive it is to sample, and a high
class should not be specified if a lower would be adequate for the purpose. Conversely,
if design parameters are to be based on the results of a sophisticated testing
programme, high classes of sample are necessary. No matter how sophisticated the test,
the results can be no better than the quality and representativeness of the sample ob-
tained.
134 CHAPTER 5 · Recovery of Samples
Consequently, almost all site investigations at some stage involve the drilling of
boreholes whose primary purpose is to gather information about the nature and dis-
tribution of geological materials and the discontinuities that ramify through the mass,
and to obtain samples which can be examined and tested in the laboratory. Frequently,
boreholes are also used as a means of access into the mass for in situ tests, to allow
inspection of the strata on the walls of the borehole, and to install instruments for
measurement of any changes which might occur in the ground conditions –
e.g. piezometers, load cells, inclinometers etc.
The site investigator is necessarily faced with the problem of deciding what, where,
and how to sample. Clearly, the frequency of sampling must be related to the com-
plexity of the geology, and the type of sampling must be related to the significance of
the geological conditions to the engineering project. Ideally, sampling should be con-
tinuous and provide a completely representative section of the strata penetrated by
the borehole. This is possible to limited depths in soft soils by means of special long
samplers pushed into the soil, for example the Delft continuous sampler, or some of
the long piston samplers. In rocks, continuous samples of core may be obtained by
good quality rotary drilling.
Unfortunately, many soils are either too strong to allow deep continuous sampling
or too weak, or with too many boulders, for successful coring. In such circumstances,
discontinuous sampling procedures must be employed, and the location of samples
required must be decided before drilling the borehole, unless the site investigator in-
tends to be present throughout the operation.
It cannot be stressed too strongly that the answer to many of these problems, and
indeed to many problems of site investigation generally, is to have some advance knowl-
edge of the geological conditions at the site. This may be obtained by a study of exist-
ing geological information, but in some cases may require a cheaper preliminary re-
connaissance investigation.
It is useful to compare the volume of ground that may be affected by the engineer-
ing construction with that sampled. Thus, for example, a 50 m square building might
be investigated by 5 boreholes sunk, at corners and centre, to the lowest limit of the
bulb of stress (about 25% stress increase) imposed by that building. If the boreholes
were continuously sampled with 100 mm diameter samples, the total volume of sample
taken would amount to no more than about 0.005% of the volume of ground stressed.
Major engineering decisions may be based on this very small proportion of sample
although so many boreholes to such a depth might be considered a rather generous
provision by many clients!
5.1.1
Drilling and Sampling
For drilling boreholes there are a number of commonly used methods, although each
has many variations of equipment and technique. The most important methods are
the following:
(cid:1) rotary core drilling
(cid:1) rotary “open hole” drilling
(cid:1) percussion boring with cable tools
5.2 · Drilling and Sampling in Rock 135
(cid:1) power augering, of various types
(cid:1) percussion “down hole hammer”
(cid:1) hand augering
(cid:1) probing
Site investigation frequently involves one or more of these methods, although some
are more commonly used than others. There are many other techniques for drilling;
for example jetting or wash boring is often used in weak alluvial sediments, but their
application to site investigation is minimal. All methods have advantages and disad-
vantages, whether in terms of cost, information obtained or quality of samples. While
it is relatively easy to sink a borehole, it requires skill and appropriate equipment to
recover samples of an adequate quality for engineering tests; good core recovery re-
quires good drillers using good equipment.
5.2
Drilling and Sampling in Rock
Very weak rocks may be drilled with a power auger using a ‘fish tail’ bit which over-
comes the shear strength of rock during rotation. All rocks may be drilled by the per-
cussive ‘down hole hammer’ which can achieve penetration rates superior to any other
method. With this method the percussive bit is driven by compressed air, with the drive
unit located in the hole immediately above the bit. In this case the samples of rock
consist of small chips about the size of a finger nail which are carried to the surface
by the exhaust air. In the previous case the samples are of similar size, but a flushing
medium like water must be used to wash the cuttings to the surface. Such samples can
really be used only for identification of the strata penetrated.
In most circumstances, including those described above, rock is drilled by a rotary
method. Rotary rigs using a toothed roller bit overcome the compressive strength of
the rock; the rock chips must be driven to the surface by a flushing medium which
may be air, water or drilling “mud” (which can be a clay suspension or one of many
polymers now available). Such a method may be employed for reconnaissance or when
no samples are required for testing, as where drilling is undertaken to determine
whether cavities exist beneath the site. When rock samples are required for inspec-
tion and testing, core must be obtained. For this purpose a rotary drill with an annu-
lar bit is employed.
5.2.1
Rotary Core Drilling
The principle of core drilling is essentially simple. If a tube, armed at its base with
‘teeth’ of a material harder than the rock to be drilled, is rotated and pushed down-
ward, a circular annulus will be cut out of the rock and a cylindrical core will pass
into the tube (Fig. 5.1a). Commonly the ‘teeth’ consist of industrial diamonds set into
a metal matrix to form the core bit. This becomes heated by friction and must be cooled
by a flushing medium which also removes rock cuttings and transports them to ground
level. To prevent cuttings jamming between the bit and the sides of the hole, the di-
ameter of the hole may be enlarged slightly by a diamond studded reaming shell
136 CHAPTER 5 · Recovery of Samples
Fig. 5.1. Drills and drilling equipment for rotary coring
screwed in place above the bit. The bit contains a ‘core spring’ (a split cylinder with
internal teeth) which allows the core to pass upward into the core barrel but which,
5.2 · Drilling and Sampling in Rock 137
when the core barrel is pulled up to surface, clamps onto the core so that it breaks
somewhere between core spring and the bottom of the borehole. In the single tube
core barrel shown in Fig. 5.1a, the flushing fluid, commonly water, flows from above
over the core and thence to the bit. This may erode the core and this, together with
damage brought about by contact with the rotating barrel, reduces core recovery. For
this reason the single tube core barrel is seldom used in rotary core drilling.
Most core drilling today is done with double tube core barrels (Fig. 5.1b). These
contain an inner tube which, being mounted on bearings at the top of the barrel, does
not rotate with the outer barrel. Flushing fluid passes between inner and outer tubes
to the bit. The core enters the inner tube and is thence protected against abrasion from
the rotating outer tube and erosion from flushing fluid.
5.2.2
Drills
The rotary core drilling rig (Fig. 5.1c) has to provide for the rotation of, and the verti-
cal load on, the coring bit. Drilling rods connect the core barrel to surface and allow
the passage of flushing fluid down to the core barrel. In what may now be termed the
conventional chuck drive drill, the drill rod passes through a drill head to which it is
clamped via a ‘chuck’. Rotation of a horizontal axle driven by the motor is translated
into rotation of the vertical hollow stem to which the chuck is attached by means of a
gear box. Downward push on the coring bit is usually given by hydraulic rams pow-
ered by the motor. The feed stroke of the chuck drive and rams is usually of the order
of 0.5 to 1.5 m, less than the length of most core barrels, which are commonly 3 m long.
This means that when the chuck has reached the limit of its stroke it must be loos-
ened from the drill rod, drawn upwards and reclamped. During this time it is possible
that the sides of the borehole might partially collapse and jam against the core barrel
or rods.
Top drive drills have a power swivel, commonly hydraulically operated, at the top
of the drill rods and have a feed stroke equal to or greater than the length of the core
barrel. Thus they lessen the chance of borehole collapse and reduce the proportion of
unproductive time spent in periodically raising the rods and core-barrel to the sur-
face. For this reason they are often preferred for deep boreholes and for investigations
over water, which are vulnerable to weather and tidal changes.
Chuck drive drills have to be carried between borehole locations, although truck
mounting is common. Top drive drills may be mounted on trucks or some form of
tracked vehicle. Both forms of drill have to be levelled to ensure verticality of bore-
holes and most truck or track mounted versions incorporate levelling jacks. Both types
of drill can usually drill inclined boreholes. If the weight of the drill is less than the
push down force to be employed then the drill may have to be anchored down by some
form of soil or rock anchors. Chuck drive drills are usually anchored down when drill-
ing inclined boreholes.
Both forms of drill incorporate winches to pull drill rods and full core barrel to
surface and these must be strong enough not only to lift the weight of these tools but
also to break the rock between the core spring and the bottom of the borehole.
Most site investigation boreholes begin in soil and rock may be reached by percus-
sion drilling. In soil the hole must be lined with casing to prevent collapse. Weak sec-
138 CHAPTER 5 · Recovery of Samples
tions in rock may also have to be lined, the casing being drilled into place with the aid
of a casing bit.
Core barrels come in various sizes which by convention (BS4019 1974) are desig-
nated by letters (Table 5.1) which also define the size of the associated drill rods and
casing. Additional letters are used to describe the various mechanical characteristics
of rods, casing and barrels. Thus, for example, casing could be described as NX or NW,
the second letters relating to mechanical design of the casing. Core barrels could be
described as NWF or NWM, the third letter relating to core barrel design. Other core
sizes exist (or have existed). One system of core sizes relating to equipment produced
by Craelius (a drilling equipment manufacturer) is given in Table 5.2.
Table 5.1. Standard core sizes
(BS4019 1974)
Table 5.2. Craelius metric sizes
5.3 · Drilling Tools 139
In general terms the depth to which a hole may be drilled and the size of core re-
covered is related to the power and weight of the rig. Manufacturers usually quote a
depth rating for the machine at given hole sizes.
5.3
Drilling Tools
The ideal objective when core drilling is to achieve 100% recovery of sample. In gen-
eral terms, the larger the core diameter the better the possibility of maximum recov-
ery, so at shallow depths in the weathered and weakened rock mass coring begins us-
ing a fairly large size, perhaps S (113 mm diameter). The size may be reduced as the
rock mass improves with depth, perhaps to H (76 mm diameter) and thence to N
(54 mm diameter). To do this, sizes of drill rod, casing etc. have also to be reduced so
that B casing fits inside N casing which fits inside H casing and so forth. There is a
general ‘telescopic’ reduction in sizes from Z to R. Table 5.3. shows the diameters of
drilling tools for N and H sizes.
5.3.1
Core Bits
Bits used for coring are cylindrical and annular. The edge is studded with hard abra-
sive materials, sometimes tungsten carbide, but more usually diamond. There is a large
variation in the design and cost of core bits, reflecting their relative performance and
durability in different rock types.
With diamond bits, the most important variations concern the shape of the abra-
sive face, which is called the ‘kerf’ or sometimes the ‘crown’ (and which may be any-
thing from planar to fully rounded), the width of the kerf, the arrangement of the dia-
monds and the nature and composition of the matrix into which the diamonds are
set. The matrix usually consists of sintered metal which may be impregnated with dia-
monds in a cheaper bit, or the diamonds may be hand set in a specific pattern of dif-
ferent sizes in more expensive types. The diamonds set into the matrix may be varied
in size and quality depending on the rock type to be cut. Soft weak rocks can be cut
with large diamonds of low quality while hard strong rocks require smaller high quality
diamonds for efficient cutting. (Here ‘soft’ and ‘hard’ are used in the strict sense of
Table 5.3. Dimensions (in mm) of drill rods, casing, coring equipment and cores. Hole and core diam-
eters are ± a few mm depending on wear of the equipment
140 CHAPTER 5 · Recovery of Samples
relative abrasivity). Coring bits become worn and may reach the point where contin-
ued use is inefficient or diamonds may fall out of the matrix. They should then be
withdrawn from service and returned to the manufacturer who may extract, and give
credit for, those diamonds that can be re-used.
Other variations in design concern the shape and arrangement of waterway ‘ports’.
The face discharge design has ports which discharge the flushing fluid at the cutting
edge of the bit, significantly reducing erosion of the core. Unfortunately these ports
also weaken the bit which may become damaged when drilling in hard rock.
5.3.2
Core Barrels
Details of the design of barrels vary from one manufacturer to another, but they come
in three types – single, double and triple tube. The requirement of the barrel is to re-
tain the core and protect it as much as possible from damage caused by rotation of
the barrel, contact with the flushing medium, raising the core to the surface and re-
moving it from the barrel. Generally, the greater the complexity of the barrel the greater
the protection, but more complex barrels are more expensive and are subject to higher
maintenance costs as well as being more prone to breakdown.
The triple tube core barrel affords extra protection to the core and may be used where
necessary, for example in coring of extremely friable rocks, such as Quaternary se-
quences and fault gouges, but it is not generally used in most site investigations, and
may not be available for that reason. It is expensive and more subject to breakdown
because of the additional complexity, but the principles of design remain the same.
Designs of core barrel vary but largely aim to reduce disturbance of the core once
drilled. ‘M’ design core barrels have an inner tube extension which incorporates the
core spring and reduces flushing fluid erosion of the core.
The inner tube may be lined with a cylindrical semi-rigid plastic liner into which
the core passes. This considerably aids the successful extraction of the core from the
inner tube (Binns 1998) and is particularly valuable in soft ground.
5.3.3
Flushing Media
With the exception of power auger drilling, all machine rotary drilling is carried out
with the aid of a flushing fluid which may be air, water, drilling mud, polymers or a
chemically based foam. The flushing fluid has the primary purpose of transporting
the rock cuttings out of the borehole so that drilling may proceed in newly presented
rock at the bottom of the borehole. The other important function of the flushing me-
dium is to cool and lubricate the bit.
Water is the flushing medium most used because of its low cost and general avail-
ability, although of course this may not be the case in arid countries. It is dense enough
to transport cuttings if the flow rate is reasonably high, and it is effective as a coolant
and lubricant. The main disadvantages are the damage it does to the rock core by soft-
ening and erosion, and its loss in permeable strata.
Drilling mud is a mixture of water and sodium montmorillonite (bentonite), often
with additives like barite (barium sulphate) to give the required properties of density
5.3 · Drilling Tools 141
and viscosity. Because of its high density, drilling mud transports cuttings at quite low
velocities, and it also provides support for the sides of the borehole by counterbalanc-
ing the overburden pressure. In addition, it cakes the sides of the hole and seals any
discontinuities which might otherwise reduce the fluid return. However, for obvious
reasons, if the hole is to be tested for permeability, drilling mud should not be used as
a flushing fluid.
Within the last decade a wide range of specialist drilling products has been devel-
oped which could, if desired, replace conventional bentonite as a flushing medium.
Different types are produced (often polymers) to suit different techniques, including
bio-degradable types to reduce pollution of aquifers, and others which can be rapidly
degraded to solve the problem of permeability testing described above.
Core drilling may be carried out using ‘stable foam’ as the flushing medium. The
foam may be used to condition conventional drilling mud, or more usually, it can be
used on its own by either high velocity or low velocity injection. The two main ingre-
dients in the foam mix are a very strong wetting agent, called the foaming surfactant,
and a high molecular weight polymer. Air is used to move the foam up and down the
hole. Foam may be used without the polymer, but once water has been encountered
or when it is necessary to support the sides or the hole, the polymer must be added.
The foam works by providing the necessary cooling and lubrication, and the foam
bubbles carry the rock cuttings up to the surface. It is also effective in sealing and sup-
porting the hole.
There are many advantages in using stable foam when good quality samples in weak
rocks or even unconsolidated sediments are required. The low velocity of the foam
does not produce as much erosion and therefore less disturbance than other media,
and the foam is degradable in a short time. Its use for site investigation work seems
assured, and good results have been attained in areas where sampling is usually very
difficult by other methods, for example in Hong Kong where samples must be taken
of highly weathered or decomposed granites, and where sampling disturbance alters
significantly the properties of the material. The main disadvantage is the relatively high
cost, but if the whole purpose of the drilling is to obtain good samples, then the addi-
tional cost must obviously be worth while. In addition, much smaller quantities of water
are required than for conventional mud.
5.3.4
Core and Core Barrel Sizes
Core barrels are usually 3 metres or 10 feet in length, and unless drilling is stopped
for some specific reason, the length of the core barrel is the length of the core run.
The size of core which it is necessary to obtain is usually governed by the purpose for
which it is intended. There may be special testing requirements which demand a cer-
tain size, but in most rocks a diameter of not less than 70 mm (approximately H size)
is adequate for good recovery, proper examination and testing. In massive, strong rocks,
a diameter of 55 mm (N size) is usually adequate, while for very weak and/or friable
rocks it may be necessary to obtain 100 mm or even 150 mm diameter (S, U, or Z size)
core. It is worth noting that if large diameter core is specified from considerable depth,
the lifting capacity of many drilling rigs may be exceeded, and it will be necessary to
use more powerful rigs simply to enable the full core barrel to be lifted.
142 CHAPTER 5 · Recovery of Samples
5.3.5
Extraction and Storage of Cores
Rock core is expensive to obtain, and it should therefore be very obvious that careful
extraction from the core barrel is an absolute necessity. Careless handling and conse-
quent core damage frequently occurs at this stage, and all suggestions to ‘loosen’ the
core by ‘tapping’ the barrel with a crowbar or club hammer should be firmly rejected.
Core can often be successfully extracted from the barrel using a piston extruder, pro-
vided it is done carefully. However, even this may damage the core. Alternatively split
inner tubes for core barrels may be used; these open longitudinally to allow examina-
tion and measurement of the core without the need to remove it. Plastic liners for
barrels may also be obtained so that the core is effectively sealed prior to removal. In
all cases the barrel should be held horizontally, and when the core is extracted it should
be slid on to a rigid plastic sheet corrugated to the same size as the core diameter. The
core can then be placed in the channel of the core box, preferably after sealing with
plastic wrapping.
Ideas on the storage of cores vary (the writer was once presented with cores in a
sack) but good practice indicates that a properly constructed core box must be avail-
able for the immediate receipt of the core. Such a box must have a hinged lid and chan-
nels of a size to fit core with plastic wrapping. The capacity of the channels should be
enough to take the whole core run, usually 3 metres, plus wooden blocks which may
be necessary to mark particular points in the run or to mark the top and bottom of a
run if it is contained in more than one box, as is sometimes necessary. The cores should
be put in the box so that they can be examined as a book is read. Boxes with core should
not be so heavy that they cannot be easily lifted by two men, otherwise they will be
dropped; larger diameter cores may be stored in single row boxes 1 to 1.5 m long.
Ideally, the first examination of the core should take place on site before any trans-
portation, but this is not always possible. In that case, the core should be transported
with great care to be stored in a suitable environment protected from the weather and
without drying-out or being heated or cooled, until it can be logged and described
accurately
5.4
Drilling Process
The object of rotary core drilling is to obtain a continuous sample of the rock, as near
as possible in the condition it was in situ before the hole was drilled. The continuity
of the sample is assessed as core recovery, which is the length of core brought to the
surface divided by the depth drilled in that run and expressed as a percentage. Loss of
core should be attributable to the condition of the ground, and should not be due to
poor drilling techniques.
5.4.1
Core Recovery
The engineering geologist may well ponder the significance of the lost core as much
or even more than the properties of the core recovered. Some clues as to the nature of
5.4 · Drilling Process 143
the material ‘lost’ may be gained from a study of the driller’s log where gains or losses
of flushing fluid, penetration rates and other information about the actual mechanics
of the drilling should be recorded in detail.
There are many possible factors in drilling which can result in poor core recovery.
Inappropriate drill size is one of the most common. Apart from the need to obtain core
of the correct size, as outlined above, small size almost invariably makes good recov-
ery more difficult. Holes which start in weathered rock should take large cores, reduc-
ing in size as fresher rock is drilled. Rigs which are not properly anchored may vi-
brate and cause core breakage and loss, which may be caused also by a number of other
factors, most commonly a too high rotation speed. Another cause is that, when the
barrel is lifted the core is broken off at the bottom of the hole, but if the core is already
naturally broken by a discontinuity, a few pieces may fail to be retained by the catcher
and remain in the hole to be over-drilled at the beginning of the next run. It is sur-
prising how many core runs end in a natural fracture.
To achieve the best possible core recovery the coring must be undertaken with the
correct blend of drilling machine, flushing media and size and type of drilling tools,
core barrel and coring bit, all operated by expert drillers using rotation speeds and
drilling pressures appropriate to the kind of rock mass being sampled. Such excellence
used only to be achieved in the mineral exploration and extraction industry where
the geology surrounding an ore deposit is well known, many boreholes have been sunk
and time has been available for the development of the optimum design of drilling
bits; however the investigations in the UK for sites to dispose of nuclear waste repeat-
edly produced core recovery of close to 100%, and good recovery is now to be expected
from ground investigations.
In site investigation the geology may not be well known (otherwise there would be
no need for an investigation), the number of boreholes may be relatively few and the
duration of the investigation too short to allow for much experimentation or to order
changes in equipment. Accordingly the best policy may be to drill cores larger than
those which may seem sufficient for the assumed geology, using drills of more than
adequate depth capacity. The advice of coring bit manufacturers should be sought for
the selection of bits.
5.4.2
Efficiency in Drilling
Efficiency is generally judged on core recovery and the depth drilled per working shift.
Once the core barrel is at the bottom of the hole the rate of penetration, bit pressure
and speed of rotation chosen by the driller must be that which gives maximum core
recovery in the rock type being drilled, and because the rock type is likely to change,
so must the other parameters. The object is to recover the best quality samples and
not just to drill a hole as quickly as possible. However, overall drilling efficiency de-
pends not only on the speed of drilling in rock, but also the speed of hoisting the filled
core barrel to the surface, removing the core, and returning the empty barrel and drill
rods down the hole, with changed bit when necessary. All drilling rigs should have
several core barrels available, so that a full one can be exchanged for an empty one
and returned quickly while the core is carefully extracted. Tall derricks on the rig al-
low a longer pull and quicker disassembly of the rods.
144 CHAPTER 5 · Recovery of Samples
Special rods and barrels are available to enable the barrel to be hoisted to the sur-
face without the need to remove all the rods. The barrel is attached to a wire cable
which passes through the inside of the rods which therefore have to have a larger in-
ternal diameter. Since the outside diameter is defined by the size of the hole, it follows
that the walls of the rods must be thinner, and must also therefore be made of stron-
ger materials. The barrel must also be of the same special ‘wire line’ design. The whole
drilling assembly is therefore more expensive, but the time saved by the facility for
raising and lowering the barrel without removing the rods is very valuable. Obviously,
the deeper the hole the more the time saved, and it is always a question of balancing
the cost of more expensive equipment against the saving of time. Most site investiga-
tion boreholes are not deep enough to benefit from the wire line system, but it is al-
ways worth considering if the hole is about 100 m or more in depth. For marine work,
where the depth of water has to be added to the depth of the drilled rock, wire line is
obviously much more frequently appropriate.
5.4.3
Integral Core Sampling
Cores recovered from the borehole may have less than 100% recovery and the orien-
tation of the cores is uncertain. In particular it may be very uncertain whether or not
discontinuities are open or closed. Integral core sampling is a method of binding the
core together so that the core emerges from the borehole as one solid stick. If a large
diameter borehole is drilled (say H size) a smaller diameter pilot borehole may be
drilled down from the centre of the larger hole through the length of the next core
run. A steel bar or tube is thence grouted into the smaller hole, some of the grout flow-
ing into any open discontinuities. The reinforced rock is thence overcored at the larger
size. If the orientation of the reinforcing bar is known at surface then the orientation
of the discontinuities may be established and the presence of grout in the disconti-
nuities may indicate their openness. The process is illustrated in Fig. 5.2.
The process is expensive, for within a particular depth range two holes have to be
drilled instead of one conventional hole, and the installation of the bar and the grout-
ing involves additional work and time; geophysical borehole logging has now largely
removed the need for such sampling because it can record the depth and orientation
of fracture traces on borehole walls.
5.4.4
Oriented Cores
There are various devices which will impose marks on the rock at the bottom of a
borehole which may be recovered in the next core run. If their orientation is known
and the cores fit well together discontinuity orientation may be established by mea-
surement relative to the marks. Much more sophisticated but relatively costly meth-
ods for assessing orientation are available within borehole geophysical logging pack-
ages but these are usually justified only in special projects either requiring deep bore-
holes or crucially affected by rock microstructure.
5.5 · Drilling and Sampling in Soil 145
Fig. 5.2. Integral core sampling
5.5
Drilling and Sampling in Soil
A hole may be made by repeatedly dropping a pointed pole on the ground. If the pole
is hollow, soil will enter the pipe and a sample will be recovered. Thus the most com-
mon method of recovering a sample of soil is to push or hammer a tube into the ground.
One of the earliest forms of drilling rig to do this was the Banka drill, which was en-
tirely man powered and used to prospect for alluvial minerals and, in the writer’s ex-
perience, for gold and diamonds. Casing was driven into the ground and samples ex-
tracted from within it using a sampling tool (the shell) raised and dropped to depths
of the order of 10 m by man power. Drillers came sometimes from families devoted to
this work and started at an early age; by maturity they had achieved a physique sug-
gesting that it would be unwise to quarrel with them.
However, today, while drilling is still heavy work, it is usually undertaken by a
motorised light percussion rig, properly called a cable tool percussion rig, but often
still referred to by the traditional ‘shell and auger’ name, despite the fact that the bucket
auger is now rarely used. A typical site investigation light percussion rig with tools is
illustrated in Fig. 5.3a. The essential features are the collapsible quadruped A-frame
with a pulley at the top, an engine to provide the power, and a winch to raise and lower
146 CHAPTER 5 · Recovery of Samples

the wire cable to which the tools are connected. The A-frame is equipped with wheels
so that the whole machine can be towed as a trailer behind a light truck or 4-wheel
drive vehicle. Such rigs may be obtained in several sizes, each bigger and more power-
ful than the last.
5.5 · Drilling and Sampling in Soil 147
5.5.1
Percussion (“Shell and Auger”) Boring and Driven Tube Samples
Site investigation cable tool rigs generally bore holes between 150 and 450 mm in di-
ameter, with about 6 sizes of tools available within this range. Since the holes are bored
in soil, they are not self supporting and of course there is no drilling mud or foam to
assist. Consequently, the holes must be lined with steel tube, usually in threaded lengths
but the sections may be welded, particularly if for some reason the casing is to be left
in place after boring has finished. The casing diameter must be slightly bigger on the
inside than the boring tools, and it has at the leading edge a cutting ‘shoe’ to facilitate
driving. A strong driving shoe is fixed to the upper end while driving by drop hammer.
There are many variations of boring tools, but the most frequently used are the ‘shell’
or ‘baler’ and the ‘clay cutter’. The clay cutter is a heavy steel tube with a long elliptical
slot cut into the side. It is dropped into the hole, with additional weight being given by
a ‘sinker bar’ which is a heavy rod, immediately attached. The cutter is hauled to the
surface after several strokes, and the clay removed with a metal bar through the slot.
In granular materials the shell is surged in water at the bottom of the hole. The rapid
movement disturbs the granular soil and puts it into suspension in the water which
enters the shell on the down stroke. There is a non-return valve (clack valve) situated
near the base of the shell, and this closes on the upstroke to retain the water and sus-
pended soil (Fig. 5.3). The shell is drawn to the surface and emptied. It is common
practice to add some water to the borehole to facilitate the progress of boring. This
combination of shell and clay cutting is widely, but inaccurately, termed ‘shell and auger’
boring, although the auger is seldom involved.
Given time, this method can drill through almost any material, if necessary using a
chisel tool. However, gravel and boulders, particularly if the boulders are not firmly
held, create difficulties. The gravel cannot be suspended in water and therefore not
removed by the shell. Boulders may be broken by the chisel, but there remains the
problem of removing the coarse debris. Driving casing in such materials is very diffi-
cult, and sometimes, because the casing cannot be kept at or near the bottom of the
hole, the bore has to be abandoned. Clearly, samples obtained by use of these tools
will be greatly disturbed and may be used only for identification, or in the case of clays,
for simple index tests.
The most common type of ‘undisturbed’ sample for laboratory testing is the driven
tube (or ‘open drive’) sample. These are taken whenever there are changes of strata or
at regular intervals otherwise. Usually, not less than 1 m or more than 1.5 m between
sample tops is the frequency of sampling. The boring tools are detached and replaced
with rods equipped with a drop hammer. The sample tube in Britain is usually 450 mm
long and 100 mm in diameter (Fig. 5.4). It is equipped with a hard steel cutting shoe
at the front end, and a driving shoe at the other. It is then driven into the ground with
the drop hammer. A clack valve allows the releasing of air and/or water as the tube is
driven. When full, the assembly is returned to the surface where both shoes are re-
moved and replaced with threaded caps after the sample has been sealed with wax to
preserve as far as possible the original condition. The 100 mm diameter sampler is
generally known as the U100 open drive sampler. U stands for ‘undisturbed’ and the
148 CHAPTER 5 · Recovery of Samples
Fig. 5.4. Open tube and piston samplers
5.5 · Drilling and Sampling in Soil 149
figure refers to the diameter. They were previously known as U4 tubes, when diam-
eters were in Imperial units (4 inches). Smaller size drive tubes are also available and
widely used in other countries. The type of tool employed may depend upon the test-
ing favoured in the country of use.
This type of sampler is easy to use and cheap. The tubes are used many times, with
more frequent replacements of the cutting shoe. However, they are fairly crude de-
vices and considerable disturbance is likely at the periphery of the sample. Samples taken
for triaxial testing are best taken from near the centre of the U100. Granular soils are
difficult to sample with the open drive tube and tend to fall out when the tube is lifted.
There are also several types of piston drive samplers, some of which may be pushed
into the ground as well as driven in boreholes. The purpose of the piston is to prevent
loss of sample by providing an air tight seal above the sample in the tube, which also
helps to increase the length of sample that it is possible to obtain from a given diam-
eter. The piston sampler shown in Fig. 5.4 is of large diameter developed by the Asian
Institute of Technology to sample the soft clays of the alluvial plain around Bangkok.
As the tube is pushed into the ground (using the hydraulic push of a rotary core drill
when seen by the writer) the piston rises. Suction reduces the chance of the sample
falling from the tube when pulled to surface.
5.5.2
Continuous Soil Sampling
Continuous soil sampling is highly desirable, provided that the sample can be taken
without too much disturbance. The stronger the soil, the more force is required to push
the sampler, and the more the soil is disturbed. While the sampler is designed to re-
duce disturbance as much as possible, continuous sampling is successful only in fairly
weak soils, although in some cases continuous samples have been obtained with the
use of special rigs where the sampling is done in conjunction with rotary drilling. In
these cases the process is more like coring than soil sampling, although the material
would not be classified as rock.
Probably the best known and most widely used continuous sampling system is that
developed by the Laboratorium voor Grondmechanica at Delft, The Netherlands. The
Delft system takes a sample of 29 or 66 mm diameter. For the former, the 2 Mg Dutch
Deep Sounding Machine is used, and for the latter the much bigger 17.5 Mg machine
is required.
The sampler head has a serrated cutting shoe and as the tube is pushed into the
ground the soil is fed into a woven sleeve, or stocking, and prevented from collapsing
by a bentonite-barite supporting fluid of similar density to that of the ground. The
stocking is surrounded by a vulcanising fluid which acts to make it impervious as the
sleeve unrolls and fills. The filled sleeve is fixed in position by a tension cable attached
to the top while it is supported by bentonite. In the larger sampler a plastic tube is
used as an inner liner, into which the sample in the stockinette sleeve is fed. In this
case, bentonite is no longer used for support but still acts as a lubricant.
With both sizes of sampler, a continuous sample about 18 m long can be taken un-
der the right conditions. The sample is removed in 1 m lengths within the sampler
150 CHAPTER 5 · Recovery of Samples
extension rods or within its own plastic tube, as appropriate. Samples are placed in
purpose made cases and should be described and sampled for moisture content and
other index tests as soon as possible. The samples are usually split longitudinally; one
half is used for examination and testing, while the other half is retained for reference.
Photographs are taken after some drying out has been permitted, when soil structures
are usually more obvious. The small samples are useful only for index tests, but the
larger samples are suitable for a wide range of laboratory soils tests.
The Swedish Foil Sampler was developed by the Swedish Geotechnical Institute. In
this sampler the soil is received by very thin high strength steel foil which unrolls to
surround the sample as the apparatus is advanced by pushing. The 40 mm sampler
holds a length of 12 m of foil, while the 68 mm sampler will take 30 m. This gives a
maximum length to the sample which can be taken.
5.5.3
Power Augers
A drill for wood, metal, ceramics, plastic and so forth, feeds the material it cuts up its
shaft and out of the hole; augers do just the same. Flight augers have a screw thread
and are fed into the ground so that material from the bottom of the auger progresses
upwards to the surface (Fig. 5.3b). Obviously, the sample is disturbed. If the auger is
hollow, (Fig. 5.3c) a sample can be taken by some sort of sampling device pushed
through the inside. However, to obtain a 100 mm diameter sample, the internal diam-
eter must be at least 150 mm, and that in turn requires a powerful rig. Another possi-
bility with large diameter hollow flight augers is to use the augers as casing through
soil to rock, followed by rotary core drilling via the hollow stem.

Hand Augers
These are hand tools operated by one or two people. In cohesive soil they may pen-
etrate to depths of about 5 m, but their limitation is man-power. There are many de-
signs usually including some form of bucket auger blade to extract the soil which can
be removed and replaced by a small sampling tube (usually 35 mm diameter, 150 mm
long), which can be pushed or hammered into the ground. There are a variety of blades,
or bits, to suit cohesive or non-cohesive soils. Two bits, a T-piece handle, one or two
extension rods and the necessary tools can be carried by one person and used for re-
connaissance work and/or mapping of near surface conditions.
5.5.5
Special Samplers
There is a wide variety of special samplers for use in very weak ground or to obtain
samples with minimal disturbance. The Bishop sand sampler (Bishop 1948) uses com-
pressed air to aid recovery of an undisturbed sample of sand, and is useful in assess-
ing the true in situ densities of sands. Rotary core drilling with special core barrels
may also be used for soil as well as rock sampling (Binns 1998), but the practical diffi-
culties of using double or even triple tube barrels can be considerable.

Daily Drilling Records
The final borehole record (Chap. 7) is composed of information derived from the de-
scription of the samples, the testing of the samples and the daily drilling record pre-
pared by the driller.
This last source of information is of vital importance. In percussion boring in soils,
the description of the strata encountered comes from the engineer’s or engineering
geologist’s examination of the samples; boundaries between strata are those given by
the driller. In shell and auger drilling it is customary to take undisturbed tube samples
at set intervals, usually something between every 1 or 1.5 m, or at ‘changes in strata’ at
the discretion of the driller. From the disturbed drilling section of the borehole tube
or bag, samples are provided as selected by the driller. Consequently the driller has a
heavy responsibility in the preparation of the final borehole record. As it happens most
drillers are qualified by experience rather than training so it is of some importance
that, before drilling commences, the driller is well briefed regarding the geology that
may be expected and the significance of that geology to the engineering project. Thus,
for example, in an alluvial plain a few centimetres of peat found in a borehole may be
of little engineering significance at that spot but could be the feather edge of a deeply
peat filled old river meander. Clearly such a feature should be noted in the daily log.
In rotary coring the investigator hopes for continuous samples and will complain
of core loss. However, calculations of core loss depend on the driller’s accuracy in
measuring the depths of the tops and bottoms of core runs. If joint openings of the
order of centimetres, as assessed by core recovery, are of importance, then core run
depths must be of equal accuracy.
Core disturbance may be a consequence of mechanical problems with the drilling
equipment. Such difficulties should be noted in the daily log.
It is obviously of great importance that the depths at which water is met or lost be
noted. Since groundwater levels are disturbed by drilling, it is customary to note not
only what happens during the course of boring but also to measure the depth to
groundwater before the start of drilling in the new working day. This may change as
the borehole progresses, depending on the depth of any casing. Thus, in Fig. 5.3a the
groundwater table would have been encountered in the sand but, once the casing had
been well established in the underlying clay further entry of natural water into the
hole would have been reduced, perhaps stopped. Thus, to understand apparent varia-
tions in groundwater levels the daily record must include an accurate account of the
position of the casing at any time during the drilling. In rotary core drilling losses of
flushing water may indicate permeable strata or cavities. Samples of water are usually
taken from the borehole for chemical analysis: it is necessary to know whether they
are of groundwater or of water introduced to assist drilling.
5.7
Probe Drilling
It is sometimes necessary, having discovered the basic geological situation on a site,
to seek to establish a boundary with greater accuracy than given by the boreholes al-
ready sunk. More boreholes by shell and auger or rotary core drilling may be unjusti-
152 CHAPTER 5 · Recovery of Samples
fied financially for such limited objectives and cheaper and quicker methods of bor-
ing should be employed. A common problem of this type is determining the depth to
rockhead. In soils (usually the softer soils) wash boring or jetting (the former with
rotary action the latter without) using large quantities of water at high pressure may
serve to reach rockhead and establish its elevation.
There are many types of rotary or rotary percussive drill, used mainly for drilling
blast holes, which will progress rapidly through rock at rates perhaps as high as 1 m
per minute in weak rocks. Cuttings are brought back to surface by water or air flush
and, while small in size, are usually sufficient to determine the basic character of a
rock. Thus this type of boring may be utilised to examine particular geological situa-
tions in detail at relatively low cost.
A common use is to detect cavities in limestone or abandoned mines. Figure 5.5
gives an example of the use of probe boreholes: Borehole 1 has found an open cavity
in a coal seam and identified the strata above the seam, Borehole 2 has passed through
a pillar and identified strata below the seam, whilst Boreholes 3 and 4 indicate that
the coal seam has been displaced by a fault and further boreholes (Borehole 5 is un-
derway) are put down to locate the fault or seam outcrop at rock head. Boring would
continue until this was done.
Such investigations require the continuous presence of an engineering geologist
to log the cuttings and continuously evaluate the boreholes so far sunk to establish
the location of further boreholes. There is a significant time lag between the cuttings
being cut and their arrival at surface and because the borehole progresses rapidly there
will be some uncertainty as to the exact depth of strata boundaries. It is useful if the

site investigation includes a rotary cored borehole to establish the sequence of litholo-
gies before such probing investigations begin.
5.7.1
Trial Excavations
One of the most useful, cheapest, and quickest ways of gaining access to formations
for inspection and sampling is by trial pit or trench. In the simplest form, the excava-
tions are hand dug with a spade. Deeper excavations may be made by machine. Rela-
tively recent advances in the design of excavators enable trenches up to 6 m to be ex-
cavated rapidly. The use of telescopic shoring frames enables safe inspection.
The advantages of using trial trenches are many. The soil can be inspected in three
dimensions in an in situ state, although some careful hand excavation of the sides of
the machine excavated trench may be necessary because of disturbance. Bulk, block
or driven tube samples can be taken from the sides or floor of the trench. In situ tests
may be carried out.
Block samples are cut by hand from material exposed in excavation. They may be
taken in both rock or cohesive soil. The procedure is often used for obtaining orien-
tated samples, in which case both the location and orientation should be recorded
before the sample is separated from the ground.
The cutting of a block sample often takes a considerable time, during which the
moisture content may change. The following precautions should be taken:
(cid:1) no water should be allowed to come into contact with the sample;
(cid:1) the sample should be protected from the wind and the direct rays of the sun;
(cid:1) immediately after the sample has been cut, it should be wrapped in plastic and bound
with waterproof tape before placing carefully in a closely fitting box.
Trial pit samples are particularly useful when heterogeneous material is to be used
for construction fill. Boreholes, because of their limited diameter, cannot sample
cobbles or boulders to gain some idea of the proportions of coarser fractions present
in a soil. This can only be done with very large samples taken from trial pits.
Shafts and tunnels are usually excavated with the primary purpose of reaching lo-
cations for in situ testing. However, any trial excavation in rock has the advantage that
the investigator can record the orientation and spacing of discontinuities, which is not
easily done on rock cores.
In weak rocks the large diameter augers used to make the holes for bored-and-cast-
in-place piles may be employed to drill shafts for geological investigation. These may
be of the order of one metre diameter and the geological conditions found in them
may be described by an observer lowered into them in a steel cage, using methods
explained in Chap. 4.
One of the problems in examining trial excavations is safety, for trial pits and
trenches are liable to collapse. Safety regulations require that such excavations be sup-
ported but such support obscures the view of the ground mass exposed and may thus
make it difficult to fulfil the objective of making the excavation. This gives the temp-
154 CHAPTER 5 · Recovery of Samples
tation to examine the pit without any support, particularly if the investigator has had
no previous experience of pit collapse. Those who have had experience of this will
testify to the great rapidity with which collapse may occur. Trial pits which are par-
ticularly hazardous are those which may ooze groundwater from some point in their
sides.
5.8
Boring and Sampling over Water
Boring and sampling over water is always more difficult and very much more expen-
sive than on land. Apart from the technical problems associated with water depth and
movement, there is likely to be a major logistical problem involving personnel, mate-
rials and supplies, particularly if the work is undertaken far off-shore.
Boring over water would be carried out from a reasonably stable platform such as
a pontoon, barge or ship. The nature of the platform necessary would be dictated by
such conditions as water depth, tidal influence, distance from shore and whether or
not the water was sheltered or open. Platforms may vary in sophistication from scaf-
fold staging built out from shore to moored pontoons, jack up platforms or ships. Float-
ing platforms and ships require proper anchoring, or even thruster devices if the wa-
ter is very deep; e.g.about 80 m or more.
All proper boring and sampling programmes must be planned, but because of the
relative cost of mobilisation over water, it is virtually certain the mobilisation will take
place on one occasion only. Particularly careful consideration of the requirements of
the investigation must therefore be given.
It is often possible to use conventional equipment for boring and sampling over
water from a stable platform. The borehole may be sunk through a conductor pipe
which is fixed between the platform and the water bottom. In situations where the
boring is done in open water and the platform is subject to heave from wave action or
gravity, a spring loaded ‘heave compensator’ may be incorporated between the top of
the drill pipe and the pulley on the tripod or A-frame.
Because the costs are so high, wire line methods are used for sampling, to speed
the process. Indeed, the need for faster drilling and sampling in off shore situations
has stimulated the development of wireline equipment which is now entering its third
generation. Even so, sampling in deep water is constrained by the lack of reaction avail-
able to push or drive a sampling tool, and a range of new techniques using submerged
equipment has developed.
5.8.1
Pushed and Driven Wire Line Samplers
Boring and sampling by wire line are still the most commonly used methods of re-
covering samples over water from a stable platform. Samples of soil are taken by driv-
ing or pushing a tube through the drilling bit which has first had the central ‘insert’
removed by wire line, and then been raised one or two metres from the bottom of the
hole. The sample tube may be driven by a sliding weight striking an anvil which is
5.8 · Boring and Sampling over Water 155
connected to the tube. The technique is very similar to that used in the Standard
Penetration Test. When driven to full depth or to refusal, the tube plus anvil and weight
are recovered by wire line.
A similar technique is used to push the tube, rather than drive it, in an attempt
to lessen the sample disturbance. After removing the insert and raising the bit,
the tube is lowered and clamped below the bit. The whole drill string is then
dropped, so that the weight pushes the sample tube into the soil. Recovery is by
wire line.
5.8.2
Submerged Rotary Rigs
An alternative to sampling by wire line from a stable platform is to use submerged
rotary rigs operated by divers. The technique is limited to about 40 m of water because
of the operating requirements of the divers. The rigs are driven by two hydraulic mo-
tors powered from a support vessel. Both rock and soil may be sampled, using wire
line methods and double or triple core barrels, including the Mazier type. Recovered
samples are usually of a higher quality than would be obtained by pushed or driven
tubes.
5.8.3
Vibro-Corers
These devices are driven by electric, hydraulic or pneumatic power from the surface.
The sample tube is vibrated into the sea bed until full depth or refusal is reached. Some
convert the vibration into percussive power to assist driving the tube, and in either
mode they may be used for driving piles as well as sampling. Penetration of 31 m in
1½ hours in very soft soils has been reported, with core recovery of 80% in mud and
100% in lodgement till.
5.8.4
Electro-Corers
The ocean floor electro-corer is a submerged remote controlled device for drilling and
sampling in water up to 100 m in depth, although a variation of it can be used in water
up to 300 m deep. The device uses the flexo-drilling technique, in which a rigid drill
stem is used that incorporates a corer and an electrically driven drill. The drill stem is
connected to a flexible rod which is fed from a large drum as the drill penetrates.
Drilling fluid is always sea water, which is discharged on to the sea bed. The proce-
dure is to drill to the required depth and then activate the corer, which operates on
the rotary principle and can obtain 1 m length of core of between 106 and 108 mm
diameter.
Similar apparatus can be used from the surface with a specially equipped ship. The
length of flexible drill pipe is increased by the easier access on ship, and the depth of
water in which it can operate is consequently much greater.
156 CHAPTER 5 · Recovery of Samples
5.8.5
Submerged Remote Control Rotary Corers
A number of these devices are now in use, and further development can be expected.
They can operate in deep water, several hundreds of metres in some cases.
One of the earliest of these devices is the Maricor, built for Wimpey by Atlas Copco,
which can produce continuous core of 60 m in a water depth of 200 m. It is hydrauli-
cally powered and adds drill pipe from a magazine store as drilling proceeds. After
each coring run, the core barrel is lifted by wire line to the surface. Core size is about
57 mm diameter.
The U.S. Navy Civil Engineering Laboratory sub-sea remote control coring device
is designed to operate in water up to 1800 m deep. It is hydraulically driven and has
two magazines, one for drill pipe, the other for core barrels. Each contains 10 lengths
of 1.5 m each, which gives a 15 m depth capacity. Each core barrel is retrieved and
stored in the magazine when full.
The Stingray has been developed by McClelland Engineers in collaboration with
the Norwegian Geotechnical Institute. It uses 75 mm diameter tubes for soil sampling;
the tubes are pushed into the material by hydraulic jacks, but rock core may also be
taken. The Stingray is designed to perform in situ cone penetrometer tests as well as
obtain material samples.
5.8.6
Gravity Samplers and Stationary Piston Corers
The simple gravity sampler is essentially an open ended tube which is dropped from
a limited height and penetrates the soil. Such devices are obviously somewhat limited
in capability.
A development of these simple samplers is the stationary piston corer. This is
dropped in free fall also, but as penetration begins, a piston which encloses the lower
end remains stationary because it is connected to the main cable by a wire that be-
comes taught when the sampler hits the bottom. The piston creates suction, or negative
pressure, in the coring tube, and as with conventional piston samplers used on land, the
result is a better recovery of sample.
5.8.7
Sample Quantity and Quality
Samples of geological materials are difficult and expensive to obtain. There should be
a specific reason for requesting samples, such as needing values for strength that can
only come from the laboratory testing samples, in order to analyse stability of the struc-
ture to be built. The quantity and quality of samples required for that purpose should
be defined before boring starts. No advantage can be gained if, for the tests intended,
inadequate quantities or qualities are recovered. Guidelines for British site investiga-
tion practice are shown in Table 5.4. The amounts given are the amounts required to
be recovered. The actual test may be performed on smaller fractions of the original,
provided the smaller fraction is representative of the whole.
5.9 · Contaminated Land 157
Table 5.4. Quantities of sample required for some soil tests (BS1377 1990)
Table 5.5. Sample quality classes (DIN 4021)
Sample ‘class’ is descriptive of the quality, which in turn defines the degree of dis-
turbance of the material during the process of recovery. The German Standard
DIN 4021 defines five classes (Table 5.5). Every sampling procedure produces some
disturbance, and, generally, for any given material the cost of recovery rises with the
increase in class. The table shows the class of sample which it is possible to obtain,
according to the nature of the material and the method adopted.
5.9
Contaminated Land
The redevelopment of sites used previously for other purposes has meant that drill-
ing and sampling often have to be completed in ground that is contaminated. There
are many hazards associated with this which have to be avoided, notably:
(cid:1) the contamination of personnel involved,
(cid:1) the careless dispatch of apparently “clean” samples that are in fact contaminated to
laboratories who test them not suspecting contaminants to be present, but later find
their laboratory is contaminated,
(cid:1) the unknowing communication of contaminated ground with uncontaminated
ground, made possible by a drill hole that passes through both and acts as a flow
path that permits water from contaminated ground to enter uncontaminated ground.
158 CHAPTER 5 · Recovery of Samples
Many countries have now developed guidelines for work at sites where contamina-
tion is suspected. Failure to follow these guidelines will normally result in a personal
prosecution of those responsible for ignoring them from organisations such as an
Environment Agency, who themselves have a duty to protect the health of individual
employees and the public at large.

Introduction
Because of the difficulties of obtaining good quality samples of certain materials (such
as sands and soft clays) for laboratory testing some tests are considered best done in
boreholes on ‘samples’ in situ. In materials whose coarse grain size prohibits taking
samples large enough to test in the laboratory, the only way to obtain test results is by
testing in situ. In rocks, whose mass properties are known to be much affected by the
presence of discontinuities, reasonable assessments of geotechnical parameters can
only be obtained by testing in situ. Access to the body of ground to be tested, the in
situ sample, is via a borehole or trial excavation. It should be noted that the excava-
tion that gives access to the ‘sample’ itself disturbs the ground and may alter its prop-
erties. Thus opening the excavation changes the stress conditions within the ‘sample’,
sometimes opening discontinuities and loosening the mass around the excavation.
Water or air used for flushing boreholes may alter the moisture content of the sample.
Such in situ tests are often thought to be tests that establish ‘mass’ properties because
the sample tested is substantially larger than that can be tested in the laboratory. In
some cases this might be true but it is prudent to think of these tests as tests on a sample
of the mass, which may be no more representative of the mass than tests on materials
are necessarily representative of the materials.
Tests of this type fall into two broad classes, namely those conducted in boreholes,
in which the common range of borehole diameters limits the volume of sample tested,
and tests in excavations which are on a larger scale, the upper limits being determined
by the mechanical difficulties of undertaking large scale testing.
The behaviour of ground masses may be monitored before, during and after engi-
neering construction by in situ instrumentation. The assessment of the structure of
ground masses may be substantially aided by the use of geophysical surveys.
6.2
Tests in Boreholes
The many tests conducted in boreholes are described here under four headings; those
that measure the resistance to penetration through the base of a borehole, the man-
made force required to deform the hole (strength and deformation tests), the amount
of fluid that can be passed to and from a hole (permeability tests), and the natural
forces that deform a hole (measurements of in situ stress).
160 CHAPTER 6 · Field Tests and Measurements
6.2.1
Resistance to Penetration
Two commonly used tests are the Standard Penetration Test and the Cone Penetro-
meter.
Standard Penetration Test
This is a dynamic penetration test carried out using a standard procedure and stan-
dard equipment and thus may be described as empirical. It was introduced by the
Raymond Pile Company in the United States to give an estimate of the degree of com-
paction (the relative density) of sand. The test is used for soils investigations all over
the world for the apparatus required is not complex nor is there any great skill required
in the execution of the test. A great mass of experience has been built up justifying its
use for foundation design purposes.
The test is undertaken at the bottom of boreholes sunk in soils by methods such as
shell and auger boring or rotary boring. The equipment consists of a ‘split spoon sam-
pler’ or ‘split barrel’ (Fig. 6.1a) which is a sample tube split longitudinally into two halves
and held together by a screwed coupling and a lower cutting shoe, all of standard di-
mensions. This is driven into the bottom of the borehole by an automatic trip ham-
mer, which allows a weight of 622.7 N (140lb) to fall on to a drive head from a height
of 762 mm (30 in). The number of blows is counted to cause the sampler to penetrate
to a depth of 450 mm (1 ft 6 in) into the soil. The blows for the last 300 mm penetra-
tion are described as the ‘N’-value. Those for the first 150 mm penetration are neglected,
being considered to have been in soil disturbed by the boring process. It is common
good practice for the driller to record the number of blows for each 75 mm penetra-
tion to see whether there was any change in resistance within the drive depth. Thus,
on a field boring record the number of blows would be recorded as:
2/3/4/5/4/5
giving a N-value of 18. It is essential that the bottom of the borehole is carefully cleaned
out, removing any loose material, before the test is undertaken.
It has long been recognised that the N-value reflects not only the relative density of
the sand but also the overburden pressure at the depth of the test. Gibbs and Holtz
(1957) showed that, for a sand of uniform relative density, N-values increased with in-
creasing overburden pressure. However, at the bottom of a borehole there is no over-
burden pressure on the sand being tested so measured N-values tend to be rather low.
N-values should thence be corrected. They are generally corrected to a relative den-
sity/N-value relationship proposed by Terzaghi and Peck which seems to be valid for
an effective overburden pressure of the order of 150 to 250 kPa. Smith (1982) has pro-
duced graphs to help make the correction; these have been modified by the author
into a single figure, Fig.6.1b, used in the following way.
Assume that the SPT-N-value measured in the borehole is 10 and that the effective
overburden pressure at the level of the test is 150 kPa. Use the horizontal axis and the
right hand vertical axis to plot the 10/150 point. The diagonal lines indicate relative
6.2 · Tests in Boreholes 161

162 CHAPTER 6 · Field Tests and Measurements
density so that the plotted point will have a relative density of about 43%. Using the
left hand axis draw a horizontal line at 43% until it meets the dashed curve. The N-
value for this intersection is about 15. This is then the corrected N'-value.
Unfortunately this is not the only way of correcting the N-value to the N'-value. Most
give an N' greater than N. N' is extensively used in calculating the bearing capacity of
and settlement on sands and thus the correction for N to N' is of great importance.
Figure 6.2 presents curves relating N' values to foundation width to allowable bearing
pressure for approximately 25 mm (originally 1 inch) settlement. Because alternative
methods of correction exist many companies issue internal company directives to
ensure a uniformity of approach in designing foundations using the N'-value.
A second correction, attributed to Terzaghi, is applied if the test is undertaken in
fine sand below the water table level. This correction is N =15+½(N'–15).
f
While the Standard Penetration Test has always been an important test for founda-
tion engineering purposes it has, since the early 1970s, also become important in the
study of liquefaction of fine sands under earthquake tremors; the N-value is used to
assess the degree of compaction of the sand deposit. N-values are usually ‘corrected’
in some way and Soydemir (1987) has described the correction factors applied to the
raw N-value in New England practice. These factors include allowing for the length of
drill rods, the type of hammer used and the age of the rope used to lift the hammer.
Dynamic Cone Penetration Test
The Standard Penetration Test sampler will not give reliable results when the grain
size of the granular soil exceeds that of sand. However, the sampler may be modified
Fig. 6.2. N'-values used to deter-
mine the allowable bearing

6.2 · Tests in Boreholes 163
by replacing the driving shoe by a solid steel cone with a 60° apex cone; the test is then
conducted in the same way as the SPT. It is generally considered that cone N-values
are comparable to standard N-values on sands of similar relative density and that these
cone N-values may be used in foundation design calculations. However, if the granu-
lar deposit contains grains coarser than gravel size the results can become very unre-
liable, for the cone may be driving a cobble or boulder down the borehole. The test is
thus not suitable for very coarsely granular materials.
Other Uses of the SPT
The simple nature of the Standard Penetration Test and of its results makes it attrac-
tive as an investigation tool and attempts have been made to correlate N-values with
properties of soils other than granular soils and with the properties of weak rocks,
especially chalk. The latter is sensitive to disturbance and, while this makes it rela-
tively easy to penetrate when boring, it is difficult to recover samples of the weaker
chalks that are sufficiently undisturbed to be suitable for representative laboratory
strength testing. However, empirical correlations have been proposed between N-val-
ues and the compressibility of chalk, and widely applied in foundation design. Rela-
tionships have been published between the strength of clays and N-values. The au-
thor considers such relationships as but very approximate and does not recommend
their use.
Static Cone Penetrometer
All static cone penetrometer tests consist of pushing a pointed rod into the ground
and measuring resistance to progress. The stronger the ground the greater is its the
resistance to progress. A large variety of static penetrometers exist but that most widely
used and with which engineers have the greatest experience was developed in the
Netherlands.
The test was designed to enable a cheap and rapid assessment to be made of the
length and diameter of piles necessary to carry a given load. If a pointed rod is pushed
into the ground the resistance to penetration will come from resistance to the point
and side friction resistance to the passage of the rods. As the point is pushed deeper
into the ground the side friction component of resistance will continuously increase.
To determine the resistance of each layer to cone penetration some way has to be found
to distinguish side friction from point resistance. In the mechanical types of cone
penetrometer the end cone is connected to the surface by a rod passing within the outer
rods. The penetrometer machine hydraulically or mechanically pushes rods and cone
into the ground; resistance to progress is measured by a hydraulic or electrical load
cell. The apparatus may be used in various ways. One of the simplest is to push the
combined outer rods and cone into the ground for a short distance, say 0.2 m. The cone
alone is then advanced by pushing on the inner rod for an equal distance, again mea-
suring the resistance. The outer tube is advanced to meet the cone and both pushed
forward for another short penetration. The results are plotted on a depth/resistance
to penetration graph, in which side friction and cone resistance are plotted (Fig. 6.1c).
The general measurement of side friction is useful but it is much better if both lo-
cal side friction and cone resistance can be measured for any depth, for knowledge of
164 CHAPTER 6 · Field Tests and Measurements
both parameters may serve to identify soil type. This can readily be done using the
electric friction (Fig. 6.1d) cone penetrometer. In this strain gauges are mounted in
the cone and a short friction sleeve section (the friction jacket) behind it so that both
side friction (f) and cone resistance (c) are continually recorded during penetration.
The friction ratio,
(6.1)
may be plotted against cone resistance to give an indication of the nature of the soils
being penetrated. In general clays have high friction ratios while sands and gravels
have low friction ratios.
The test is standardised with regard to apparatus and procedure, the most impor-
tant recommendations being that:
(cid:1) the cone apex angle must be 60°;
(cid:1) the cone cross-sectional area should be 100 mm2;
(cid:1) the friction jacket area should be 15000 mm2;
(cid:1) the rate of penetration of the cone should be 20 mms–1;
(cid:1) force measurements should be accurate to within 5%.
The cone penetration test is best suited to soft soils in which tests to depths of the
order of 50 m may be undertaken. Sufficient force can not be generated to penetrate
through very dense granular soils or hard clays and clearly the test is unsuitable to
penetrate coarsely granular deposits or clays with boulders. This implies that the test
can be used only in areas for which the geology is reasonably well known; it is not a
tool for primary investigation on sites of unknown geology.
The various parameters derived may be applied to foundation engineering, par-
ticularly with regard to piled foundations. This is done via empirical formulae and
much depends upon experience.
Both foundation engineers working using SPT values and foundation engineers
working using static cone penetrometer results have developed foundation design
formulae incorporating values derived from one or the other of the two tests. In gen-
eral the formulae using cone penetrometer results appear rather more elegant, par-
ticularly with regard to the calculation of settlements. Accordingly some effort has been
put into attempting to correlate SPT-N-values with cone penetrometer results. Some
correlations are given in Table 6.1. These correlations can only be regarded as approxi-
mate.
In the author’s opinion the cone penetrometer is a test giving results which are much
superior to the SPT for they are continuous rather than intermittent (thus allowing
the exact location of boundaries between layers of different properties) and the foun-
dation design procedures which can be undertaken with cone resistance values are
much superior to those possible with SPT results. It would be better to regard the
SPT as a first step exploration tool and the static cone penetrometer as an in situ
test.

Strength and Deformation Tests
Two commonly used tests of this type are the vane test and the pressuremeter test.
The Vane Test
In this test a cruciform vane at the end of a solid drill rod is forced into the soil at the
bottom of a borehole (generally a shell and auger hole) and then rotated until the
torque on the vane causes the soil to fail in shear. The test is usually undertaken in
clays that are too soft or too sensitive to allow recovery of satisfactory tube samples.
The apparatus commonly used will shear clays up to about 100 kPa shear strength.
The bottom of the borehole must be thoroughly cleaned out before inserting the vane
to ensure that the test is in undisturbed ground. Smaller hand vanes are available for
use in the sides of trial pits and vane equipment is also available for laboratory use.
The shear strength of the clay may be calculated if the torque (T) at the point of
failure is measured when:
(6.2)
where; h=length of the vane (m), d=diameter of the vane (m), c=undrained shear
strength of the soil (Nm–2), (assuming ϕ=0).
In the formula the first term relates to the shear strength of the soil on the vertical
sides of the vane and the second term to the shear strength of the circular discs of soil
at both ends of the vane.
While the hand vane is in quite common use as a rough guide to soil strength when
examining trial pits and the laboratory vane is useful in examining samples, the field
vane is now seldom used because the results do not justify the time and effort required
to set up the apparatus and undertake the tests. The static cone penetrometer is of
much greater value for soft soils.
166 CHAPTER 6 · Field Tests and Measurements
Pressuremeter Tests
Pressuremeters are cylindrical cells that expand, put pressure on the sides of the bore-
hole and cause the borehole to deform. All types of pressuremeter incorporate instru-
mentation to measure borehole deformation and cell pressure so that a stress/strain
graph may be drawn. Study of this graph allows assessment of the deformation
behaviour of the volume of ground stressed by the cell. In soils it is possible to apply
sufficient pressure to shear the ground. This is seldom possible in fresh rock so that
pressuremeters in rock mostly measure deformation characteristics up to a particu-
lar stress level.
Pressuremeters may operate by the all-round expansion of a rubber cylinder or by
the opening of a split cylinder. Pressure is generated hydraulically. Borehole dilation
is measured by diametrical electrical transducers or by volume displacement.
Menard Test
The Menard pressuremeter is the best known type of pressuremeter for use in soils. It
consists of two main components; a Probe and a Pressure-Volume meter.
The ‘Probe’ is the cell that fits in the borehole and consists of a steel cylinder with
rubber membranes stretched over it so as to form three independent cells (Fig. 6.1e).
The central measuring cell contains a liquid under gas pressure while the top and
bottom ‘guard’ cells are pressurised by gas only. Volume deformation of the borehole
is measured only in the central cell adjacent to which conditions of uniform stress are
considered to exist. The rubber membranes are protected by thin steel strips to pre-
vent their being punctured by sharp stones. The cells are made to fit standard bore-
hole sizes, such as AX, BX etc.
The action of the probe in the borehole is governed by the ‘Pressure Volumeter’ at
the surface. This allows water under pressure to be pumped into the central cell and
gas into the guard cells. The water is pressurised by carbon dioxide gas brought on
site in compressed gas bottles. The pressure volumeter is connected to the cell by tubes
through which water and gas pass. The system contains a known amount of water. As
the borehole deforms the cell expands, taking in more water and the water level in a
‘sight tube’ at the surface correspondingly alters thus providing an assessment of the
volumetric deformation of the borehole. Pressure is usually applied in increments and
the corresponding volume changes noted. A typical pressure/volumetric deformation
curve is given in (Fig. 6.1f).
The curve generally shows three sections. The first part of the curve shows quite
large volumetric deformation for limited pressure and represents the recompression
of the relaxed soil around the borehole. The second straight line part represents ‘elas-
tic’ deformation of the soil. The third section shows increasing volumetric deforma-
tion for equal increments of pressure and represents plastic deformation leading to
shear failure. This may reach the ‘limit pressure’ at which the soil is deemed to have
failed. The pressuremeter is capable of applying pressures of the order of 100 kPa.
Generally the pressuremeter is used in boreholes that will stand without casing. If
the borehole shows a slight tendency to collapse support may be given by drilling mud.
In granular soils the pressuremeter may be used within special slotted casing which is
strong enough to support the borehole yet sufficiently flexible to deform significantly
6.2 · Tests in Boreholes 167
under the loads that the pressuremeter can apply. Results must be corrected to allow
for the influence of the casing.
The results obtained may be used to assess bearing capacity and settlement char-
acteristics of the soil.
The results may be influenced by the disturbance of the ground during boring. To
overcome this Menard has developed a pressuremeter which may be wash bored into
place. A self-boring pressuremeter, the ‘Camkometer’ has also been developed. Because
the device bores itself into place the soil tested can be held not to have been stress
relieved so that soil load on the cell is equal to the in situ stress.
Pressuremeter testing in rock requires the generation of much larger pressures on
the sides of the borehole if significant deformation is to be measured. Pressuremeters
for work in rock thus tend to be more robust than those in soil, will expand less and
have much more delicate instrumentation to measure very small diametrical displace-
ments.
Dilatometer Test
The ‘dilatometer’ devised by the National Laboratory for Civil Engineering in Lisbon
(LNEC) is an example of the above. This consists of a steel cylinder 66 mm in diam-
eter wrapped in a rubber jacket 4 mm thick. This gives an overall diameter of 72 mm
which gives a 2 mm annulus around the cell in a 76 mm diameter borehole (NX size).
Oil is pumped under pressure between the steel cylinder and the rubber membrane;
deformation is measured by four differential transformers set 32 mm apart in the cen-
tre of the 540 mm long load unit which itself lies in the 755 mm long cell. Pressures up
to about 15 MPa may be applied to the rock.
Other types of pressuremeter exist. Their pressure/deformation curves are similar
to that shown in Fig. 6.1f, except that in a test in rock the first part of the pressure/
deformation curve reflects the recovery of borehole relaxation while further load may
serve to close any discontinuities which may be open within the stress field imposed
by the cell. Further application of load will reflect the deformation of ‘intact’ rock. In
the second phase of loading rock above the cell may fall into the hole and jam above
the cell. Unless the cell can be closed back to its original size it may be difficult to with-
draw from the borehole.
6.2.3
Permeability Tests
Values of mass permeability are required to calculate flow of water into excavations,
into tunnels, under dams and from reservoirs. Mass permeability (k) is defined by:
(6.3)
where k is in units of velocity (ms–1) and measured in the direction of flow, A is the
area at 90° to the macroscopic direction of flow and i is the hydraulic gradient associ-
ated with that flow.
168 CHAPTER 6 · Field Tests and Measurements
Pumping Tests
Assessments of permeability can be made from well pumping tests (Fig. 6.3a). Pump-
ing tests are not undertaken lightly for they are tests which take days to perform, re-
quire the installation of submersible pumps, observations of the fall of the water lev-
els around the well, made with the help of observation wells, and arrangements to dis-
pose of large quantities of water! Such tests are thus lengthy and expensive. Having
established a “stable” water surface, with a uniform pumping rate, the permeability of
the unconfined aquifer shown in Fig. 6.3a is given by
Fig. 6.3. Types of test to establish mass permeability
6.2 · Tests in Boreholes 169
(6.4)
Simpler tests can be undertaken in boreholes (Fig. 6.3b). Two kinds of test are pos-
sible; ‘pumping out’ tests, in which the groundwater table is lowered by pumping and
the rate of restoration of the water table back to its original level is observed, and ‘pump-
ing in’ tests in which water is pumped into the borehole and the water intake is mea-
sured. As an alternative to this last procedure the water head may be raised and its
rate of fall back to the original level may be observed. This is the ‘falling head’ test.
To undertake this test the section, whose permeability is to be known, is penetrated
by a borehole. Sections above are isolated by casing and the test section is filled with a
coarse gravel filter material to support the sides of the hole. The location of the natu-
ral groundwater table is carefully observed during boring. The simplest routine is to
raise the water table by an initial head H which is then allowed to dissipate. The wa-
0
ter falling to various levels of H are measured against time using an electric water level
meter. The permeability is determined as;
(6.5)
where A=cross-sectional area of the borehole at the water table level, F=dimension-
less intake factor relating to the geometry of the test, and T=basic time lag. T is de-
termined by plotting the ratio H/H against t (time elapsed in the test to any reading
0
of H). In the beginning of the test t=0 when H/H =1.
0
In the constant head pumping in test water is added and kept at a constant level.
The amount of water added will initially be large but will eventually reach a constant
value, Q. The calculation of the permeability depends upon the relationship of the test
section to the water table, but when the test section lies below the natural water table
level the equation determining k will be of the from:
(6.6)
where Q=the rate of flow, H =the constant head and F is a dimensionless factor ob-
0
tained from charts.
Packer Tests
The tests described above are mostly undertaken in soils or weak rock. Permeabilities
of rock are often required in order to assess leakage under dams or to estimate grout
take and test pressures similar to actual expected pressures cannot be achieved by the
methods described above. Accordingly in rock ‘packer tests’ are undertaken in which
a section of a borehole in rock is sealed off by packers above and below the test sec-
tion (the double packer test, Fig. 6.3c) or by one packer at some level above the bot-
170 CHAPTER 6 · Field Tests and Measurements
tom of the borehole ‘the single packer’ test). The ‘packer’ is a rubber seal, usually about
5 times as long as the diameter of the borehole, inflated by compressed air. Boreholes
are mostly rotary core drilled.
Water is pumped into the test section under pressure until the water inflow Q is
steady. Then permeability is given by the formula:
(6.7)
for A≥10r; where A=length of the test section, r=radius of the borehole and
Q=steady quantity of flow under a pressure head H; this is not necessarily that pres-
sure recorded by surface pressure gauges for there will be pressure losses due to fric-
tion in the pipes (usually drill rods) conducting water to the test section.
Usually three pressures are applied for one measurement of k. Results are usually
given in ms–1 but sometimes in ‘Lugeon units’. A rock mass is said to have a perme-
ability of one Lugeon if under a pressure head of 100 m of water above groundwater
level a 1 m length of NX size borehole accepts 1 litre of water a minute. It is very diffi-
cult to convert standard permeability units to Lugeon units because the Lugeon test (a
type of packer test) is standardised. An equivalence of 1 Lugeon≈10–7 ms–1 is some-
times applied.
Packer tests are not easy to undertake because of the difficulty of isolating the test
section in the borehole. If the packer seal is not tight leakage will give a higher water
take and false values of permeability. Similarly leaks from drill rod connections, hose
connections etc. can also lead to major errors. No one can be quite certain about what
is happening in the borehole; Fig. 6.3d. shows how locally open joints around test sec-
tions may allow free passage of the water from out of the test section and give results
which do not reflect the general permeability of the rock mass. Accordingly many tests
are needed to achieve a reasonable value of permeability and it is sometimes thought
better to quote permeabilities to the nearest order of magnitude or perhaps to the
nearest whole number times the order of magnitude.
Meaning of Results
It should be noted that permeability formulae depend for their application on the as-
sumption that the strata tested are homogeneous and isotropic. However, it is well
known that in bedded strata there may be a considerable difference between
permeabilities along the layers and permeabilities across the layers. In rocks one par-
ticular joint set in a joint pattern may be open and the others closed so that maximum
values of permeability will be in a particular direction related to geological structure.
These factors cast doubts as to the validity of using pumping tests to obtain general
values for permeability; they are essentially well-tests designed to supply hydraulic
parameters (Transmissivity and Storage) suitable for predicting drawdown for a given
discharge at that well. These restrictions should be taken into account in both plan-
ning a programme of permeability tests and also in assessing the value of the results
obtained from the test programme.
6.2 · Tests in Boreholes 171
Permeability measurements may serve as a guide to rock quality in a uniform rock
material whose quality depends upon weathering and joint frequency.
The text given above is intended to give the general idea of permeability testing.
There are clearly many possible relationships between test sections, groundwater lev-
els, aquicludes and aquifers. Solutions to many possible situations have been formu-
lated. Reference may be made to publications such as the ‘Earth Manual’ published by
the U.S. Department of the Interior and British Standard 5930 (1999) for further details.
It must be emphasized that in order to get reliable assessments of permeability there
must be accurate knowledge of the positions of water tables and the boundaries of
aquifers and aquicludes. This means that permeability tests are best undertaken in
boreholes sunk specially for these tests after earlier borings have established geology
and groundwater conditions.
6.2.4
Measurements of In Situ Stress
The stresses that exist in the ground before the construction of an engineering work
are referred to as the initial (or virgin) in situ stresses. These stresses are the result of
the weight of overlying strata, residual stresses related to the geological history of the
ground mass and the present-day tectonic stress vector.
Most in situ stress measurements are undertaken in rock and involve fixing a strain
measuring device in a borehole and over-coring the device which then records strains
opposite to the stresses existing in situ (Fig. 6.4). The device has mostly to be calibrated
in the laboratory in a block of rock taken from the test site.
Stress may be measured two dimensionally by fastening a strain measuring device
at the bottom of a borehole and then over-coring (Fig. 6.4a). Devices include photo-
elastic strain gauges, photo-elastic glass plugs and electrical strain gauge rosettes. Of
this last type the Leeman ‘doorstopper’ cell has been widely used and measures biaxial
stress in one plane. The Leeman triaxial cell glues three strain gauge rosettes to the

measure in situ stress
172 CHAPTER 6 · Field Tests and Measurements
sides of a borehole (Fig. 6.4b) and the strains recorded after stress relief may be inter-
preted to give the triaxial state of in situ stress.
Measurements of stress in one direction may be made using a flat jack (Fig.6.5). In
this the distances between measuring points on a rock surface are recorded. A slot is
excavated between the points by saw cut or by overlapping drill holes. The previously
existing stresses will be relieved as the rock moves into the slot. A flat jack is cemented
into the slot and pumped up until the points return to their original position. Jack
pressure is then equal to in the situ stress normal to the slot.
None of the techniques described above are easy to undertake and require specialised
equipment and experience. Many observations are necessary to give confidence that
the in situ stress has been measured with reasonable accuracy with regard to both
magnitude and direction. Particular problems are that the in situ stress field is altered
by the excavation which gives access to the test site, so that the stresses recorded may
not be the original in situ stresses. In fractured rock with open discontinuities the stress
field measurement on the scale of the stress meter may not be representative of the
overall stress pattern. If the rock has anisotropic elastic properties it may be very dif-
ficult to calibrate the stress measuring device.
6.3
Tests in Large Diameter Boreholes, Shafts and Tunnels
These tests are undertaken to determine deformation and strength characteristics of
the ground mass. The ‘sample’ tested is in situ and contains discontinuities. If useful
results are to be obtained the pressure put upon the sample must significantly exceed
the working pressure to be imposed by the proposed civil engineering work. One of

the principal difficulties of large scale testing is to arrange for the reaction against
which loading systems may push in order to subject the sample to pressure. Another
difficulty is that the sample to be tested may be well below surface and has to be reached
by shaft, large diameter borehole or exploratory tunnel. There may be water seepages
at the test location while cramped working conditions may make it difficult to set up
the test equipment satisfactorily.
A further problem is to be able to define the shape and the nature of the sample
that has been tested. The results of many well-undertaken in situ tests have been spoiled
for lack of a good description of the sample. The volume of ground tested should be
dug out after each test and material and mass characteristics described. The most
commonly used type of large scale load test is the plate bearing test.
6.3.1
Plate Bearing Test
The test consists of loading a rigid circular or, less commonly, a square plate and mea-
suring the penetration of the plate into the ground. Plates may vary in diameter from
about 0.3 m to about 2 m. In general the smaller sizes are used on soils and the larger
on rocks. In rocks larger plates are preferred in the hope that the volume of rock tested
will contain a representative sample of the discontinuity pattern in the rock mass.
The smaller size tests are often conducted at the bottom of large diameter bore-
holes, so that the plate is connected to the surface by a load carrying column. The
bottom of the borehole must be very carefully cleaned out to ensure that the plate bears
on to undisturbed ground. Some type of ‘filler’ material, generally cement mortar or
plaster, is placed carefully at the bottom of the borehole to ensure the even transfer of
load to the ground. Reaction may be given by a mass of kentledge (iron billets or con-
crete blocks) erected on a frame whose load bearing legs lie well away from the hole
(Fig. 6.6a). Tests on large diameter plates may require hundreds of tonnes of kentledge
to give the required test pressures. It has sometimes been found economic to jack
against a cross beam between two tension piles or ground anchorages, but the beam
must be long (and therefore massive) to assure that the stress field around the piles or
anchorages does not influence the zone around the plate. A hydraulic jack between
the column and the kentledge is pumped up to press the plate into the ground. Plate
deflection is measured by dial gauges in contact with the top of a measuring rod lead-
ing from the plate up through the load carrying column.
The test is undertaken by applying increments of load and observing the subse-
quent plate settlements. Alternatively in soils the test to determine soil maximum bear-
ing capacity may be conducted at a constant rate of penetration, rates being of the order
of 2.5 mmmin–1. BS1377 (1990) suggests that the maximum bearing capacity may be
considered to be the bearing pressure applied to achieve a settlement of 15% of the
plate diameter.
If the test load is applied in increments then it is common practice to wait until
settlement from the application of one increment is complete (or substantially com-
plete) before applying the next increment. Cycles of loading and unloading may be
undertaken in the course of the test in order to assess how much settlement is irre-
versible and how much ‘elastic’. The magnitude of the load to be applied in each in-
crement, the rate of application of that load, the need to undertake cyclic loading and
174 CHAPTER 6 · Field Tests and Measurements
Fig. 6.6. Plate and in situ shear tests
6.3 · Tests in Large Diameter Boreholes, Shafts and Tunnels 175
so forth, depend upon the nature of the project for which the test is being undertaken
and the nature of the materials being tested. It is very expensive to undertake plate
bearing tests and each one must be carefully planned to get the data required. The
tests, which require continuous supervision, may take days to perform but time spent
undertaking the test is often a relatively small investment in comparison with the cost
of setting the test up.
In uniformly weathered rock the objective is to find the depth of the weathered layer
which has deformation characteristics adequate enough to fulfil construction crite-
ria. This means multiple plate bearing tests which may be achieved if the reaction to
plate load is given by a cable anchorage anchored at some considerable depth below
the shallowest test level (Fig. 6.6b). Having executed one test the excavation may be
deepened to below the level of the sample significantly affected by the previous test
and the test repeated.
Tests on rock may be conducted in tunnels. In such cases the roof of the tunnel may
provide the reaction to the load given by the jack (Fig. 6.6c). Tests may be also under-
taken across the diameter of a vertical shaft or horizontally across tunnels (Fig. 6.6d).
Preparation of the bearing surface is much easier in such conditions. If the rock can
be easily cut then smaller scale tests can be undertaken in niches hacked out of a tun-
nel wall. These can be orientated to load in any required direction.
The volume of sample affected by the test depends on the size of the plate and as
can be seen from Fig. 6.6, in which approximate bulb of stress dimensions are shown,
this is small relative to the size of most foundation widths. In soil and rock masses
which contain discontinuities whose presence will significantly affect their behaviour
as a foundation medium this means that the test sample includes significantly fewer
discontinuities than the mass to be loaded by the foundation so that the test result
can be considered to be only a guide to foundation medium characteristics.
Stagg and Zienkiewicz (1968) approached the problem of providing reaction for
the applied load by using a cable anchorage passing through the centre of the plate
and used multiple plates to expand the volume of ground loaded. In their tests four
concrete loading pads were cast on to the surface of the rock mass. The principle of
this approach is shown in Fig. 6.6e. Cable anchorages were installed in 12 m deep bore-
holes so that at least 4.5 m of cable was free above the grouted anchor cable. Vertical loads
were applied by three 100 ton hydraulic jacks on each pad; the safe working load of
the cables was of the order of 275 tonnes. In order to be able to assess horizontal moduli
of deformation one pair of loading pads was linked together by bars to allow them to
be pulled together by two hollow jacks, while the other two pads could be pushed apart
by a jack. Stagg and Zienkiewicz concluded that this reaction system gave satisfactory
results provided that the top of the anchorage was 6 to 8 times the diameter of the pad
below the base of the pad and that the ratio of plate diameter to hole diameter could
readily be made sufficiently large to justify ignoring the possible effects of the hole on
the test results; in their tests the pad diameter was eight times the borehole diameter.
The advantages of using cable anchorages as reaction are that they can be installed
in any direction, so that moduli may be determined in the direction of stress applied
by an engineering work.
If the free cable above the anchorage is made long enough tests may be undertaken at
various levels in a weathered rock profile by deepening the access shaft around the cable.
176 CHAPTER 6 · Field Tests and Measurements
Installation of the cable requires drilling a deep hole below the test location from
which cores may be taken and tested. In situ pressuremeter tests may also be done in
the borehole before anchor installation and examination of the cores should lead to
be best choice of test levels.
Modulus values from the plate bearing test may be calculated from the formula:
(6.8)
where E=elastic modulus; q=pressure applied to the plate; S=average settlement
of the plate; B=plate diameter and v=Poisson’s ratio (usually assumed to be between
0.10 (hard rock) and 0.25 (soft rock).
For tests conducted at the bottom of a borehole the formula becomes
(6.9)
where I is a depth correction factor (Table 6.2).

6.3.2
In Situ Shear Tests
It may be desirable to undertake shear tests on large samples in situ if the scale of labo-
ratory tests is too small to give reliable values of shear strength. Such tests may be
undertaken on soils or soft rocks in situ but the most common application is to deter-
mine the shear strength of discontinuities in rock in connection with the imposition
of inclined loads by dams. The investigation of most dams includes the excavation of
trial adits and the shear test may then use roof and walls of the tunnel for reaction to
jacking (Fig. 6.6f). Samples have to be cut out of the rock mass so that the discontinu-
ity to be tested falls on the plane of shearing. Samples may be from about 0.5 to 1.5 m
square and are clad with reinforced concrete above the shear plane in order to dis-
tribute normal and shear loads without damaging the sample. Only peak and residual
strengths under one normal load can be determined. Cable anchorages, passing
through the centre of the block, may be used as reaction to apply the normal force.

boreholes (for v=0.25)
6.4 · Measurements in Boreholes and Excavations 177
The reader will note that in Fig. 6.6f the shear force is directed slightly downwards
rather than horizontally. The reason for this is that if the shearing jack is horizontal,
the spread of shear stress through the sample is not uniform and failure, that is the
splitting of the sample along the discontinuity, may begin first near to the jack apply-
ing shear stress, and then proceed away from it. This may cause the sample to ‘ride’
upwards near the shear jack, with consequent complications to the test results. The
application of a slightly downwards shear load may be held to overcome this, but in-
troduces the complication of having to resolve the shearing force into horizontal and
vertical components.
6.3.3
Other Tests
The largest scale test that is commonly undertaken is the pressure tunnel test. In this
a section of tunnel is sealed off and subjected to internal hydraulic pressure. Diametri-
cally placed extensometers measure tunnel diameter extensions. The modulus of de-
formation may be calculated using the expression:
(6.10)
where E=modulus of deformation; d=internal diameter of tunnel; p=internal pres-
sure; v=Poisson’s ratio; δ=diametrical strain at centre of loaded length and
ψ=coefficient depending on ratio of tunnel diameter to loaded length (ψ=1 if loaded
length>2×tunnel diameter).
6.4
Measurements in Boreholes and Excavations
Various types of instrument at the site investigation stage may also be used during
and after construction for the measurement of certain geotechnical parameters, for
example, pore water pressure. Continuous measurement from before construction,
during construction and after construction, constitutes monitoring of the measured
parameters.
Typical examples include monitoring of trial embankments to optimise design, use
in projects under construction to provide information upon which to base design
changes or to confirm design assumptions, and use in completed structures to moni-
tor performance.
The fundamental requirement for any instrument is that it must be capable of
measuring the required parameter, without the very fact of its physical presence caus-
ing alteration to that parameter. It must also be sufficiently robust to withstand a cer-
tain amount of damage which could easily be sustained on a construction site and still
perform satisfactorily for the lifetime of the engineering structure. Much instrumen-
tation now in common use has not been in existence long enough to know whether or
not it can fulfil all of these requirements, particularly with regard to very long-term
performance. With the present advances in micro-electronics and computerised sys-
178 CHAPTER 6 · Field Tests and Measurements
tems it is probably true to say that there is nothing that cannot be measured continu-
ally and with great accuracy. If the equipment does not presently exist it could be de-
veloped, providing that there is sufficient economic incentive for the developer. Great ad-
vances in instrumentation may be expected in the coming years. For this reason this sec-
tion restricts itself to the description of fundamental instrumentation and principles.
A few broad categories of instruments which have been in use for many years can
be distinguished:
(cid:1) Standpipes and Piezometers: to measure groundwater levels and pore water pressure
(cid:1) Extensometers: to measure small changes in length
(cid:1) Inclinometers: to measure changes in slope or angle
(cid:1) Settlement gauges: to measure settlement under structures
(cid:1) Pressure cells: to measure total loads on buried structures
6.4.1
Standpipes and Piezometers
Standpipes
The standpipe (Fig. 6.7a) consists of a perforated or slotted plastic pipe inserted into
a borehole with suitable granular packing or filter material to prevent fine grains of
soil from blocking the pipe openings. Water level is measured by a dip meter, which
usually consists of twin electric cable connected to a battery and some device, visual
or audible, such as a light or bell, to record the closure of the circuit when the tip touches
the water.
The diameter of the pipe is not critical, but is usually in the range 20 to 50 mm. The
system is simple and cheap, but there are two major disadvantages. Firstly, the standpipe
can measure only a simple groundwater regime and could not measure pore pressures
in different strata because the borehole and granular filter will produce hydraulic con-
tinuity between strata. Such a regime may not have existed prior to the drilling of the
borehole, and the existence of strata with different pore pressures might very well be
the critical geotechnical factor which could cause alteration to some fundamental de-
sign parameter. Secondly, the response time is often long, especially in low permeability
soils.
The first disadvantage may be overcome by using a piezometer: standpipes are used
to locate the water table. The second disadvantage is reduced by using a small diam-
eter pipe so that the piezometer will respond to a lower volume of water flowing into
the system.
Piezometers
There are many different types of piezometer; the appropriate type is selected accord-
ing to the circumstances and the requirement. All types measure groundwater pres-
sure but they differ in other respects, of which perhaps the most important is “response
time”. This is the time taken for any change in water level to be registered by the in-
strument. The time taken for water to flow from the soil to the piezometer is deter-
mined by the hydraulic conductivity (permeability) of the soil. Some types of piezom-
6.4 · Measurements in Boreholes and Excavations 179
Fig. 6.7. Monitoring devices
180 CHAPTER 6 · Field Tests and Measurements
eter respond quickly to small volumes of water flow produced by a change in pres-
sure, while other types require a larger volume to produce a response.A simple piezom-
eter is the Casagrande design, using either a perforated pipe or a ceramic or plastic porous
pot (Fig. 6.7b). Some types of pot are protected by a steel guard, and are suitable for
driving direct into the ground to depths of less than 10 m, provided that they are con-
nected to steel piping. The porous pot has a pore size of about 50 to 60 micrometers
and is connected to the ground surface by means of 10 mm diameter plastic pipe or
tube, which is protected by a lining pipe or casing. Pressures may be read by dip meter,
or by pressure gauge.
These open piezometers are simple, cheap, and effective, provided that they are
carefully installed and that their limitations are known and respected. However, there
are circumstances where remote reading and/or rapid response is essential, for ex-
ample, where it is necessary to monitor change in pore water pressure under condi-
tions of rapid loading. Such may be the case where rolled clay is being placed for the
core of an earth dam, or where the earth dam is being filled for the first time. For such
circumstances, a closed piezometer system is required.
Closed Piezometer Systems
The essence of a closed piezometer system is that water pressure changes in the regis-
tering device can be read at some distance from it. An example of this type is the pneu-
matic piezometer (Fig. 6.7c). This may sometimes be preferred in situations where,
for example, freezing of water in hydraulic piezometer tubes becomes a major hazard,
despite the use of anti-freeze mixtures. There are other advantages, including fast re-
sponse time, low cost, no need to make height corrections, and terminal panels may
be housed in protected boxes rather than expensive gauge houses. A single, portable
readout unit may be used for all readings. Disadvantages include the inability to mea-
sure negative pore pressures because the system cannot be de-aired. They should there-
fore be used only below the water table, which makes them unsuitable for many earth-
fill applications.
The operating principle is that of a pneumatic pressure cell. The porous tip houses
an air activated pressure cell and is connected by twin nylon tubes to apparatus at the
surface. One tube (outlet) connects to a flow indicator, and the other (inlet) to a pres-
sure measuring device and compressed gas bottle. Gas, usually nitrogen or air, is fed
into the inlet and down to the tip, but cannot flow direct into the outlet because of a
diaphragm which is held fast against the tube ports by the water pressure in the tip.
When the gas pressure exceeds the water pressure, the diaphragm is forced away from
the ports, and gas enters the outlet tube and produces measurable reaction in the flow
indicator. When the gas and water pressures are balanced, no gas bubbles will register
in the flow indicator and the water pressure can then be recorded.
6.4.2
Extensometers
The simplest type of “extensometer” is a tape measure, which can measure relative
movements between structural members, such as parts of tunnel linings and sides of
excavations.
6.4 · Measurements in Boreholes and Excavations 181
To establish the fact that some differential movement is taking place across a joint,
fracture or similar specific location, a simple glass “tell-tale” is adequate. Often a mi-
croscope slide is used for this purpose, and is cemented across the fracture. If move-
ment takes place, the glass will break. It is not possible to determine the amount of
movement, only to establish the fact that movement has taken place.
Extensometers measure differential movement. To measure movement of structure,
for example, it is necessary to examine movement of the structure relative to the sur-
roundings. Fixed points are established on the structure, and these are monitored by
accurate surveying techniques from some distance away. The simplest type of bore-
hole extensometer is nothing more than a metal wire or tape anchored to the bottom
of a borehole with a device to measure tape extension or shortening at the surface
(Fig. 6.7d). The relative movement between two points may be measured by the rod
extensometer, which can be installed horizontally, vertically, for example in a bore-
hole or at any angle (Fig. 6.7e). The use of such extensometers in subsidence prob-
lems is explained in Chap. 13. They are reliable and simple, but require correction for
temperature changes.
There are many different models, but the principle depends upon fixing the rod
and surrounding sleeve at one end and measuring movement at the other. The move-
ment may be read by dial gauge, or remotely by electronic methods. Several extensometer
rods and sleeves may be installed together, to give relative movements between differ-
ent sections. Such instruments may be used for measuring relative movements on slopes,
in tunnels, foundations, retaining walls, or in soils and rocks stressed by anchors or
affected by excavation or other works. They are reliable and accurate, movements of up to
50 mm being recorded to an accuracy of perhaps 0.01 mm. The rods may be up to 100 m
in length, although with such very long rods accuracy will be much less.
6.4.3
Inclinometers
Inclinometers are used to measure horizontal movements at various levels, usually
within earth fills, and may be used to monitor slopes to give an indication of move-
ment within the slope before it becomes visible at the surface. In earth fills, they are
often used in conjunction with the magnet settlement gauge. Inclinometers have of-
ten been very successful in identifying movement zones and measuring direction,
magnitude and rate of movement in both slopes and embankments. A very simple form
of inclinometer for registering the location of zones of movement is shown in Fig. 6.7f.
This is no more than a borehole with a plastic pipe grouted into it down which a simple
close-fitting cylindrical weight may slide. If the strata move and bend the borehole
the weight will not slide past the bend, thus detecting the upper level of the plane of
movement (in Fig. 6.7f for clarity the borehole is shown as sheared).
This simple detector can be made much more complex and there are a number of
different types, and within each type there are variations produced by different manu-
facturers. However, the basic principle is the same. A guide tube is installed in a bore-
hole or fixed to a structure, and the inclination of the guide tube from the vertical
measured at pre- determined intervals by means of a pendulum enclosed in a water-
tight probe which is lowered through the tube. The tilt of the pendulum is measured
by electronic devices.
182 CHAPTER 6 · Field Tests and Measurements
6.4.4
Settlement Gauges
The simplest way to measure settlement of either the ground or placed fill is to grout
a reference rod into a block of concrete and measure vertical movement by conven-
tional surveying techniques. This is expensive in terms of manpower but remote read-
ing, multiple point systems have been developed and are now in general use. Some of
these are similar in most respects to vertically installed extensometers.
6.4.5
Pressure Cells
Pressure cells are used to measure the loads beneath foundations, loads on piles,
tensions in ground anchors, loads on the sides of lined and unlined tunnels, pres-
sures within earth fill structures and so on. As such, some types may be described
as load cells. There are many different types, most electronic, but liquid pressure
cells record pressure on the sides of a flexible box which consists essentially of two
flat steel plates, which is transferred by means of contained liquid to a measuring
device. Liquid pressure forces the diaphragm against an outlet tube until gas or
liquid is pumped under pressure to force the diaphragm back. When the pressure
of the liquid on one side is equalled by the gas or liquid pressure on the other, liquid
will just flow to the pressure gauge. In this way, the pressure inside the pressure
cell can be determined. The principle is clearly similar to that of the pneumatic
piezometer.
6.5
Engineering Geophysics
Site investigation techniques may be divided into two categories, destructive and non-
destructive. Destructive techniques are those which, in their execution, in some way
change the nature of the ground they are investigating. Thus, for example, plate bear-
ing tests at the bottom of a shaft test ground influenced by the excavation of the shaft
rather than undisturbed ground. Non-destructive techniques examine the ground
without permanently altering its characteristics and are generally of either an obser-
vational or a geophysical nature.
Geophysical techniques fall into two main streams. In the first, naturally occurring
phenomena, such as gravity, the earth’s magnetism or telluric currents are measured
with great accuracy, for values anomalous within general trends will reflect local geo-
logical conditions. In the second stream fall methods in which some form of signal is
passed into the ground and changes or responses to this signal, resulting from geo-
logical conditions, are observed. Seismic and geo-electric techniques are the best
known of this group.
Geological structures or anomalies are detectible because different types of ground
materials have different physical properties such as density, elasticity, conductivity etc.
Geophysical methods detect differences in these properties which may also coincide
with other geological boundaries. The first and ‘traditional’ use of geophysics was to
6.5 · Engineering Geophysics 183
locate boundaries. These techniques are now quite well known and are continually
improving. In the shallow depth geophysics utilised in the investigations for engineer-
ing projects the accuracy of location of boundaries is usually somewhat less than that
desired for design purposes. However it is often rather more important to know the
shape of a boundary than its exact depth. Figure 6.8 gives a simple example.
Two boreholes in Fig. 6.8a show soil over weathered rock over fresh rock. Rockhead
would appear to be relatively level between the two boreholes. After a seismic refrac-
tion survey on a line joining the two boreholes together the rockhead is seen to be in
the form of a buried valley. The depth of rockhead found by the geophysics is not that
as found in the boreholes, probably because the velocity of the upper weathered rock
is much the same as that of the overlying soil. Depths to rockhead are thus not accu-
rate but the shape of the boundary between soil and rock is indicated.
If geophysical anomalies caused by material properties allow the definition of geo-
logical bodies then it would seem possible to establish material or mass properties by
studying the geophysical characteristics of known and defined geological bodies. Thus,
some 30 years ago work was begun relating the excavatability of rock to the velocity
of shock waves through that rock. Attempts have been and are being made to relate
ground mass deformability to shock wave parameters.
While the experience of particular engineers has lead them to enthusiasm for one
of the techniques or to distrust them all, many engineers are beginning to realise that
each geophysical method is but an investigation tool, which, if properly applied, will
give data. The interpretation of this data may be difficult and the accuracy of the re-
sults obtained may be limited, depending on the complexity of the geological situa-
tion, the quality of the data, the skill of the interpreter and the sophistication of the
interpretative techniques used. However, it must not be forgotten that the results, pro-
viding that they have been properly obtained, will always have meaning. Thus on one
particular site a seismic refraction survey may give rather accurate depths to rockhead.
On the next site the field data may be difficult to interpret and the results of limited
Fig. 6.8. The shape of rockhead between boreholes revealed by geophysics
184 CHAPTER 6 · Field Tests and Measurements
value because of the complexity of the geology. This then demonstrates that additional
work, perhaps using other investigation techniques, is required in order to define site
geology accurately.
6.5.1
Geophysical Surveys
Geophysical surveys may be considered to take place in five phases of work. The first
of these is the acquisition of data in the field, the second is the processing of these
data to derive the maximum value from them and the third is the preliminary inter-
pretation of the processed data. In the forth phase the interpretation is checked against
physical observations of site conditions (from the results of boreholes, trial excava-
tions and so forth) perhaps made after the initial geophysical work. The fifth phase is
the re-interpretation, perhaps after re-processing, of initial data in the light of the
physical information.
All five phases of work have to be undertaken to an equal level of quality to achieve
a satisfactory end result. Basic data has to be acquired using suitable equipment and
with an intensity commensurate with the required accuracy of the end result. Data
must be stored in a form that allows it to be processed which generally means that the
data must be in digital form and stored on discs so that it can be fed into and pro-
cessed by a computer.
The most common interpretation discovers boundaries. Most non-geologists im-
mediately assume that the boundaries are those of a geological body for all non-ge-
ologists are accustomed to looking at geological maps and sections which show the
ground neatly divided into distinct, separately coloured layers. However, this tidiness
is imposed by man rather than nature – all geologists have seen layers or bodies of
ground which grade into each other with no clear and distinct separation. Geologists
have to make such separations in order to map geological units but the boundaries
used for mapping may be determined by such properties as fossil content, which have
no geophysical significance. When geophysical results are compared with records of
boreholes it does not necessarily follow that an apparently incorrect geophysical
boundary must necessarily be corrected to fit the borehole record; the boundaries
“seen” geophysically may not be those “seen by eye” in borehole samples.
While geophysical methods often produce results that seem to be of questionable
value, certainly with regard to the degree of accuracy required for engineering pur-
poses, geophysics is becoming a most important tool in engineering geology and has
the potential to become the most important method investigation in the future. The
reason for this is that one of the main aims of engineering geologists is to determine
the geotechnical properties of the mass and geophysical methods offer the only op-
portunity to examine ground conditions on the scale of the mass of ground un-
derlying or surrounding a proposed construction. The present developments in
micro-electronics and computers allow great improvements to be made in the quality
of data acquired in the field, in its processing, and in its interpretation. This progress
holds much promise for the future. In the early days of engineering geophysics, when
most data was analogue and interpretive techniques were primitive much geophysi-
cal work could be done by the engineering geologist with an appropriate background
in mathematics and physics. Today most data is recorded digitally and data process-
6.5 · Engineering Geophysics 185
ing has much improved the accuracy of interpretation. Such data processing and ma-
nipulation is beyond the capacity of most engineering geologists. The problems whose
resolution may be aided with the help of geophysics are becoming more complex es-
pecially in environmental geology. Accordingly, before a site investigation begins,
there is an increasing need for dialogue between engineering geologist and geo-
physicist to determine the best techniques to be employed and to design the geo-
physical survey. To some degree this problem has been resolved by the development
of ‘engineering geophysics’ and the ‘engineering geophysicist’ but the need for dialogue
remains.
The section that follows cannot go deeply into geophysics but confines itself to in-
dicating what methods are available, discussing their advantages and limitations and
indicating particular uses to which they may be applied.
Not all geophysical methods are of equal utility. An analysis made by Higginbottom
(1976) is given in Fig. 6.9 and shows the relative popularity of methods at that time in
Great Britain.
At that time there was much emphasis on marine construction associated with the
development of North Sea oil, so the most popular method was continuous seismic
profiling overwater. The techniques there recorded were used mostly to determine
boundary conditions. However, in the 1983 IAEG conference there was a section de-
voted to the use of geophysical methods to establish mass and material properties. Price
(1983) analysed the papers presented to indicate relative popularity. Seismic methods
remained the most popular but a new method, geo-radar, had entered the field and
Fig. 6.9. The relative impor-
tance of greophysical methods

(Higginbottom 1976)
186 CHAPTER 6 · Field Tests and Measurements
the use of several methods in combination had also become popular. The Working
Party Report on Engineering produced by the Engineering Group of the Geological
Society Geophysics (Geological Society Engineering Group 1988) has reviewed the
applicability of geophysical methods in engineering geology. The methods they list
that have been used include:
(cid:1) Seismic Refraction
Reflection (land and marine)
Cross hole
(cid:1) Electrical Resistivity sounding and imaging (2 and 3D)
Induced polarisation (IP)
Electromagnetic (EP)

6.5.2
Choice of Methods
In engineering geology, geophysics is used to determine boundary conditions, locate
bodies of unusual properties (voids, buried pipes etc.) or to determine the engineer-
ing properties of materials and mass. The choice of method will depend much upon
the particular circumstances of the work which may be not only geological but also
environmental. Thus seismic refraction work using explosives to generate the seismic
pulse is unlikely to be allowed in city centres and magnetometry would be unlikely to
be successful in cities due to magnetic disturbances from surrounding buildings, power
lines, pipes and so forth. The investigator must also not assume that only one method
is appropriate for a particular purpose. Thus while seismic refraction methods are
relatively useless as a means of finding underground cavities on a site of which noth-
ing is known, they might be able to detect zones of disturbance caused by the pres-
ence of cavities in a coal seam whose location is known. Economics also influences
the methods chosen; many geophysical methods have been automated where possible
so as to reduce the time they take and the manpower they require, man power being
the most expensive component of many methods and the basis upon which some may
be chosen. Investigators must be flexible and imaginative in their application of geo-
physical techniques.
6.5.3
Contaminated Land
The investigation of buried containers holding hazardous waste, of buried industrial
basements abandoned full of toxic chemicals, of unrecorded drains and sumps used
for the illegal disposal of liquid waste, and the existence of contaminated plumes in
groundwater at depth, some of which may be floating on the water table (light non-
aqueous phase liquids or L-NAPLS) some sinking through water bearing ground to
rest on low permeability layers (dense non-aqueous phase liquids or D-NAPLS) are
6.6 · Seismic Methods 187
part of the ground that now has to be investigated. Geophysical methods are used to
help define and quantify these conditions, and their applicability is still being realised.
Many techniques can be used; metal detectors for revealing buried metal containers,
electrical resistivity for detecting changes in water quality, ground penetrating radar
for locating trenches in which drains may be located etc. It is prudent to discuss the
problem to be solved with the engineering geophysicist so that the appropriate com-
bination of techniques may be applied.
6.6
Seismic Methods
If a seismic impulse is generated at surface by artificial means, for example by explo-
sives or hammer blows, shock waves radiate out into the ground and are reflected
back to the surface from any seismic boundaries in the ground mass. These bound-
aries may coincide with the geological boundaries between different types of mate-
rials. Seismic boundaries are distinguished by contrasts in velocity between two me-
dia and can refract waves as well as reflect them. Seismic waves are attenuated as
they pass through the ground; the depths to which the ground may be investigated
by seismic geophysics is related to the strength of the shock given by the seismic
source.
The seismic shock generates various types of waves. Those of greatest interest
are:
(cid:1) the compression (longitudinal) wave, in which the particles vibrate in the direction
of wave travel,
(cid:1) the shear (transverse) wave, in which the particles vibrate at right angles to the di-
rection of wave travel,
(cid:1) surface waves, which travel on a boundary and are distinguished depending on the
style of motion of the particle. In Raleigh waves the particles describe an elliptical
path; in Love waves the particle follows a transverse motion parallel to the surface.
The Raleigh wave is of some importance in engineering geophysics. The Love wave
is not generated by artificial shock waves to any significant degree but is of impor-
tance to earthquake seismologists.
In engineering geophysics it is mostly the compression (P) and the shear (S) waves
that are of significance. Their velocities are related to the densities and deformation
parameters of the materials through which they pass. Thus,
(6.11)
and
(6.12)
188 CHAPTER 6 · Field Tests and Measurements
where K=bulk modulus; G=shear modulus (modulus of rigidity=shear stress/shear
strain); ρ=density; V =compression wave velocity, and V =shear wave velocity.
p s
The ratio V /V is given by
p s
(6.13)
where v=Poisson’s ratio for the material.
It should be noted that because the shear modulus (G) is zero for fluids, shear waves
cannot pass through a fluid medium. Shear waves are always slower than P waves
(V /V is typically about 1.7) and the velocity of both P and S waves depends upon the
p s
elastic moduli of the material or mass. Thus materials with lower deformation moduli
will be expected to have lower velocities. This is borne out by observation.
Velocities quoted are usually P waves unless otherwise stated. Figure 2.12 shows how
velocity varies with density and porosity in limestones. Porous rocks will have fluids
or gasses in the pore spaces and velocity through the saturated rock will depend upon
porosity and the acoustic velocity of the pore fluid. Media have higher velocities when
saturated than when dry. This is indicated by the formula (Wyllie et al. 1958):
(6.14)
where V=velocity of the saturated rock; V =velocity of the fluid; V =velocity of the
f m
rock matrix, and φ=fractional porosity.
Velocity varies also dependant on the stress within the ground mass, higher stresses
giving higher velocities. The most noticeable increase in velocity is in the stress range
0 to 100 MPa.
Velocities measured in the field on various geological masses will be dependant not
only on the nature of the material but also on the intensity of fracturing and degree of
weathering of the mass. Table 6.3 gives ranges of velocities quoted in the literature. It
is seldom clear whether these are for materials or mass but they serve to illustrate that
stronger, denser materials and masses have higher velocities. What is of importance
is that the lower velocity layers lie mostly near surface and that higher velocity layers
lie under them.
In Fig. 6.10 part of the energy from the seismic source passes through the ground
as a surface wave, part is reflected from the V /V interface, part is refracted into
1 2
the V layer or, beyond the contact of the incident ray with the surface at the criti-
2
cal angle of incidence i , travels along the V /V interface and is refracted back to
c 1 2
surface.
Refraction will not occur from a low velocity layer overlain by a high velocity layer.
This is of some importance in engineering geophysics for such low velocity layers,
which are difficult to detect, may have low strength and would be thus of some impor-
tance to engineering projects.

6.6.1
Reflection Seismic Techniques
The seismic wave generated at the surface is reflected from boundaries underground.
If the time taken for the wave to travel from surface to boundary to surface can be
measured and the wave velocity is known, then the depth to that boundary can be
calculated. Seismic reflection surveys always employ ‘multi-channel’ equipment; in this
there is one ‘shot point’ (where the seismic signal is generated), an array of ‘geophones’
which will detect the arrival of the wave form back at the surface and a multi-channel
amplifier/processor unit to receive the data. Today it is common to employ more than
24 geophones in a geophone spread.
The data recovered may be displayed in a time/distance diagram. Commonly dis-
tance is on the horizontal axis and is equal to the length of the spread of geophones;
the vertical axis records wave arrival in milliseconds. Arrays of geophones, of the or-
der of some hundreds of metres long, are moved along a line of traverse which may
be many kilometres long. Reflection seismic sections are composed of the many ar-
rays along the line of traverse.
The geophone records the arrival of wave forms coming back from reflectors un-
derground. However, not all the wave forms returning are necessarily directly from
reflectors. Some of the waves may be partially refracted, some may be multiple reflec-
tions, others may be ground waves or air waves or simply noise from unidentifiable
sources. Original seismic results contain all these waves; the records must be processed
in order to recognise the reflections. Information is recorded digitally to allow it to be
fed into a computer for processing. Frequency filtering (convolution), in which cer-
tain frequencies in the returning waves are suppressed, may help to remove noise from
the record. However, this may also remove part of the reflected pulse. Inverse filtering
(deconvolution) may then be applied in which other properties of the pulse are used
to suppress noise and improve the character of the reflected pulse.
A reflection seismic survey programme has to be designed with regard to the ob-
jectives to be obtained. In general the important factors to be considered are the depth
to which data is required and the degree of detail with which the reflector surfaces are
to be examined. The depth to which the survey may be carried out and still recover
useful data is determined by a number of factors of which the most important are the
energy of the input signal relative to the attenuation characteristics of the ground and
the level of ‘noise’ in a particular area which may hinder recognition of the return of
reflected signals. The degree of detail (the resolution) with which reflectors may be
observed depends upon wave length (pulse length) and frequency of the signal. With
regard to vertical resolution the shorter the wave length the better the resolution. Seis-
mic surveys in which higher than usual frequencies (above 100 Hz) are recorded are
sometimes described as high resolution surveys. Horizontal resolution depends upon
the closeness of the spacing of the geophones in the seismic spread. It is often neces-
sary to begin surveys with a trial traverse to establish the level of noise in an area. The
survey technique and equipment may then be modified to obtain the best results. Pro-
cessing may improve the degree of resolution.
Noise is random and its effect may be reduced by ‘stacking’. In this the seismic ar-
ray moves along the traverse so that many recordings are made above a particular point
6.6 · Seismic Methods 191
on a reflector; superimposition (or stacking) of the data from all the recordings above
that point enhances the signal reflections while reducing noise.
Many seismic surveys produce profiles showing the geology along a line of vertical
cross-section. Cross profiles can be used to build up a three dimensional picture of
the geology. In such surveys seismic sources lie on the same line as the geophones.
Other surveys may use sources on one line and arrays of geophones on other parallel
lines. The data thence obtained may be used to directly interpret three-dimensional
geology.
The prime customer for seismic reflection surveying has traditionally been the pe-
troleum industry whose needs (in comparison with those of the engineering geolo-
gist) are for information on geological structure. The engineering geologist is con-
cerned to have somewhat finer detail and so seismic reflection work on land is rela-
tively little used for engineering geological purposes except for the investigations of
deep tunnels. If these are in mountainous areas then corrections for topography pose
a major problem. It is also important to note that most reflection seismic sections have
time as the ‘depth’ axis. To translate time to true depth, velocities have to be assigned
to the layers and boreholes must be sunk to determine what the layers consist of be-
fore the velocities can be given. In engineering geology, concerned mostly with shal-
low (<100 m deep) geology the layers are not only naturally variable by genesis but
also variably fractured and weathered, which will cause greater variations in veloci-
ties. For this reason most attention in engineering geology has been given to refrac-
tion seismic surveys in which velocity is measured and depths can thus be estimated.
Geophysicists are, however, now giving some attention to shallow reflection seismic
survey methods for use in engineering and hydrogeology.
The above remarks apply to reflection seismic surveying on land. There is very
extensive use of continuous (reflection) seismic profiling (CSP) overwater.
6.6.2
Continuous Seismic Profiling
Continuous seismic profiling (CSP) is undertaken over water, mostly at sea. A boat tows
a seismic source giving repeated seismic pulses followed by a string of hydrophones
floating at shallow depth below the surface of the water. The hydrophones receive the
reflected waves and after passing through a single channel amplifier/processor, their
arrival is recorded on a chart. The pulse is repeated at short time intervals (of the or-
der of 0.2 to 2 s depending on the system used) and an analogue record is built up
from the repeated recordings of the returning pulses. The record has time as the ver-
tical scale and distance as the horizontal scale. To keep the horizontal scale uniform
the vessel must move at constant speed. The position of the boat is monitored by an
electronic navigation system and ‘fixes’ may be recorded on the seismic record.
A variety of CSP techniques are available, largely distinguished by the nature of the
seismic source. The seismic pulse may be generated by air or water guns, electrical
spark discharge, gas explosions, rapid plate movement and so on. The sources vary in
power and frequency of the pulse and are thus capable of various depths of penetra-
tion and degrees of resolution. Thus “Pingers” are low energy sources generated by
piezoelectric transducer, operating in a frequency range of about 3000 Hz to 12000 Hz
192 CHAPTER 6 · Field Tests and Measurements
which give high quality resolution to depths of about 20 to 30 m. “Boomers” operate in
a frequency range of about 500 to 10000 Hz and may give penetration to about 50 m
with good resolution. The various types of “Sparker” operate within frequency ranges
of 50 to 5000 Hz, are higher powered than the Boomer and may give about 500 to 600 m
penetration with moderate resolution. In CSP surveys the technique is chosen rela-
tive to the purpose for which it is required. Thus for sea bed pipeline surveys a Pinger
may be considered appropriate while for an inter-island tunnel a Sparker survey would
yield the best information.
The results of the survey resemble a geological profile and are thus of some use in
establishing the shape of reflector boundaries. Depths have to be established by cor-
relation with boreholes. Figure 6.11 shows a profile, obtained using a sophisticated
seismic source known as ‘chirp’, which clearly displays layering, slumping and an
infilled valley in sediments. The clarity of the profile is partly due to the absence of
multiple reflections due to the absorption characteristics of the topmost sediments.
Such multiple reflections, commonly from the sea bed, may make it difficult to iden-
tify geological reflectors and interpret the records. Nevertheless the results may be of
great value for particular engineering purposes, such as the location of sea bed struc-
tures, examination of the geology along the lines of undersea tunnels and so forth.
Such surveys are usually done in conjunction with other types of sea bottom pro-
filing. Echo sounding will show the topography of the sea floor and ‘side scan sonar’, a
type of side-looking echo sounding, will give a picture of the sea floor on either side
of the CSP track. This latter technique is of great value in surveys for dredging pur-

6.6 · Seismic Methods 193
poses, for it may reveal the presence of reefs, boulders, old wrecks etc. which would
not necessarily be located by echo sounding.
CSP survey methods may be limited by navigational problems. Thus, in the con-
struction of power stations, tunnels for intake and outlet of cooling water may be driven
out under the sea. Investigations by CSP methods would be ideal for such tunnels but
impossible to undertake because of near shore navigational hazards.
6.6.3
Seismic Refraction Methods
Seismic surveys for engineering projects on land are mostly undertaken by the refrac-
tion technique. Twelve or more geophones are used in a traverse while the seismic pulse
is provided by explosives, falling weights or hammer blows.
Results are presented in a time/distance graph (Fig. 6.12) which, in favourable con-
ditions, will show a curve composed of straight line segments with increasing traverse
distance and with sharp segment intersections. The slope of each segment represents
a velocity and it is conventional to designate the velocity of the near surface layer as
V , the next velocity as V and so on. The depth (d ) to the first horizontal refractor is
1 2 1
given by:
(6.15)
An ideal time distance graph from multiple horizontal layers should show several
sloping straight-line sections of the graph, each corresponding to increasing layer
velocities; depths to layer interfaces and layer thicknesses may be computed by for-
mulae of increasing complexity.
If the refractor is dipping it is possible to gather data by reverse shooting (keeping
the geophones as before but putting the shot point at the other end of the traverse) to
calculate the dip of the refractor. If the refractor is undulating there are interpretative
Fig. 6.12. Time/distance graph
of refraction seismic survey
194 CHAPTER 6 · Field Tests and Measurements
techniques which allow the calculation of the depth to the refractor under each geo-
phone, so that, for example, an irregular rockhead surface under a soil cover may be
mapped. Mostly engineering sites are examined by a grid network of traverses, plot-
ting the levels of refractors and drawing refractor contours. However, it must be re-
membered that the real geological situation is three dimensional and not two dimen-
sional. Thus, on a hillside or above an irregular rockhead the first arrival recorded by
a geophone may come from a refractor not immediately beneath the geophone al-
though it is common practice to display refraction profiles as if they were vertical cross-
sections. It must also be remembered that the accuracy with which the refractor shape
can be plotted depends (just as it does in surface topographical surveying) upon the
density of observation points.
The depth to which the ground may be examined by the refraction method depends
upon length of traverse, velocities and attenuation factors of the strata and the energy of
the source. In much seismic refraction work a great part of the pulse is absorbed by
near surface soils, particularly if the seismic shock is generated by falling weights or
hammer blows. For engineering purposes investigations seldom require information to
depths of more than 100 m and traverse lengths of the order of 400 to 500 m are suit-
able. Data is recorded digitally to allow for processing and computer calculation of
results. The technique is particularly suitable for the investigation of ‘long’ engineer-
ing works involving excavation of materials, such as the construction of roads, canals,
railways, etc. Thus, for example, Tan et al. (1983) have described the use of refraction sur-
veys for the investigation of a proposed road construction in Singapore (Fig. 6.13).
Twelve, twenty-four or more geophones refraction seismic surveys are the task of a
geophysicist but simple surveys using the single geophone (single channel) seismo-
graph are now commonly undertaken by engineering geologists. As will be seen later
in this chapter the reason for these surveys may be other than simply to find the depth
of a refractor but many engineering geologists now use the single channel hammer
seismograph as geologists use a hammer. The basic idea of this device is instead of
using one shot point and twelve geophones, to use one geophone and twelve shot points
the seismic pulse being given by a sledgehammer blow on a steel plate resting on the
ground. The earliest model single channel seismographs simply recorded the time of
the first arrival and numerous hammer blows were needed to be assured that the true
first arrival had been recorded. Many an engineering geologist saw strong healthy
labourers reduced to shivering blistered wrecks in the course of a day’s survey in ar-

profile was prepared using a series of 12 channel seismic traverses
6.6 · Seismic Methods 195
eas of seismic ‘noise’. However, the invention of the enhancement seismograph, which
allows successive hammer pulse records to be ‘stacked’, changed this and surveys now
are undertaken with less effort and greater reliability. The energy that can be put into
the ground by a hammer blow is, however, rather limited and single geophone sur-
veys are employed generally when the refractor (usually rockhead under soil) lies at
depths of 10 to 15 m or less below surface.
6.6.4
Down-Hole and Cross-Hole Shooting
Seismic measurements are also commonly undertaken in boreholes. Two basic tech-
niques are used. In one a seismic impulse is generated in a borehole and passes through
the ground to be picked up by geophones implanted in other boreholes (cross-hole
shooting). In down-hole or up-hole shooting impulses are generated on surface or at
the bottom of the borehole and are picked up by an array of geophones in the bore-
hole. The former method can be carried out with explosives and hydrophones in a mud
filled borehole or (on a smaller scale) with special pulsers and pickups which can be
clamped in small diameter boreholes. Both techniques are mainly used to determine
velocities (thus aiding interpretation of both reflection and refraction seismic surveys)
to detect the presence of major discontinuities in rock masses or to assess quality of
the rock mass. Cross-hole shooting is particularly useful in investigations for tunnels.
Tunnel investigations commonly incorporate boreholes to tunnel level. Cross-hole
shooting between boreholes at tunnel level will give data relating to the longitudinal
homogeneity of materials along the tunnelling and is thus the only direct method avail-
able to investigate ground to be intersected by tunnels along their length.
6.6.5
Particular Applications of the Seismic Method
Seismic methods have been particularly helpful for assessing rock mass quality,
excavatability and the moduli for deformability.
Evaluation of Rock Mass Quality
It is often useful to determine the “quality” of the rock mass with regard to the execution
of a particular engineering activity involving the mass, e.g. tunnelling through it. Quality
should always be assessed relative to the process. Thus a strong unweathered rock mass
with widely spaced joints might be regarded to be of high quality with regard to founda-
tion construction on it but of poor quality with regard to ease of excavation in open cut.
Seismic geophysics can be used to contribute data to aid such assessments of qual-
ity. A significant concept is the idea of the “velocity ratio” or “velocity index” (in some
older articles this is referred to as the “fracture index”). In this the velocity measured
in the field on the rock mass in situ (V) is contrasted with that measured in the labo-
f
ratory on a fresh sample of rock material (V). This gives the velocity ratio (V):
l r
(6.16)
196 CHAPTER 6 · Field Tests and Measurements
which is less than 1. Low in situ velocities (and thus low velocity ratios) could be due
to one or a combination of the following factors:
(cid:1) weathering of the rock material (increasing weathering leads to decreasing velocity),
(cid:1) close spacing of discontinuities (the closer the spacing the lower the velocity),
(cid:1) openness of discontinuities (the greater the aperture the lower the velocity).
Since the influence of the factors can be assessed (although not with great accu-
racy) from examination of cores, outcrops etc. it is often possible to recognise the
dominant cause of low velocity ratios. This can only be done on uniform rock types.
The velocity ratio approach does not work well in heterogeneous rock masses.
Knill (1970) used velocity ratio to assess grout take in dam foundations. Measure-
ments were on saturated rock samples. Velocities on laboratory specimens may be sig-
nificantly higher on saturated specimens than on dry specimens and clearly tests should
be undertaken on rock samples with the same moisture content as the rock in situ.
If velocities can be used to assess potential grout take then they may also be used
to assess the success of the grouting operation. If openness of joints has significantly
influenced V then filling these joints with grout should increase V. Clearly V on a
f f f
grouted up mass will not reach V for the velocity of grout is lower than that of most
l
rocks and part of V could be influenced by material weathering which would not be
f
affected by standard grouting. An increase of dam foundation rock velocity as a con-
sequence of grouting is recorded by Knill and Price (1972).
Field velocities are obtained by conventional refraction surveys. In rocks which
display gradual changes in weathering grade the time/distance graph may have no
obvious breaks to determine depths to refractors. These curves may be manipulated
to allow the production of velocity contours at suitable intervals, which may indicate
variations of weathering grade. This is particularly useful if the increase in quality with
depth of an originally more-or-less homogeneous rock mass is being examined.
Edmond and Graham (1977) have described how seismic refraction traverses, together
with cross-hole and up-hole shooting provided data to help assess the quality of a
granite mass in order to choose the best level to drive a cooling water tunnel.
The velocity contour idea was extended by Cosma (1983) who examined rock masses
carrying ore bodies by cross-hole shooting. An automatic hammer was developed as
a source and receivers were designed to receive P and S waves. A computer program
was written to calculate velocities on a grid network within the area examined and
then these were plotted to give velocity density sections. In these, high velocity zones
were taken to indicate ore bodies while low velocity zones indicated weakened or bro-
ken rock. Such ‘tomographic’ techniques have clear application in engineering geol-
ogy in the examination of foundation masses, potential quarries and so forth.
Evaluation of Excavatability
The velocity of seismic waves through a rock mass decreases with increasing weath-
ering and increasing fracture intensity and openness in that rock mass. Experience
has given some idea of the velocity of seismic waves through unweathered, ‘normally
fractured’ masses composed of rocks of various types. If the velocity through a mass
6.6 · Seismic Methods 197
of a particular rock type is measured then the difference between this measured ve-
locity and that of the ‘standard’ mass of a similar rock type will give an idea of the
‘quality’ of the mass, this quality being assessed with regard to fracture intensity and
openness and to weathered condition. The ease with which rock masses may be exca-
vated depends upon the same parameters which may be used to gauge quality, so ve-
locity measurements on rock masses of known geology may be used to yield infor-
mation on excavatability.
It is particularly important, from the viewpoint of engineering economy, to know
whether a rock mass must be drilled and blasted before it can be excavated or whether
it can be dug directly with standard excavation machinery. Excavation preceded by
drilling and blasting is clearly much more expensive than that without such prior treat-
ment and important contractual distinctions between engineering ‘rock’ and engineer-
ing ‘soil’ are sometimes linked to the excavation technique. Accordingly the concept
of ‘rippability’ was introduced some decades ago. A ripper is a bulldozer equipped with
a weighted steel tooth which may rip into and loosen intact rock to a depth of usu-
ally something under a metre in order to allow it to be dug or scraped out by stan-
dard machinery. Rippability relationships have been established between type of
bulldozer (for clearly a more powerful and heavier machine could rip where a
lighter machine could not), rock type and field velocities measured on the rock type
to be excavated.
The technique has been used for many years with some success but the user has to
exercise some care:
(cid:1) In a dipping thinly layered mass composed of various rock types the velocity meas-
ured may be an average of high velocity unrippable rock in a greater mass of lower
velocity easily rippable rock. In such a case the harder higher velocity bands would
determine the rippability of the total mass.
(cid:1) Anisotropy in the rock mass giving anisotropic velocities. If the direction of lowest
velocity is the direction in which velocity is measured, while excavation takes place
in the direction of highest velocity, then excavation will be more difficult than expected.
Adequate knowledge of site geology will give warning of the first difficulty. The best
procedure is to combine rippability measurements with other techniques for evaluat-
ing rock mass characteristics (discussed in Chaps. 3 and 9) and to be sure that there
is a thorough understanding of geological characteristics of the rock mass.
Seismic fan shooting would provide data on anisotropy and help resolve the second
problem. In lithologically uniform rock masses anisotropy may be attributed to discon-
tinuity frequency, persistence and openness (Hack and Price 1990). Seismic traverses in
a fan array may show velocities suggesting the dominant joint direction Fig. 6.14).
Evaluation of Deformation Moduli
The relationships between seismic velocities and elastic moduli expressed by Eqs. 6.11
to 6.13 suggest that it might be possible to determine static elastic moduli of ground
masses through seismic measurements. There are, however, reasons why it is neces-
sary to distinguish between statically and dynamically derived moduli. These are that:
198 CHAPTER 6 · Field Tests and Measurements
Fig. 6.14. The plan shows joint
traces in a rock of homogene-
ous lithology. Joint x is persist-
ent, frequent and sometimes
open; joint y is impersistent,
tight and infrequent. A fan seis-
mic array would show a higher
velocity in direction B than in
direction A thus indicating the
strike of the dominant joint
(cid:1) the intensity of load imposed by the seismic wave is small and causes very much
smaller strains than that imposed by a large field test (and also by the proposed con-
struction), which are sufficient to cause large strains.
(cid:1) the seismic wave used acts for a very short time on the mass while the load used
to measure the static modulus is (by comparison) applied over a long period of
time.
It is now well recognised in continuum mechanics that shear modulus decreases as
shear strain increases and so it has been argued that there are three moduli which can
be measured:
1. the dynamic modulus (E or E ) determined by seismic means and applicable to
dyn seis
low stress levels;
2. the deformation modulus (E ) determined by in situ testing on ground masses
def
which do not behave elastically within the chosen stress range; and
3. the static modulus (E ) determined by in situ testing and measured on the elastic
stat
part of the stress/strain curve.
The stress range within which the modulus is calculated (perhaps as a secant modu-
lus) should relate to the loads imposed by the proposed structure.
The object of most investigations is to determine E of the groundmass within
def
the stress levels to be imposed by the structure; this should be a value appropriate to
the mass under the whole structure, that is, at the scale of the structure. Seismic mea-
surements offer the opportunity to measure a modulus at the correct scale; the prob-
lem is whether there is any relationship to be found between E and E .
def dyn
Van der Schrier (1990) compared statically and dynamically determined moduli
of elasticity for sedimentary rocks. E was determined on laboratory specimens and
stat
by P and S wave train measurements in the borehole using the Schlumberger Array
Sonic service. Good correlations were found but were essentially on materials, not mass.
Various authors have proposed correlations between E and E . Stacey (1976), for
def dyn
example, suggested that for preliminary engineering design purposes on rock masses
it was reasonable to assume that E =1/4E and E =1/8E . Aikas et al. (1983)
stat dyn def dyn
have recommended the use of seismic measurements to measure rock mass deforma-
6.6 · Seismic Methods 199
tion moduli under particular geological circumstances. They measured P and S wave
velocities and calculated E (rock mass modulus) by the formula:
M
(6.17)
where D=rock mass density.
Their objective was to give data for finite element models examining mine behaviour.
Their conclusion was that the moduli values obtained by these methods were useful if
the rock was compact, of high quality and under medium to high compression stresses.
What seems clear is that if a rock mass whose bulk characteristics approximate to
those of intact rock material and which behaves elastically within the stress range to
be imposed by the proposed work, then E , E and E are likely to be similar. If it
dyn stat def
does not behave elastically they will differ. In most rock masses, particularly those near
surface masses affected by weathering, joint opening etc. similar values for these moduli
seem unlikely. It has been proposed by Bieniawski (1989) that E (E ) could be as-
mass M
sessed for preliminary design by using his Rock Mass Rating (p.127):
E =2RMR–100 (6.18)
M
It may be speculated that the modification of seismically derived mass moduli by a
mass quality assessment obtained by rock mass classification offers the best chance
of determining static moduli on the scale of the engineering work. However, until such
research avenues are explored the most promising strategy is to compare moduli de-
rived from a variety of sources (such as laboratory tests on intact samples, pressure-
meter tests in boreholes and plate bearing tests) with seismically derived moduli and
deformations measured around engineering structures. Recent advances both in the
generation of seismic waves and in their recording have permitted calculation of shear
modulus with depth to be made, to depths of 10m or more depending on the soil or
rock. Waves are generated by a vibrator at ground level; boreholes are not required.
Values so obtained provide exceedingly good predictions of settlement based on plate
loading tests (Mathews etal. 1997).
Stress Measurements
It has frequently been observed that seismic velocities change as stress on the rock
changes; changes in velocities measured in chalk by cross hole measurements through
the ground stressed by a plate bearing test have been reported by De Ruyter (1983).
Generally the velocity increases with increasing confining stress until some other
change, such as microfracturing, changes the nature of the material.
Attempts have been made to assess stresses in tunnels and mines (mostly pillars)
by measuring velocities. These appear to have the greatest chance of some success if:
200 CHAPTER 6 · Field Tests and Measurements
i the rock is porous (porous rocks are more sensitive),
ii the rock is dry,
iii the rock is homogeneous,
iv the stresses to be measured are no higher than about 50 to 100 MPa, depending on
rock type, and
v variations in external factors (such as temperature, humidity etc.) are small.
Mostly researchers have attempted to measure changes in stress rather than an
absolute value, as can be done in a mine pillar with the help of velocity measure-
ments; when the pillar developes fractures prior to its collapse, velocities rapidly
diminished.
It has also been observed that as rocks or soils reach the point of instability, as the
result of landsliding or some similar agency, the development of fractures is accom-
panied by acoustic emissions. The onset of instability may be detected by arrays of
geophones planted in and around the ground mass. Acoustic emission has been stud-
ied for at least a half century (for example by Knill 1968) and is in use in some mines
as a means of monitoring stability. The advancing development of micro-electronics
suggests that it will become an increasingly important monitoring technique.
Determination of other Properties by Seismic Methods
Velocity measurements on uniform rock materials give the opportunity to assess
changes in material properties, such as density, porosity, strength etc., which might
occur as the result of weathering or alteration. While there are very general relation-
ships between these parameters and velocities for all rocks, velocity measurements
are only useful as an alternative to other tests when dealing with a single rock type.
It is possible that seismic measurements, combined with other tests of a simple nature,
may give the opportunity to determine other more complex parameters. Maris (1982)
has examined the possibility of determining the relative density of sands by a combina-
tion of seismic measurements and particle size analyses as an alternative to the Standard
Penetration Test. As a result of his work a very tentative relationship between P wave ve-
locity, D /D and relative density has been proposed. It should be noted that the rela-
50 10
tionship given is for sands under low confining pressure, velocity increases quite rapidly
as confining pressure increases. To arrive at relative density for a layer it would be nec-
essary to obtain seismic data by cross hole shooting, particle size analysis data by test-
ing samples and pressure by determining density and thence calculating pressure. Mois-
ture content must also come into consideration but the effect of this is not yet established.
The idea is not new. General relationships between SPT-N-values and P and S wave
velocities have been established by Baoshan and Chopin (1983) and Tonouchi et al.
(1983) but are somewhat general.
6.7
Electrical Resistivity Methods
All materials have electrical properties. One of the most important of these is the re-
sistance that a material offers to the passage of electrical current. It is well known that
copper has low resistance (or high conductivity) while rubber has high resistance (or
6.7 · Electrical Resistivity Methods 201
low conductivity). Groundwater has moderate resistance (50 to 500ohm-metres, Ωm)
but salt water is more conductive. In pure materials such as iron or aluminium the re-
sistivity is a property of that element. In geological materials the resistivity depends
upon the nature and the mixture of minerals of which the materials are composed and
whether or not water is present in pore spaces. Resistivities of clay materials can range
between 50 and 500 Ωm, those rich in quartz from 50 to 5000 Ωm.
If electrical current is passed into the ground and voltage measured between two
electrodes then resistivity of the ground may be measured. In the Wenner configura-
tion of electrodes current passes between two current electrodes and voltage is mea-
sured at two voltage (or potential) electrodes. The electrodes lie on a straight line and
are equally spaced. The apparent resistivity is given by the formula:
(6.19)
where ρ=apparent resistivity; a=electrode separation; ∆V=change in voltage be-
a
tween voltage electrodes; I=current between current electrodes.
Since, by Ohm’s Law V=RI, where R=resistance, electrical resistivity is expressed
in terms of ohm-units of distance. Commonly the units are ohm-cm, ohm-m and
ohm-ft. The most common unit today is the ohm-m.
The depth to which the current penetrates into the ground depends upon electrode
spacing; the wider the spacing the greater the depth of penetration. If the material that
the current passes through is uniform to infinite depth then whatever the electrode
spacing there will be no change in resistivity. However, if the ground under the elec-
trodes consists of a layered series of materials of different resistivities then, as elec-
trode spacing expands to give deeper current penetration, so will the measured “ap-
parent resistivity” change. If the material is uniform but saturated below a certain depth
(the water table level) then the apparent resistivity will also alter as the electrode sepa-
ration expands. The results of a resistivity survey are often expressed as a graph plot-
ting increasing electrode spacing against apparent resistivity.
It is possible to calculate the shape of the curve of electrode spacing against appar-
ent resistivity that would be produced from an expanding electrode survey conducted
over particular thicknesses and depths of layers of different resistivities. These curves
may be compared with those found in field surveys to give a method of interpretation
of survey data. Unfortunately several different models may give more-or-less the same
curve so there is no unique interpretation of results. Normally additional informa-
tion is required to ensure reasonable interpretation. This may be obtained from pub-
lished geological profiles or from boreholes.
Increasing the Wenner array electrode spacing to measure the resistivity of deeper
and deeper layers may be likened to the process of drilling a borehole and is some-
times referred to as ‘electrical boring’. If the electrode spacing is kept uniform (so that
depth penetration is constant) but the whole array moved laterally in the direction of
the array length then the process may be likened to that of digging a trench, for a change
in strata will be revealed by a change in resistivity. This technique is sometimes called
‘electrical trenching’. Its primary use is to trace boundaries, faults, concealed outcrops
etc. and is a useful aid to detailed mapping.
202 CHAPTER 6 · Field Tests and Measurements
The Wenner array is probably the best known but many other arrays are also in
use. The Schlumberger array has current electrodes symmetrically placed around the
potential electrodes but at greater spacings. Different arrays are described in the lit-
erature, each of which is of value for particular geological circumstances.
If the basic geology of an area is reasonably well known then the presence of ground-
water may be detected for this will modify resistivity. Since there is a difference be-
tween the resistivity of fresh and salt water it is possible to judge the quality of water
located.
If a series of constant electrode separation traverses are done on a grid network
then resistivity values may be contoured and anomalous areas revealed. Higginbottom
(1976) has described the results of a survey conducted to investigate the possibility of
locating fissures in rock.
6.8
Magnetic Methods
The earth’s magnetic field is generated by electrical currents circulating in its outer
core. Values of total intensity of the earth’s magnetic field vary from about 74000 gam-
mas (1 gamma=1/100000 oersted) at the poles to 30000 gammas at the equator. The
major variations in field strength and polarity direction relate to major continental
scale and deep seated geological factors. Minor and local variations depend upon the
nature of near-surface geological materials. Iron bearing geological bodies are mag-
netic and the materials of which they are composed have high “magnetic susceptibil-
ity”. The intensity of the earth’s magnetic field tends to be higher over bodies of min-
erals of high magnetic susceptibility. Magnetic susceptibilities of common minerals
and rocks are given in the Table 6.4.
Magnetic “anomalies” are values of the magnetic field intensity above (positive) or
below (negative) the general regional field intensity of the area.
The size and shape of magnetic anomaly will be due not only to the contrast in
susceptibility between a magnetic body and the surrounding material but also due to
the orientation of the magnetic body relative to the local direction of polarity of the
earth’s field. Linear features generally produce poorly defined anomalies if they are
orientated north-south.
The strength of the earth’s magnetic field may be measured using magnetometers.
Old style magnetometers measured either the vertical or horizontal components of
the earth’s field by measuring the deflection of bar magnets or dip needles. Measure-
ments using such instruments involved levelling the instrument and took some time
to complete. Instruments developed since World War II, the flux-gate and proton mag-
netometers, are electronic, require no levelling and readings may be taken very rap-
idly. Probably the proton magnetometer is the most widely used magnetometer for
ground engineering; readings may be taken at intervals of about 1 second. The detec-
tor head is separate from the recording instrument and may be towed behind an
aeroplane or even underwater behind a boat.
Surveys on land most often involve taking proton magnetometer readings at inter-
sections of a survey grid. No complex calculation is required to convert readings to
total intensity values. To prepare a magnetic anomaly map intensity values are sub-
tracted from the regional field intensity to allow anomalies to be plotted. The greatest

Table 6.4. Magnetic suscepti-
bilities of rocks and minerals
(emu=electromagnetic unit for
mass susceptibility, m3kg–1,
based on Hunt et al. 1995)
part of the work lies in setting out the survey grid. The value of the earth’s field varies
diurnally and this should be measured by returning to one spot at regular intervals
during the days work. The final plot may have to be corrected for this diurnal varia-
tion depending on its magnitude in comparison with the anomalies.
It is possible to link the detector head to an electronic location finding system and
link both to a micro-computer which will then prepare the magnetic anomaly map as
the survey proceeds.
Magnetic anomalies may reveal the presence of bodies of high magnetic suscepti-
bility surrounded by non-magnetic rocks under a cover of soil. Dykes of basic igne-
ous rock, which should produce anomalies, may be of engineering significance – they
could be associated with changes of rockhead level, form hard barriers to excavation
or present permeable zones in tunnelling. Buried landforms cut by erosion into mag-
netic rocks may also be detected by magnetometry.
Metal objects buried under soil may be detected by magnetometry and wrecks,
anchors, unexploded bombs etc. may be found on the sea bed.
Magnetometer surveys are particularly useful in areas where abandoned mine
workings are a problem. The mine workings may have many long abandoned shafts
leading to them and these, if poorly backfilled, may present a localised subsidence
problem. These shafts may be no more than three or four metres in diameter and thus
present a target almost impossible to find by boring. However, there is sometimes suf-
ficient magnetic contrast between the shaft lining and/or infilling and the surround-
204 CHAPTER 6 · Field Tests and Measurements
ing rock or soil to produce a detectable magnetic anomaly. A magnetometer survey
for an old mine shaft requires a survey on a grid network, with observations at 1 to
3 m spacings. Any anomalies found must be examined by excavations to find out what
the anomalies represent; Fig. 6.15. These could also reflect the presence of old foun-
dations, walls etc. associated with the old mine buildings. Excavations for old mine
shafts should be undertaken with some caution for the infilling might collapse under
the investigator.
The effectiveness of magnetometer surveys may be hampered by local magnetic
disturbances which could result from buried or overhead live electric cables, buried
pipes, wire fences and so forth. There is almost no chance of conducting an effective
survey in an urban area.
6.8.1
Electromagnetic Techniques
The description “electromagnetic methods” encompasses a wide variety of geophysi-
cal techniques and systems. They frequently involve observing the reaction of ground
masses to electromagnetic impulses of varying frequencies. Two methods are of fre-
quently used in engineering geology. These are induction methods and ground pen-
etrating radar.

ing the association of positive anomalies with the shafts (Higginbottom 1976)
6.8 · Magnetic Methods 205
Induction Methods
In these a cyclic magnetic field is generated by passing alternating electrical current
through a wire loop or through a wire grounded at both ends. The frequency of the
magnetic field may be between 100 Hz and about 5000 Hz. If any conductive mate-
rial lies within the generated magnetic field electrical currents will be generated in
it and these will, in their turn, generate a magnetic field. The total magnetic field then
existing may be considered to consist of the primary field (generated by the source
current) and the induced secondary field (generated by the conducting body). Mea-
surement of the characteristics of the total magnetic field and interpretation of
these in comparison with the primary field may lead to the detection of buried con-
ductors.
In the field the equipment may consist of a transmitting coil (transmitting the pri-
mary field) and a receiver coil (measuring the total field). Long wires may take the
place of coils. The method maybe applied on the ground or from aircraft.
Electromagnetic methods, of which there are many, are commonly described as EM
methods.
Interpretation of the results often relies upon comparison of measured values
with those calculated or observed to be caused by various shapes of conducting
bodies.
Ground Penetrating Radar
The basic principle of the transmission and reflection of electromagnetic waves in
order to establish the location of aeroplanes and aid ship navigation is well known.
Radar impulses have also some capacity to penetrate into the ground and to be re-
flected from less “permeable” layers in a way similar to that of seismic shock waves.
Because the radar signal is electrically generated it can be repeated continuously, rather
like the repeated seismic pulse used in continuous seismic profiling. If both sender
and receiver can be moved along the surface of the ground then the returning reflected
signals can be continuously recorded to give a record similar to that received from
CSP techniques (Fig. 6.11).
The radar pulse is reflected from a boundary, so that

the soil, the dielectric constant between the reflector and the surface and the shape of
the reflector are factors that affect the performance of ground radar.
The technique is still developing but shows great promise. Penetrations of up to
40 m have been recorded. The method will probably supplant seismic reflection and
refraction for shallow boundary detection once its development is complete. Darracott
and Lake (1981) provide a good introduction to the method.
6.9
Gravity Methods
The intensity of the earth’s gravitational field may be measured using gravimeters.
These are, in effect, extremely sensitive balances in which the very small movements
associated with variations in gravity between successive points of observation are
magnified to readability by mechanical or optical devices. They are sensitive to varia-
tions of about 1 part in a hundred million of the earths field (about 0.01 milligal, where
1 milligal=g/1000). The local value of gravity is affected by the density of the under-
lying geological material and by other factors, such as latitude, elevation, local topog-
6.10 · Further Reading 207
raphy and tidal effects. In order to determine variations in underlying geology by grav-
ity measurements the influence of these other factors must be assessed by use of vari-
ous corrections. The almost unquantifiable effects of rapid near surface density varia-
tions tend, in practice, to limit the application of gravity techniques in engineering
geology to the detection of major geological structures (faults, etc.). However, in cer-
tain conditions of uniform lithology it may be possible to detect features of engineer-
ing significance, such as underground cavities.
Surveys for such purposes are sometimes described as “microgravity surveys” im-
plying that the most accurate instruments are used to make observations on a close
network (<10 m station spacing). A particular application is finding karst cavities in
limestone. In theory quite small cavities at depth will give anomalies detectable by
modern gravimeters (Greenfield 1979). The problem is that the corrections to the raw
data required to isolate the anomalies are often much greater than the anomalies them-
selves and are difficult to estimate with the required accuracy. Thus, for example, while
gravity methods could in theory be used to detect karst on limestone dam sites this is
seldom done because the dam site topography imposes too many corrections to the
raw data. The method may, however, be useful on limestone coastal platforms which
could be the sites for airports or similar constructions which must be built on level
ground. Bichara and Lakshmanan (1983) have estimated embankment bulk densities
by this method.

Organisation, Design and Reporting of Site Investigations
Practical experience has shown that for a site investigation to be successful it must be
well planned and undertaken in an orderly manner, using appropriate and well main-
tained field and laboratory equipment, operated by experienced and skilled personnel.
Expertise in the mechanics of investigation (boring, testing etc.) is a routine re-
quirement in all investigations. The most difficult problem is how and where, and when,
to use the various ‘tools’ available to the site investigator. A philosophy of site investi-
gation has built up over recent years which proposes the idea of the developing inves-
tigation advancing in stages to a satisfactory conclusion, each stage being built on a
sound foundation of knowledge established by the previous stage.
7.1
Stages of Investigation
The stages of investigation described below are but the expression of a principle. The
stages do not need to be separate; they may merge into each other and additional stages
may be inserted.
7.1.1
Project Conception Stage
After the decision to initiate a project has been taken, a desk study is undertaken of
all available geotechnical, geological and topographical data. The proposed site and
its environs should be examined by an experienced engineering geologist. The objec-
tive of this stage is to try to identify potential problems that may arise from site
geotechnical conditions in relation to the proposed engineering work. Here it may be
noted that the term Site Investigation is taken by many to represent the investigation
of the site per-se, including its previous use, ownership, access etc. An investigation of
the ground at a site is thus a Ground Investigation and but part of a Site Investigation.
The engineering geologist is usually concerned with both these aspects of the work.
The geotechnical, geological and topographical data should include:
(cid:1) all available topographic maps,
(cid:1) all available geological and hydrogeological maps, memoirs and published articles
in the scientific journals,
(cid:1) aerial photographs at all scales,
210 CHAPTER 7 · Organisation, Design and Reporting of Site Investigations
(cid:1) records of natural hazards such as earthquakes, hurricanes, avalanches etc.,
(cid:1) site investigation and construction reports for adjacent engineering projects; pub-
lished articles on the geotechnical properties of the geological units to be found on
the site,
(cid:1) hydrogeological and hydrological data,
(cid:1) records of any past, present and future human activities which have, are or could
influence the geological environment.
The recommendation that the site be examined by an experienced engineering
geologist may perhaps be considered to verge upon self-advertisement in a book writ-
ten by an experienced engineering geologist. However, there is no doubt that the sig-
nificance and even the presence of important geological features on the site can most
quickly be recognised by those who are skilled in this work. A few days work by an
experienced engineering geologist may save much time and trouble; i.e. money.
7.1.2
Preliminary Investigation Stage
The evaluation of a project at its conception stage may reveal significant gaps in basic
knowledge of the site, so that no recognition of likely problems is possible. In such a
case some preliminary investigation may be required to establish that basic knowl-
edge. This would be undertaken using relatively simple and inexpensive techniques,
such as existing records (maps, photographs, etc.), geological and engineering geo-
logical mapping, geophysics and perhaps some boreholes. The boreholes could be un-
dertaken partly as an experiment to determine the best method for the boring, sam-
pling and in situ testing to be undertaken in the main stage of investigation. At the
end of this stage there should be sufficient knowledge of the site to allow design of
the main ground investigation.
The first two stages of investigation are sometimes described as the reconnaissance
investigation or feasibility investigation. If a number of sites are being investigated prior
to choosing one for development the feasibility investigation may give sufficient in-
formation to allow the choice to be made.
7.1.3
Main Investigation Stage
In the main investigation stage the work done should recover the information required
to design the engineering project. This information is obtained by whatever means
are appropriate to the ground conditions and the nature of the engineering work. It is
possible that some of the investigation work may be difficult and expensive to under-
take because of problems of access to the locations of boreholes or in situ tests. Often
these problems are easier to overcome during the construction of the project when
earthmoving equipment is readily available and there is a great temptation to post-
pone necessary investigation until construction begins. This temptation should be
resisted for it is possible that postponed items of the main investigation could reveal
ground conditions which would invalidate project design. The client always pays for a
ground investigation; the cheapest way is to commission one and the most expensive
7.1 · Stages of Investigation 211
way is to “save” on one, but pay for it later with the delay and redesign that can follow
a problem which was not foreseen. No project should be designed on the assumption
that the ground conditions will prove to be satisfactory.
7.1.4
Construction Investigation Stage
One of the unfortunate facts of site investigation is that the prognoses made in the
investigation reports resulting from the main investigation are seldom absolutely and
totally correct. The construction of the project quite often reveals discrepancies be-
tween the ground conditions forecast and the ground conditions encountered. How-
ever, if the investigation is well done the client will have been warned that some varia-
tions in particular aspects of the ground (e.g. depth to bedrock) must be allowed for
and in this way these variations need not cause significant project re-design and can
be accommodated in the contract. The ground conditions encountered must be moni-
tored, recorded and assessed. If no satisfactory assessment can be made on the basis
of the information recorded then additional investigations must be undertaken to
obtain further data and thence resolve any anomalies.
A theoretical example of what might happen is given in Fig. 7.1 which shows a geo-
logical cross-section (Fig. 7.1a), composed from the observations on the samples from
two boreholes and an outcrop, and indicating uniformly dipping sandstones and shales
overlain by soil. Dips were measured on cores and outcrop and appeared to be more-
or-less uniform. However, when the soil over rockhead was removed a fault was ob-
served. There was no way this could be forecast from the data available. It has prob-
ably only a small displacement but may well be found in the diversion tunnel and the
question is whether or not it will have any significant effect on tunnel construction.
Clearly further investigations should be initiated to gain more data on fault location,
displacement and openness to assess its significance, but the prudent engineering
geologist would have ensured that the client had a reserve for just this sort of “un-
known”. The secret is to be aware of what you do not know – in this case the engineer-
ing geologists should be aware that nothing was known about the location of faults.
7.1.5
Post-Construction Investigation Stage
The behaviour of the completed engineering work will have been computed on the
basis of data acquired in the earlier stages of investigation. Certain features of
behaviour, such as settlement, may take many years to become complete after construc-
tion of the project. If observed behaviour is not the same as anticipated behaviour this
may indicate that the properties of the ground are affected by some unforeseen and
previously undetected factor. Further investigations may be required to resolve this
anomaly.
Monitoring of behaviour of the engineering project and comparison with predicted
performance is of vital importance for all engineering works although contract ar-
rangements often seem to hinder such monitoring. It must be remembered, however,
that major engineering disasters mostly take place some time after completion of the
work. The importance of post construction monitoring is thus clear. Anomalies of

suggests that the diversion tun-
nel might encounter some diffi-
culties due to the presence of

project behaviour must be observed, their cause established and remedial measures
undertaken before severe damage or perhaps failure can occur.
7.2
Design of Site Investigations
While the concept of the development of site investigations in stages provides a phi-
losophy of investigation procedure it does not answer the question “…but what do I
actually do?” which is so often asked by engineers when they are confronted with the
need to design an investigation for a particular project.
7.2 · Design of Site Investigations 213
The answer to this question may be found by reviewing the purpose of investiga-
tions, which is to determine the behaviour of the ground in response to the construc-
tion of the engineering work. This ‘behaviour’ is calculated using the procedures, for-
mulae etc. established in the various branches of engineering and applied earth sci-
ences. Before the calculations can be made data dealing with the properties of mate-
rial and mass, location of layer boundaries, and discontinuities and so forth, must be
available so that it can be introduced into the calculation procedures; only then is it
possible to obtain a numerical assessment of ground behaviour. What sort of data and
how much data is needed depends upon the geological conditions and materials that
are considered to be present, and the form of analyses that is to be used. The analysis
will attempt to predict stability and deformation of the ground during construction
in response to the unloading and subsequent re-loading it will experience. Most analy-
ses require representative geological inputs. It is for this reason that engineering ge-
ologists should be acquainted with the rudiments of soil and rock mechanics and better
still, a working knowledge of these subjects. Similarly, geotechnical engineers should
be aware of the constraints that can be imposed by geological materials, structures
and conditions upon the theories they intend to use for calculating their predictions.
To all this must be added the subject of ground water as it influences the effective stress
in the ground and can promote volumetric changes in some rocks and soils. In this
regard fine grained sedimentary rocks and soluble sedimentary rocks should be con-
sidered with great care. Use should always be made of Case Histories – a much ne-
glected and often forgotten source of invaluable knowledge. The size of this model will
depend on the volume of ground which will influence or be influenced by the engi-
neering work.
As the number of different materials present and the regularity and way with which
they are distributed depends upon the geology of the site so the intensity of investi-
gation (the number of boreholes, samples, geophysical traverses etc.) will in part de-
pend upon the complexity of site geology. Complex geological situations will gener-
ally require a greater intensity of investigations than simple geological situations.
7.2.1
Building the Geotechnical Model
The process of building up the geotechnical model begins with a first appraisal of the
geology based on available existing information, perhaps followed by geological map-
ping of the site on a large scale (say 1:1000 or 1:500). This information is interpreted
by standard geological procedures to establish a prototype geological model. A study
of this model should indicate certain locations on the site where boreholes may most
appropriately be sunk and perhaps geophysical work undertaken to verify or modify
the geological model. The aim of this work is to determine layer boundaries and to
establish an idea of the nature of these layers. If boreholes are used samples must be
taken. If soils are being investigated then probably the first type of boring would be
the percussion borehole, recovering tube ‘undisturbed’ samples and disturbed bag
samples. Normally in such work the driller is instructed to take samples at regular
intervals, say at every 1.5 m for tube samples, or at changes in strata. This rather low
quality and quantity sampling is just to get an idea of the nature of the materials. In
rock the initial boreholes are rotary core drilled, often at a somewhat larger diameter
214 CHAPTER 7 · Organisation, Design and Reporting of Site Investigations
than may later prove to have been necessary in order to assure good recovery. This is
done because subsequent drilling in rock may be undertaken in order to determine
strata boundaries and open-hole methods could be used if there is good initial knowl-
edge of the litho-stratigraphy.
The materials recognised in the samples belong to geological bodies which were
penetrated by the boreholes. The shape of these bodies determines the distribution
of materials under the site. Shape can be assessed by correlation between boreholes
but this assessment can be greatly aided by the use of geophysical techniques (such as
seismic refraction or reflection, ground penetrating radar or electrical resistivity) to
determine boundaries. The ‘model’ distribution of materials built up from these data
must then be tested for geological credibility. In other words whether the way in which
the groundmass appears to be built up from the evidence available seems likely in the
light of the known geological history and structure of the region.
This first model is then examined further by boring, geophysics or other methods,
to verify the concept and to obtain the samples that may be necessary to deal with the
particular problems posed by the combination of ground conditions and engineering
work. Thus for some problems special samplers may be necessary to obtain high quality
samples for drained triaxial tests or consolidation tests. The quality of sample is re-
lated to the degree of accuracy and reliability of test results required.
Samples may be taken from boreholes but also ‘samples’ may be tested in situ –
access to these sample locations may be gained by boreholes, trial pits, trenches or
shafts.
The degree of precision required in the assessment of ground conditions relates to
the likely magnitude of ground reaction as a consequence of the construction of the
engineering work. If the reaction is likely to be such that the success of the engineer-
ing project is in doubt then the quantity and quality of sampling, testing and inter-
pretation must be high. Unfavourable ground behaviour could come about as the re-
sult of a simple structure being built in difficult geological conditions or a very com-
plex engineering work being executed in simple geological conditions. It follows then
that each investigation, whose design relates to both geology and the nature of the
engineering project, is unique. Thus there is no standard form of site investigation for
a particular type of work. Each investigation is a completely new venture.
7.2.2
Guidelines for Design of an SI
Although each investigation should be considered as individual many share common
objectives and the actions needed to achieve these provide guidelines which may help
the design of an investigation. These are:
(cid:1) Determine the nature of the engineering work as far as is possible. It is necessary to
know size, loads imposed, depths of excavations etc. desired by the client’s propos-
als before planning the investigation.
(cid:1) Determine the geology, geomorphology and hydrogeology of the area of the site and
its environs.
(cid:1) Determine the nature of the geological environment and the likely influence of any
human activities on the site.
7.3 · Progressive Evaluation of Site Investigation Data 215
(cid:1) Establish the size and location of the ground mass that could influence or be influ-
enced by the engineering work.
(cid:1) List the data which must be acquired to allow the necessary calculations that relate
to the proposed engineering work to be made.
(cid:1) Consider the best means of acquiring the data.
(cid:1) Design a preliminary stage of investigation.
A good principle of design is to consider that each investigation must be economi-
cally efficient in the sense that the cost of the investigation must be money well spent.
The investigator must be able to justify each and every item in the site investigation
in terms of the value of that item in building up the geotechnical model. The investi-
gator must be able to show good and sufficient reason for undertaking each part of
the investigation.
While the idea of being able to justify each item of the investigation imbues the
investigation with a sense of purpose and discipline (and will also prove popular with
finance administrators) there is a danger that the investigator might become fixed on
a wrong path and try to prove pre-conceived ideas rather than find the true situation.
There is some justification for the ‘random’ investigation, undertaken almost at the
completion of the geotechnical model, which tests the validity of this model. The more
complex the geology and the more important the project, the greater is the need for
this ‘insurance’.
7.3
Progressive Evaluation of Site Investigation Data
The data that is recovered from a site investigation must be evaluated in the course of
the investigation and not left as an exercise to be undertaken once the fieldwork is
over, so that, if necessary, the location of boreholes, trial pits etc., may be altered. It is
easy to forget that the principle purpose of a ground investigation is to understand the
ground, and this is best acquired whilst the investigation is in progress. The investiga-
tion data will refer mostly to two types of knowledge, first the location of engineering
geological unit boundaries (layers, bands, discontinuities, etc.) and second the
geotechnical properties of mass and materials.
The first sort of investigation data is most readily displayed on cross-sections and
maps. Data received from boreholes or geophysics may be shown on borehole records
or on profiles. Study of these records, together with the results of any testing on the
samples retrieved, should allow the investigator to recognise boundaries between en-
gineering geological units (layers of material with similar geotechnical properties) and
to determine their level (relative to the datum plane of the site map). These levels may
then be plotted on the map and strikelines (contour lines on geological surfaces) may
be drawn for the boundaries. The results of the investigation in terms of the distribu-
tion of materials all over the site may then be seen.
The distribution of these strikelines, together with any other published informa-
tion about the geology of the area, may give the investigator a theory about the nature
of the geological structure being investigated and subsequent investigation works may
be planned with the intention of proving or changing the first theory. If this idea is
followed it ensures that at all times the investigation has a plan and a purpose.
216 CHAPTER 7 · Organisation, Design and Reporting of Site Investigations
Similarly, once testing has been undertaken to establish the geotechnical proper-
ties of the various materials the results of this testing must be compiled to allow as-
sessment of the engineering geological units. This compilation is best done in tabular
form. After the first compilation the data may be recompiled into units with similar
geotechnical properties – property boundaries must be established by the investiga-
tor with regard to the nature of the engineering work.
7.4
Investigation Progress and Engineering Design
Engineering design of a project begins immediately after project conception and of-
ten before any significant site investigation can take place. The first design is thus based
on assumed, generally favourable, ground conditions. If the assumptions are proved
false then the project must be partially or wholly re-designed.
While project re-design is almost inevitable in the early phases of the development
of a project, re-design due to faulty knowledge of ground conditions should be reduced
once site investigations have commenced by the continuous interchange of informa-
tion between investigator and project designer. This liaison is essential to prevent
wasted effort in design and in investigation. Table 7.1 shows where, in the progress of
an investigation, such liaison is appropriate.
Table 7.1. Stages of investigation and the progress of engineering design
7.6 · Supervision of Investigating Works 217
7.5
Tender Visits
Engineering projects (including site investigations) are generally put out to tender.
The first man to visit the site may then be an estimating engineer, on site to collect
the contract documents and view the site with other contractors. Such a visitor should
return to his office with information that will be of help to engineering geologists and
geotechnical engineers for their part of the project. It is important that this informa-
tion should be adequate, particularly if the site is in some far distant land which is
difficult and expensive to visit. It is always useful to bring back:
i topographical maps of the area in which the site is situated;
ii geological maps and reports;
iii aerial photographs;
iv details of transport infrastructure;
v addresses of government agencies;
vi photographs of the site.
In some countries any of the above items could be considered a subject of national
security and attempts to obtain one or more of them can result in the innocent enquirer
being “detained”; be prudent!. Sometimes samples of rock or soil may be brought back,
particularly if the project includes the use of natural materials for construction pur-
poses. Any samples should be of a size and volume to be representative of the mate-
rial from which they were collected (Table 7.2).
7.6
Supervision of Investigating Works
Having won the contract for a ground investigation and designed both its content and
organisation, it is necessary to ensure the work is conducted properly. This requires it
to be supervised by an engineering geologist. Much can happen during these investi-
gations that needs an informed decision to be made at the time. For example, a bore-
hole being drilled according to required standards, may collapse. Should the drilling
crew (a) abandon the hole; (b) grout the hole in the region of the collapse and try to
re-drill; (c) investigate the cause of the collapse or (d) just move to another point a
few metres away and start again? Or again, a trial pit may be 1.5 m below ground level
when one of its faces collapses and the pit half fills with water. Should the pit (a) be
continued to its designated depth of 2 m; (b) be abandoned; (c) back filled immedi-
ately; (d) relocated? An engineering geologist is best able to sensibly answer these
questions so as to move the investigation forward in a positive way. Unsupervised work
provides, at best, an inadequate record of the ground and at worst a wrong record,
from which will be made incorrect predictions of the ground and its reaction to the
engineering works proposed – the precise situation the investigation was commis-
sioned to avoid! There is no substitute for careful supervision and a site investigation
that has been supervised will always provide more trustworthy data than one that
has not.

7.7
The Engineering Geological Situation
The end product of material and mass properties, of mass fabric, of geological envi-
ronment and so forth is the description of the engineering geological situation. This
presents to the engineer, architect, mine engineer, or whoever is concerned with the
proposed project, the data needed in order to determine the reaction of the ground
and thence correctly design the engineering work so the ground reaction will not
damage the work. This presentation of data and opinion is no light and easy task but
it is absolutely essential that it be done satisfactorily. Some clients want only the facts,
a Factual Report. Factual data must be accurately presented in a matter such that it
cannot be misunderstood. Other clients request both the facts and an interpretation
of them, an Interpretative Report; here opinion must be presented with clarity and
objectivity. The main problems in doing this are:
7.9 · The Form of the Report 219
(cid:1) that accurate presentation of data is an arduous and difficult task;
(cid:1) that the presentation must be made in terms that are to be readily understood by
the reader who may not have the depth of technical knowledge possessed by the
writer.
However, despite the difficulties of the task of presentation it must be undertaken.
It must not be forgotten that the reports in which the presentation is made (commonly
reports on site investigations) may form parts of contractual documents. Claims and
lawsuits may be the result of inaccurate or poor quality reporting. Worse still, misun-
derstood reports could lead to fatalities and engineering disasters if the data or opin-
ions they appear to present are acted upon. It must also not be forgotten that the re-
port document, together with any maps, plans, profiles etc. that it contains, represents
the cost of the investigations. It is common for projects to be constructed some years
after the completion of investigations, when all samples have disappeared, all trenches
filled in and so forth. All that remains is the report on whose contents design is then
based.
7.8
Investigation Reports
The results of a site investigation are generally expressed in the form of a report. This
contains a written text to which are added tables or graphs giving test results, and maps
and diagrams illustrating the location of site investigation works, site geology and
perhaps the recommendations of the investigator. All reports should be of a good lit-
erary standard. Diagrams and illustrations should follow the proposals set out in the
section on engineering geological mapping. Borehole records should be prepared to
standards similar to those shown in Fig. 7.2. Each illustration or table may, in use,
become separated from the main body of the report. They should thereafter be pre-
pared as independent documents containing sufficient data to locate the information
they contain to the site in time and space.
7.9
The Form of the Report
Every organisation has its own way of preparing a report, which may be varied de-
pending upon the project. The following basic scheme of report writing may prove
useful for those who have little previous experience of report preparation.
Title page. This should show the name of the project, the name of the organisation or
individual preparing the report, the report number (as used in the filing system of the
writers), the date of the publication of the report.
Report ‘contents’ page. This should show the titles of the main sections of the report
and the page on which they may be found and also list all figures, tables, borehole records
and so forth, that may be included.
220 CHAPTER 7 · Organisation, Design and Reporting of Site Investigations
Fig. 7.2. Example of a borehole log through soil
7.9 · The Form of the Report 221
Introduction. A brief description of the purpose of the site investigation, which should
in itself explain the design of the investigation, the name of the client and of those who
designed the investigation, the dates of the beginning and the end of field work and
laboratory testing and any special instructions given by the client.
Description of the project. A brief description of the purpose and design of the project.
Topography and geology of the site. A description of the topography of the site at the
time of the investigation, including comments on land use and access to the site. The
basic geology of the site should be described making a clear distinction between infor-
mation available before the investigation and that gained during the investigation. Com-
ments regarding possible natural hazards should be made here as well as a review of
site climate, if these are of significance.
Site investigation. The site investigation work done is described in this section, which
may be divided into sub-sections such as “Borehole”, “In situ testing”, “Laboratory test-
ing” as appropriate. This section must be factual and correct, for it may be used as a
basis for billing the work done in the contract.
Results of site investigation. This section describes the geotechnical model built up
from the data discovered in the course of the investigation. It should be divided into en-
gineering geological units and a description of each unit (its location and properties) given.
Influence of ground conditions on project construction. This gives the opinions of
the investigator on the likely behaviour of the ground as a response to the construction
of the project and also the response of the construction to the behaviour of the ground.
Advice on foundation design and construction, excavation techniques and so forth are
presented. The section may be divided in relation to the various parts of the project.
Discussion. A discussion may be included in the report. This may consider the reli-
ability of the investigation data, recommendations for further investigations and so
forth.
7.9.1
Other Aspects of Report Preparation
Each of the sections described above should contain references to figures, tables etc.
which are generally presented after the text. Tables and figures are best presented on
separate pages, they should not be included in the text. Each page of the report should
be numbered. This may usefully be done describing each page ‘X’ of ‘Y’ pages, ‘X’ be-
ing the number of the page and ‘Y’ the total number of pages in the report text. The
contents page should be Page 1. Any standards, norms, textbooks, scientific articles
etc. referred to in the report should be given a reference number in the text which re-
lates to a list of references at the end of the report. References should be given in a
uniform way, following one of the systems recommended by the scientific journals.
222 CHAPTER 7 · Organisation, Design and Reporting of Site Investigations
Appendices. Appendices may be used to give additional information essential to a
proper understanding of the report. Such information could be, for example, an expla-
nation of a method of geophysical interpretation or the execution of a laboratory test.
Appendices should not contain information generated by the investigation.
7.9.2
Borehole Records
Boreholes are one of the primary tools of site investigation and the way in which bore-
hole data is presented must be carefully considered. A good and uniform standard must
be achieved. An example of a good standard of borehole record is given in Fig. 7.2.
The method of presentation is to show information in columns and blocks. The blocks
at the top of the record deal with the methods of drilling and the reference number
and location of the borehole. Those at the bottom give the names of contractor, client,
a key to some of the symbols used on the record and observations (remarks) about
unusual circumstances connected with the sinking of the borehole. The data derived
from the borehole is held within columns between the top and bottom blocks.
To the left, on the binding margin of the record, there are columns showing loca-
tion of samples, progress of the borehole, water levels, core recoveries and/or results
of penetration tests and a column for core size and/or sample type. To the right there
is a column for the description of the strata found in the borehole. A centimetre scale
is drawn on two of the vertical lines to allow the borehole to be drawn accurately to
scale. At a scale of 1:100 the record can present up to 20 m depth of borehole. The sym-
bolic log is placed on the right hand side next to a column in which the levels of strata
boundaries (relative to the locally used horizontal datum plane) are given. If all the
borehole records presented are kept to the same scale the user may overlap a series of
borehole records and compare symbolic logs along a line of section.
Young engineering geologists charged with the task of preparing such records of-
ten ask why the various blocks and columns of information are necessary. There is a
reason for each information block.
Starting at the top left of the record the blocks entitled “Drilling method”, “Core
barrel and bit design” and “Machine” tell the skilled borehole record reader whether
the drilling equipment used was adequate to drill the strata recorded. If not then loss
of core or sample might be attributable to poor drilling rather than poor ground con-
ditions. That the drilling equipment was not suited to the strata to be drilled is not
necessarily the fault of the driller or drilling contractor for the geological conditions
found might have been totally unexpected. Finding the unexpected by the process of
investigation is, after all, the purpose of investigation. Such information is particu-
larly valuable if the borehole reports relate to a preliminary stage of the investigation
– appropriate equipment can then be chosen for the main stage. The strata descrip-
tions that are written in the “Description of Strata” column must be written with re-
gard to a recognised system for the description of soil and rock materials, preferably
that system used in the country in which the investigation was undertaken. It is useful
to mention the system used in the text of the main report.
However, while descriptive standards help to decide whether, for example, a sand-
stone is thinly bedded or thickly laminated, they do not help the sample logger to de-
cide what to call the materials encountered or to decide where to establish boundaries
7.9 · The Form of the Report 223
between strata of different types. This is perhaps rather more difficult a problem with
rocks than with soils. There are three common problems:
1. Establishing boundaries in strata that are uniform in nature. Here the temptation is
to say that the rock is uniform while it might be possible to describe differences of a
rather more subtle nature than is common on rock description, such as, for exam-
ple, between “sandy mudstone”, “slightly sandy mudstone” and “very sandy
mudstone”. Whether such subtlety of description is necessary or not will depend
upon the nature of the project. For rock dredging it could be of great importance
while it could be of no significance for determining the depth of mudstone overbur-
den over limestone to be quarried. The need for subtle distinction between rather
similar strata will depend upon the nature of the project. The real problem comes
when the logger must log without much idea of what the project is about.
2. In some rock and soil successions there are very frequent but distinct strata differences
to be seen. One which is particularly common is the rapid alternations of shale and
fine sandstones that occur, for example, in parts of the Carboniferous. If alternate
bands are, say, 2 cm thick then ‘very thinly bedded alternating SHALES and fine
SANDSTONES’ is appropriate. If the layers are more than a metre or so thick then
they could be described separately. The problem arises when the layers are, say, 20
or 30 cm thick. Again as with the first difficulty, what is done depends upon the na-
ture of the project for which the borehole record is being prepared.
3. Constraining strata descriptions within the type space limitations of the borehole
record form. The description should not be too verbose; keep to the point and en-
sure the essentials are recorded.
An example of a good log in rock is given in Fig. 7.3. Ground levels must be recorded
for it sometimes happens that in the initial stages of construction general excavation
changes site levels. If it is by chance assumed that the borehole started from the changed
site level then calculations with regard to the depths of layers would be incorrect.
Orientation of the borehole must be known in the case of inclined boreholes. This
is mostly given in terms of direction of the hole (relative to magnetic north) and dip
of the hole from the horizontal. It is very valuable to put a co-ordinate reference, rela-
tive to the national co-ordinate reference system, on every borehole record. Most re-
ports contain site plans showing where the borehole was drilled relative to features in
the landscape which existed at the time of the investigation. However, between inves-
tigation and construction these may have disappeared, perhaps as a result of site prepa-
ration. Boreholes can always be relocated on site if the grid reference is known. This
should be given to the nearest metre.
Every borehole should be numbered. The numbering system should be kept as
simple as possible. If boreholes are longer than one record sheet can hold then the use
of the “sheet X of Y” tells the reader this. Second sheets should, in principle, hold the
same amount of block data as the original sheet. Every site has a name and this must
be given on the record. One difficulty is that the site name given at the time of inves-
tigation is not always that of the construction site. At the bottom of the record there
are blocks for the name of the contractor (if a site investigation contractor is used)
and for the client. Mostly a contractor or consulting engineer prepares the record and
the record would have a printed logo with name and address.

debate to decide whether or not this should appear on a record. Mostly the company
employing the logger is responsible under law for the accuracy of the record and it
could be argued that omission of the logger’s name ensures that he or she would suf-
fer no personal difficulties in the event of dispute. On the other hand it may also be
that the user of the record might want to contact the logger for reasons other than
legal dispute, perhaps, to ask for an opinion based on personal knowledge which was
not requested at the time.

Ground Behaviour
Chapter 8
Ground Response to Engineering and Natural Processes
Three verbal equations were set out in Chap. 1 which describe the procedure whereby
the engineering behaviour of the ground may be deduced. To achieve this end it is,
therefore, necessary to determine the material properties, the mass fabric and the ap-
propriate environmental conditions, although the same level of detail is not necessary
for all projects. For example, there are many ‘engineering properties’ and only some
may relate specifically to particular types of work. Mass fabric can, for example, be
established to various degrees of detail depending on the nature of the project. By way
of illustration, if it is proposed to construct a lightly trafficked road through a flat land-
scape underlain by unweathered gneiss then it will be unnecessary to know much about
the orientation (i.e. mass fabric) and strength (i.e. engineering property) of the
discontinuities in that gneiss. However, if it is proposed to drive a tunnel through the
same rock mass then both the discontinuity strength and orientation are essential
parameters for that tunnel design.
Each engineering project may be regarded as being composed of a series of ‘engi-
neering processes’, each producing various possible ground reactions. It is important,
therefore, to establish the processes which will be undertaken in any project, in order
to qualitatively assess the ground reaction to each of those processes, as well as deter-
mine the quantitative data which must be acquired by investigation in order to analyse
the engineering behaviour of the ground mass.
8.1
Engineering Processes
There are many different types of engineering work but, during construction and/or
after completion, they impose one or more ‘engineering processes’ on the ground which
are as follows:
(cid:1) loading the ground;
(cid:1) withdrawing support from the ground;
(cid:1) changing fluid and/or gas pressures in the ground.
Thus, the weight of a dam loads the ground, and the excavation of a tunnel with-
draws support from the ground, while pumping water from a well will change fluid
pressures in the ground within the zone of the cone of depression of water levels. Each
process produces a typical reaction as is summarised in Fig. 8.1. This chapter intro-

duces this subject, and succeeding chapters deal with the basic theory of, and describe
reactions that may be expected to, these three engineering processes.
In the case of static loading, the reaction of the ground may include:
(cid:1) elastic deformation of the ground and thus ‘immediate’ settlement of the load-im-
posing structure;
(cid:1) long-term consolidation of the ground and ‘consolidation settlement’ of the struc-
ture;
(cid:1) failure, in shear, of the ground if the foundation pressure exceeds the bearing capac-
ity of the ground.
Similar results will occur if the loading process is dynamic arising, for example,
from manmade vibrations caused by blasting, machinery or traffic, or by earthquakes.
If an excavation is made into the ground, the ground around the excavation loses
the support of the material which has been removed. Surface excavation may be clas-
sified into ‘closed’ or ‘open’ forms, the former being holes completely surrounded by
cut slopes (such as foundation excavations, open pit mines and some quarries) and
the latter being linear cuts through hills with one or possibly two cut slopes (such as
road, railway or canal excavations).
The process of withdrawal of support may result in:
(cid:1) deformation of the excavated slope;
(cid:1) upwards heave of the floor of the excavation;
(cid:1) rotational or sliding failure of the slope.
Support may be withdrawn underground by the excavation of tunnels, chambers
or mines. The results may include:
(cid:1) deformation of the rock surrounding the excavation as this will converge or collapse
into the opening;
(cid:1) subsidence of the surface above the opening as the result of the ground moving in
to fill the void.
Fluid (and/or gas) pressures may be decreased by extraction (pumping out) or in-
creased by addition (pumping in) of fluid. If pore fluid pressures are reduced by pump-
ing out then the effective stress will increase, and the materials will consolidate, re-
sulting in surface subsidence. If fluids are pumped into the ground which is already
under stress then the rise in pore pressure could disturb the balance of stresses and
cause failures, possibly even inducing local seismicity.
In most engineering works more than one of these processes could be active. Thus,
for example, excavating a tunnel portal will withdraw support from a slope, driving
the tunnel underground will withdraw support from the ground surrounding the tun-
nel and, since most tunnels act as drains, will also lower the groundwater table in the
area around the tunnel. In the construction of a dam, the foundation excavation will
either cut new slopes or steepen existing slopes, and unload the ground; building the
dam will re-load the ground, and impounding the reservoir will both load the ground
and raise fluid pressures.
232 CHAPTER 8 · Ground Response to Engineering and Natural Processes
In each of these processes there will be a response. Knowledge of the appropriate
material properties, mass fabric and environmental controls are required to determine
the magnitude and nature of that response.
8.2
Natural Processes
The engineering processes are paralleled by natural processes occurring within the
environment, and through geological time. Thus, in nature, static load results from
the progressive deposition of sediments, or the superposition of snow and ice. Dynamic
loading results from earthquakes. Support may be withdrawn at the land surface by
erosion associated with rivers, the sea or wind and, also (perhaps more importantly)
by the reduction of the strength of materials in a slope as the result of weathering.
Support is withdrawn underground by the solution of limestone, gypsum and salt.
Fluids may be extracted by groundwater changes resulting from river capture, the
exposure and drainage of artesian aquifers, and drought. Fluids may be added by floods,
changes in river courses, and by the impoundment of lakes through landsliding. The
results of the natural processes are, in the general sense, similar to those resulting from
engineering processes although they can tend to be less spectacular, except in the case
of earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and large landslides.
Natural processes operate continuously, whereas the reaction to the engineering
process is generally finished quite soon after the construction of the engineering work.
Thereafter, natural processes operate on the complete work for its total anticipated op-
erational life. Thus a road cut in rock, which is stable on completion, can be influenced
by progressive weathering of the material and discontinuities. Surface erosion by wind
and rainfall runoff, may bring that slope to failure. How long this takes, whether 10 years
or 10000 years, will depend upon the resistance of the rock mass to weathering,
groundwater penetration, erosion and climate.
What the reaction of the ground will be to both engineering and natural processes
can be calculated provided the correct data is obtained. In planning an investigation
in order to obtain that data it is useful to think through the whole programme of con-
struction of a work to see what processes may act and what reactions may possibly
result. A theoretical example of how such a construction project may be ‘thought
through’ is presented in the following section.
8.3
Recognising Problems
The theoretical project is that of a tall office building in an urban area; the design of
the building incorporates a basement for storage and car parking (Fig. 8.2).
The pre-existing buildings on both sides of the proposed office block are of vary-
ing ages. Buildings 1 and 3 are new, Building 4 is modern but older, and Building 2 is
very old, structurally suspect and of importance historically. The desk study carried
out in the project conception stage of the site investigation revealed that the bedrock
in the general area is granite, characterised by some weathering and with numerous
faults and shear zones. The overburden is composed of normally consolidated allu-
vium; groundwater is shallow. Some records regarding the investigations for the adja-
8.3 · Recognising Problems 233
cent modern buildings and the foundations of those buildings are preserved in the
city archives.
Nothing is known about the geological conditions or foundations underneath Build-
ing 2. Records of old boreholes exist for Building 4, and both investigation records and
as-built foundation drawings exist for Buildings 1 and 3. From these data a profile
showing the geology can be drawn (Fig. 8.3). The groundwater level is high in the
medium dense sands and soft to firm clays of the alluvium. The granite appears to be
weathered and has erosion hollows coinciding with fault or shear zones. These hol-
lows appear to be partly filled with coarse granite gravel and sand.
It is most probable that granite underlies the proposed block, and it would also seem
likely that rockhead is somewhat deeper than the bottom of the proposed basement.

ment

234 CHAPTER 8 · Ground Response to Engineering and Natural Processes
When the work goes forward it must inevitably start with an excavation for the base-
ment, thus withdrawing support from the surrounding ground.
For many foundation excavations the problem is one of the stability of the exca-
vated slope. This may be cut to an inclination at which the slope is stable. However, to
calculate what the appropriate slope angle might be requires a knowledge of the
geotechnical properties of the materials within the slope. In this particular case, the
slope must be near-vertical because of the presence of the adjacent buildings, and the
soil assumed to be present will inevitably be too weak to stand at such an angle. The
slope must, therefore, be supported in some way. In order to design the support sys-
tem it is necessary to know not only the geotechnical properties of the ground but also
the foundation loads imposed by the nearby buildings, and the type, depth, and con-
dition of the foundations upon which they are based. Depending on the nature of the
alluvium, heave in the bottom of the foundation excavation could be a problem.
Assuming that the foundation excavation can be carried out successfully the cast
concrete foundation will load the ground. As the structure is built so the additional
weight will be transferred into the ground. It is essential to determine the depth to the
top of the granite, for the alluvium below the proposed basement will be unable to
support the building because failure and/or major settlement are probable. That load
must be transferred down into the granite. Depending on the depth of the granite the
foundations may have to extend below the planned bottom of the basement to reach
the granite. This would exacerbate the problem of lateral support for the excavated
slope will become higher. Also, as the granite is weathered, the bearing capacity of the
near-rockhead granite may be suspect. There could, nevertheless, be a bonus in that a
deeper excavation might provide an additional basement level.
The high water table and the pervious nature of some of the granular alluvial soils
indicates that water will drain into the excavation and, as a result, changes in ground-
water pressures will have a strong influence on the problems of excavated slope sta-
bility. The water will have to be pumped out from the excavation to permit construc-
tion to proceed. As a result the water table will be lowered around the excavation and
this will in turn reduce the fluid pressures, resulting in consolidation of the alluvial
soils under the surrounding buildings which are not founded on the granite. As a re-
sult severe settlement damage could take place. Such damage might be overcome by
providing a watertight support system surrounding the excavation, by pumping wa-
ter back into the surrounding ground (‘artificial recharge’) or by carrying out shallow
grouting to compensate for the settlement. Therefore, the flow of water through the
alluvium and the underlying granite into the excavation is a likely consequence of the
excavation. Possible hydraulic connections within and between the granite and the
alluvium, and the distribution of water within the granite are, therefore, factors of
importance.
An additional problem to add to these difficulties is the possibility that a tunnelled
metro system may be installed, at some unspecified time in the future, beneath the
whole area, and within the granite. How will such a development affect the completed
building, and how will the then-existing buildings affect the metro?
Having recognised at least some of the problems in this project (the reader is of-
fered, and left, with the opportunity to discover some more) consideration may be given
to the form of site investigation which would be appropriate for the new building.
8.4 · Groundwater 235
Factors which would have to be taken into account in the design of the investigation
would be:
(cid:1) the geotechnical properties and distribution of the various types of alluvium, includ-
ing such factors as permeability, shear strength and consolidation parameters;
(cid:1) the depth to the granite and the shape of the bedrock surface;
(cid:1) the nature and depth of weathering of the granite, its strength and mass permeabil-
ity;
(cid:1) groundwater levels in the various strata;
(cid:1) the nature, depth and condition of the foundations of the adjacent buildings, and
the distribution and character of the strata in which the foundations were placed;
(cid:1) future plans with regard to the metro.
Critical factors will be the depth and shape of the rockhead surface, a basic idea of
the properties of the alluvium and knowledge of the foundations of the adjacent build-
ings. If the granite is too deep, the alluvium too weak and deformable, and the adja-
cent buildings of uncertain nature and construction quality, then it may be consid-
ered prudent to modify the design and omit the basement. However, new structures
have been built in conditions such as those described, so a review of the published
literature of such construction in other cities (i.e. Case Histories) could be rewarding.
Accordingly, it would be a good idea to start the first stage of intrusive investigation
with one high quality borehole, obtaining samples for inspection and testing of all the
materials present, and installing a multi-tip piezometer system to measure pore pres-
sures with depth and time. It will also be necessary to locate the shape of the granite
rockhead. In rural conditions, or where there was no background interference, seis-
mic refraction or ground-penetrating radar could be appropriate methods but, in a
built-up area, the use of a number of probe boreholes would be more suitable.
Depending on the results of this preliminary investigation, the feasibility of the whole
project may be reviewed. If construction of the intended structure, including the base-
ment, seem possible, then the main investigation, to study the ground conditions of
the site in the surrounding area and in depth, should be carried out.
8.4
Groundwater
The perceptive reader will have realised that many of the natural and engineering pro-
cessed mentioned so far, together with their responses, will involve a change in fluid
pressure (Fig. 8.1). The fluid most normally involved is groundwater. Hydrogeology is
a huge subject on its own but one which engineering geologists must appreciate in
practice for the following reasons: groundwater will influence all engineering work
below the water table, groundwater will invariably seep and flow into an excavation
below the water table unless stringent measures are undertaken to exclude it, and the
predictions made to forecast such flows are invariably wrong, despite the fearsome
nature of the mathematics employed in their calculation.
Therefore, in order to consider adequately the consequences of any engineering
process in terms of the ground’s reaction to them, it is necessary to consider the role of
236 CHAPTER 8 · Ground Response to Engineering and Natural Processes
groundwater in those processes and reactions. Here, four elements of the vocabulary
used in hydrogeology need to be explained:
1. watertable: the level of standing water in the ground;
2. aquifer: ground through which water flows at rates of significance to engineering
works (aquifers are described as unconfined if their upper surface is ground level
and confined if they are covered – or “confined” – by less permeable material);
3. aquitard: ground through which water does not flow at such a rate;
4. hydrogeological boundary: a surface (bedding, fault, etc.) that separates ground of
different hydrogeological character.
8.4.1
Common Problems With Groundwater in Engineering
Engineering below the water table needs to cope with the pressure of water at depth
and the flows of water that can be encountered, especially into and around or beneath
the engineering structure itself.
Water Pressure
Most of the common problems are associated with water pressure, some of which are
illustrated in Fig. 8.4. Figure 8.4a shows what might be considered the starting point
for all slope stability calculations, the rock block on a sloping surface. When dry, sta-
bility depends on friction between surface and block and block weight, but if the back-
ing joint is filled with water, water pressure thrusts the block down slope and, if water
flows under the block, uplift pressures result, which reduce the normal load on the
surface and hence the frictional resistance the weight of the block can generate.
In soil slopes or very large slopes in rock, where rotational failure is possible
(Fig. 8.4b) water pressures generated by groundwater reduce potential stability. When
a reservoir is impounded behind a dam water pressure acting on the back of the dam
(Fig. 8.4c) will tend to push the dam downstream. This could lead to failure if the rock
foundation contains unfavourably orientated weak layers or discontinuities. If water
flows under the dam (Fig. 8.4d), this will give rise to uplift pressures, further reducing
dam stability. Example (d) may be considered as nothing more than an elaboration of (a).
Figure 8.4e shows an excavation being made in soil over a layer of low permeabil-
ity rock, an aquitard, which confines ground containing water under pressure. Before
the excavation was made the soil pressure above was sufficient to balance the pres-
sure of water at depth. However, as the excavation is deepened confining pressure is
reduced and the point may be reached when it is less than the water pressure trapped
beneath it. This unbalanced pressure can rupture the layer that confines it and very
rapid, often catastrophic, water inflows occur.
Excavations may be made to depths below water table level (for structures such as
dry docks, underground car parks, underpass roads and the like) by lowering the water
table level or excluding water from the excavation. The finished structure will be wa-
tertight and, once completed, the water table will return to normal levels imposing
uplift forces on the structure (Fig. 8.4f). These may have to be resisted by anchorages
or tension piles.
8.4 · Groundwater 237
Fig. 8.4. Examples of significance of water pressures on engineering structures
In each example except (b) the water pressure is acting against a more-or-less im-
permeable surface but in (b) the water pressures are intergranular pore pressures. Pore
pressures may be increased in many different ways to the point where they cause fail-
ure. Thus, for example, saturated fine sands may liquefy because of excessive pore
pressures generated by earthquake tremors. In the construction of embankments ex-
238 CHAPTER 8 · Ground Response to Engineering and Natural Processes
cessive compaction without allowing time for drainage may raise pore pressures to
levels threatening embankment stability.
Water Inflow
Any engineering works carried out below the level of the water table will encounter
groundwater inflow towards them. The rate of flow will depend upon the size and depth
of the excavation and the hydrogeological properties of the rocks and soils involved, both
in the excavation and in the surrounding area. Dealing with the water inflow, or alterna-
tively, adopting some means of excluding it wholly or in part, may involve major expense.
Inflow of water into excavations may cause flooding of the excavation, collapse of
the sides and “boiling” of the floor. Except in the case of small inflows which may be
dealt with by pumping from a sump or collector trench, it will be necessary either to
drain or de-water the area, preferably before excavation begins. Any method which
allows temporary lowering of the water table may be adopted.
8.4.2
Theory of Groundwater Lowering
Pumping water from the ground produces a cone of depression in the water table or
piezometric surface (Fig. 8.5). The radius and gradient of the cone depends upon the
rate of pumping, the storage of the ground and the hydraulic conductivity which de-
termines the rate at which water flows towards the pumping well.
Fig. 8.5. Cones of depression of water level or piezometric level due to water extraction
8.4 · Groundwater 239
The amount of discharge Q which would be necessary to lower the water table
through a given depth to achieve a steady state of flow can be estimated from:
(8.1)
Equation 8.1 is for an unconfined aquifer, Fig. 8.5a, where h is the elevation of the
2
water table above an impermeable horizon at r measured in an observation hole, and
2
h is the height of water above the same impermeable horizon at r and K is the hy-
1 1
draulic conductivity.
For a confined aquifer, Fig. 8.5b, the equation is:
(8.2)
where b is the saturated thickness of the aquifer.
Well Points
The simplest method of de-watering is by the use of a well point system (Fig. 8.5c), which
consists of a number of perforated pipes placed vertically in the ground, usually by
“jetting” and connected together by a “ring main” hose which in turn leads to a pump.
The depth to which the pipes are placed and the spacing between them depends upon
hydrogeological conditions. The pipes must be close enough to allow intersection of
individual cones of depression produced in the water table by pumping. Generally, the
maximum depression of the water table which can be achieved in practice is about 5 m.
Bored Wells
These may be used when a depression of more than 5 m is required, or when the water
has to be pumped from depth. Since these require installation of submersible pumps in
properly drilled and screened wells, they are very much more expensive than well points.
Horizontal Drains
Drainage tubes may be installed on benches if this becomes necessary after excava-
tion work has started. The drains are drilled to intersect the water table and have a
slight inclination towards the excavation. Water emerging from them must still be
pumped out of the excavation. They are useful particularly for the drainage of slopes,
240 CHAPTER 8 · Ground Response to Engineering and Natural Processes
rather than for excavations. If the slopes are in rock then attention must be given to
the direction of the drainage holes to make sure that they intercept those joints through
which water may be flowing.
8.4.3
Excluding Water
Excavations in “dry” conditions may be made by excluding water from the excavation.
Sheet piles may be used to create an impermeable barrier to water inflow. The piles
may be bored or driven, usually concrete in the case of bored piles, usually steel if
driven (Fig. 8.6). Preferably, the piles should be placed to an impermeable stratum
below the depth of the excavation. Otherwise the hydraulic head between the water
table outside the excavation and the floor of the excavation could cause sufficient flow
of water up through the floor to cause quicksand conditions in soils.
If the piles cannot be placed to an impermeable layer, they should be placed deep
enough so that the flow path of water underneath them is lengthened to reduce the
flow into the bottom of the excavation. Sheet piles have the advantage that they can be
used in any type of soil except boulder beds. Steel piles may be recovered for re-use; if
a contiguous pile concrete wall is used, it may become part of whatever structure is
placed in the excavation.
Grouting
Grouting may be used in porous and permeable media to create an impermeable grout
curtain. The site is surrounded by closely spaced drill holes, into which is pumped
grout. Usually a mixture of cement with bentonite is used since this has the necessary
properties of mobility when fluid and impermeability when set. Grout curtains are

flow around them and into the excavation may be sufficient to cause quicksand conditions in the exca-
vation
8.4 · Groundwater 241
never impermeable after the first grouting. Variations in the groundmass and errors
with grouting procedure result in poorly grouted zones through which leakage will
occur. Remedial grouting, sometimes three or more times, is mostly necessary to cre-
ate a fully impermeable curtain.
Diaphragm walls
Diaphragm walls may be constructed to exclude groundwater if these can be used as
part of the permanent works. They are constructed of structural concrete and may be
formed in a trench filled with bentonite slurry. In some cases the slurry trench will be
enough on its own to exclude groundwater.
Freezing
Freezing of the groundwater is an expensive but extremely effective technique for ex-
cluding water. Usually, brine at –30°C is pumped through a ring of double pipes in-
stalled in boreholes. The returned brine, at a temperature of perhaps –27°C is refrig-
erated and re-circulated. Several weeks may be necessary before an impermeable ice
wall is formed and the freeze has to be maintained until the excavation is lined or the
foundation works completed. It is important to realise that water has to be present (it
is the water that is being frozen) at the time and location of the freezing pipes before
excavation starts. Otherwise only a temperature lowering is obtained and when water
levels rise, an influx of (warmer) water may not be turned into ice and reach the exca-
vation.
8.4.4
Inflow into Tunnels
With regard to groundwater, planning and construction of a tunnel must take account
of the following:
(cid:1) amounts and locations of water inflow into the tunnel during construction;
(cid:1) effect on surface structures of the possible withdrawal of support by water table low-
ering during tunnel construction;
(cid:1) affect of the interaction between water in the finished tunnel, if it is to be an aque-
duct, and the prevailing external hydrogeological regime; and
(cid:1) effect of hydrostatic pressure on the tunnel lining.
Prediction of amounts and locations of inflows are of extreme importance, not only
for cost but from the safety point of view. Many disasters suffered during tunnel con-
struction have been the direct consequence of the unexpected interception of large wa-
ter inflows.
Drainage systems can be designed only when inflows can be predicted. Tunnels
driven upgrade will serve as their own primary drainage system, but the hazard to
workers of sudden inrushes of water will remain. These may be brought about by the
tunnel passing through a hydrogeological boundary, of which the most dangerous may
be faults. Tunnels driven down-grade or from access shafts are more difficult to drain
242 CHAPTER 8 · Ground Response to Engineering and Natural Processes
and the hazard is increased. Inflows at the tunnel face of 1000 litres per second have
been recorded in several instances (Goodman et al. 1965).
Figure 8.7a shows a tunnel acting as a drain in a homogeneous isotropic medium.
Such a simple case may occur in shallow tunnels driven in unconfined aquifers in non-
lithified sediments. The rate of water inflow Q, that might be expected, per unit length
of tunnel is given by:
(8.3)
where K=hydraulic conductivity, h =depth from water table to tunnel and r=radius
0
of tunnel. Alternatively, an elementary flow net can be constructed, from which Q can
be calculated.
This simple case is unlikely in a rock mass, even if the improbable assumption of
mass isotropy and homogeneity is continued, because after some time t, the water table
will be drawn down, the original conditions will no longer exist, and a transient flow
system would develop quickly (Fig. 8.7b). In this case, the rate of inflow Q(t) per unit
length of tunnel at any time t after the water level had been reduced to the level of the
tunnel can be approximated by:
(8.4)
where S is the specific yield, and C is an arbitrary constant, found by experiment, to
have a value of approximately 0.75.
Thus, it is clear that the present state of the art is capable only of giving order of
magnitude values to predictions of inflow. A pre-requisite to increased accuracy in in-
flow prediction is obviously a greatly increased knowledge of the geological condi-
tions. Unfortunately, this is extremely difficult to achieve, particularly for a tunnel
Fig. 8.7. Water influx into a tunnel
8.4 · Groundwater 243
which is to be driven at depth through an area which has a complicated and rapidly
changing geological structure.
Some improvement can be made by increasing the accuracy of geological knowl-
edge and carrying out calculations similar to the above for each “geological unit” of
the tunnel. For example, different rock types may provide a primary “geological unit”
division; ideally hydrogeological boundaries should be used to define these units as
they bound ground of similar hydraulic characters. For each primary division, subdi-
vision could be made on the basis of fracture density and orientation, taking particu-
lar account of areas where fracture density would be expected to increase due to fault-
ing and/or anticlinal folding.
Example
Figure 8.8. gives a theoretical example to illustrate lines of thought that may be adopted
to consider such problems. The geological section has been developed from surface
geological mapping and shows faulted but uniformly dipping sedimentary rocks in-
truded by a granite batholith and basalt dyke (the dyke is shown rather thicker than is
likely in nature).
The first problem is the nature of the fault. Faults may be thin impermeable
hydrogeological barriers or could possibly be wide with permeable crush zones. In
the first case the fault would be a limited hazard but in the second a major danger,
allowing the sandstone aquifer to discharge into the tunnel under 250 m hydraulic head.
Clearly the nature and permeability of the fault would deserve further attention dur-
ing the course of detailed site investigation, remembering that the condition of the
fault would not necessarily be uniform but vary depending on the nature of the strata
through which it passes.
Because of its chilled margin adjacent to metamorphosed rock the outer sur-
faces of the basalt could act as a barrier to water flow from the karstic limestone,
while well developed internal jointing could act as a conduit to channel water into
the tunnel. Alternatively the basalt could be a partial barrier sufficient to allow
impoundment of water in the limestone but allowing passage of water into the dyke
to give high hydraulic head in the basalt. Groundwater conditions in both the lime-
stone and basalt would deserve investigation. Little inflow might be anticipated in
mudstone but rather more in the granite through widely spaced, perhaps part open,
joints.

Such geological studies in practice would be three dimensional involving the in-
terpretation of a wide zone of mapping around the tunnel line, and be followed up by
physical investigation designed to better define the problems revealed by geological
studies. Joint aperture at depth is difficult to estimate but in folded structures zones
of potential difficulty may be recognised. In stronger rocks there may be a greater fre-
quency of joints, perhaps with wider apertures, around fold axes (Fig. 8.9). Any tun-
nel passing through a fold axis might expect greater water inflow in such locations.
8.4.5
Water Outflow
Some excavations, such as canals, small reservoirs and landfill sites, are intended to
keep water or fluids in and in such cases this is usually achieved by constructing some
sort of impervious, water retaining, lining. Reservoirs behind dams generally rely upon
geological conditions to achieve this and, before constructing a dam, studies are un-
dertaken to assess where and how much leakage may take place from the reservoir.
This will depend upon the nature of the strata, whether the river to be dammed is in-
fluent or effluent, hydrogeological boundaries and variations in water table level within
the strata surrounding the reservoir.
8.4.6
Links to Rock Mass Classification
In fractured masses the quantity and rate of flow will to some degree depend upon
fracture aperture and roughness. The former, being related to mass porosity, will in-
fluence quantity. It is well known that roughness of pipe surfaces reduces flow so the
latter will influence rate of flow through the rock mass. Factors such as aperture and
joint roughness are used in rock mass classifications for tunnelling and other purposes.
Gates (1997) has utilised rock mass classification procedures to evaluate the ground-
water potential in fractured bedrock. The derived parameter is the Hydro-Potential
value (HP ), which is given by:

Clearly the factors quoted owe much to Barton et al. (1974) but ratings have been
selected or modified by Gates as appropriate to the purpose. Data to complete the equa-
tion was derived from the examination of outcrops close to a series of wells. The rock
masses examined were mostly igneous or volcanic.

Conclusion
The following chapters consider the processes described in Fig. 8.1 and their responses
in ground that would normally contain groundwater. When a site investigation is ei-
ther being designed or conducted, the engineering geologist has to foresee those pro-
cesses and reactions that may be associated with a project, so that the information
required for such reactions to be quantified is obtained.

Withdrawal of Support by Surface Excavations
9.1
Slope Movements
When support to the ground is withdrawn by surface excavation, a slope results. The
excavation can be brought about either by natural agencies (such as river erosion,
coastal erosion) or by man-made process (such as the excavations for railways roads
and canals). If the slope formed is too steep to be supported by the strength of the
ground in the sides of excavation then the slope will fail as a landslide.
Engineers find it convenient to divide slope failures into two sorts; first time
(i.e. involving ground that has never failed before) and reactivated (i.e. remobilising
a slide that had stopped moving). In the field it is often the case that these may appear
as three types of landslide:
1. the natural mass movements of a slope as a consequence of erosion and weathering
processes, (these could be either first time or reactivated);
2. the reactivation of old landslides on natural slopes as a result of human activities
(such as cutting into a slope, building on a slope or changing the groundwater move-
ment pattern within a slope) or possibly natural erosion by downcutting of rivers;
and
3. the failure of cut slopes in otherwise unfailed ground, as a consequence of imper-
fect design or construction.
The possibility of landsliding is an ever present danger in any construction in hilly
country. Much loss of material and life is caused each year by landsliding.
The growth of many cities has been inhibited by slope stability problems as they
grew from a small riverside settlement to spread up the valley sides. An example of
this is the city of Bath in Southern England, which was founded in Roman times on
the alluvial flats of the River Avon (Kellaway and Taylor 1968). The area about the
city consists of Jurassic rocks in which sandstones and limestones (of the Oolite
Series) overlie shales and clays (of the Lias). The higher rocks form escarpments which
have sometimes slid as the result of failure of the underlying shales and clays, per-
haps following their softening by weathering. Many old landslides are present. The
city of Bath has grown beyond the first area of settlement and has spread over the
landslipped and potentially unstable areas, which give great problems in building con-
struction.

Simple Slope Failure
Surface excavations by natural or engineering processes leave a slope whose stability
is related to the slope angle, the strength of the materials and discontinuities in the
slope and the groundwater situation. In Fig. 9.1 the simplest example of slope failure
is considered, that of a block of rock resting, or perhaps sliding down, on an inclined
discontinuity. The analysis of this situation is the basis of calculations for all types of
slope stability problems. The cohesion (c), the angle of shearing resistance (ϕ) between
the basal plane on which sliding movement may take place and the overlying block, the
angle of slope (β) which is also, in this case, the dip of the basal discontinuity, the area of
the base of the block (A) and the weight of the block (W) are the factors contributing to
stability in dry conditions.
At limiting equilibrium the forces promoting movement equal the forces resisting
movement

If open joints behind the block become filled with water which thence flows under
the base of the block, the stability of the block is reduced by the uplift force (U) on the
base of the block and forward thrust (V) from water in the joint.

Fig. 9.1. The stability of a rock
block on a slope
may give water pressures of significance to stability. These water pressures may be
transient and apply only when rainfall is occurring and the build up of water pressure
may be dependent upon the intensity of rainfall, relative to the drainage capacity of
the rockface. Figure 9.2 shows four possible conditions of a slope. In (a) the slope is
dry and in (b), the “free draining” slope, the permeability is sufficiently large to pre-
vent significant water pressures building up as the result of transient infiltration from
rainfall of limited intensity. In (c) the rainfall has increased to fill the discontinuities
but free drainage occurs from the toe of the block. Here the water pressure, the distri-
bution of which is represented by the shape of the shaded trapezoids, may build up
sufficiently to cause failure. In (d) the toe seepage is obstructed, perhaps by ice or soil
infill, to allow the water pressure to build up still further.
Thus the possible failure of this type of slope as a consequence of water pressures
depends on a combination of circumstances. For example, a slope which has been stable
for many years could fail due to exceptionally heavy rainfall or due to ice developing
on the face in an unusually severe winter.
Sliding blocks do exist in nature but most slopes are more irregular in shape. How-
ever, the failure process by sliding on a discontinuity is the same as that of the sliding
block, except that the shape of the ‘block’ is more complex. This is the most common
mode of failure in rocks where masses translate down slope on well defined surfaces,

Fig. 9.2. The development of water pressures in a rock slope
although it can occur in soils, for example, in older clays that contain shear zones from
tectonic movements or previous landslides.
Many slopes have been observed to fail along approximately circular slip surfaces
so that the moving mass rotates. These rotational slips occur mostly in soils but may
occur in weak rocks or in very large rock slopes. The curved slip surface of a rota-
tional failure cuts through intact material and is curved as a consequence of the dis-
tribution of stress in the slope. A classical experiment was carried out in 1940 to illus-
trate the failure of a vertical cut (Harroun 1940). In this experiment (Fig. 9.3) gelatine
was poured and allowed to set between two vertical glass plates in a box and held as a
vertical cut in horizontal ‘ground’ by a temporary support. Gelatine was used because
of its low strength, its property of losing strength with increasing temperature and
because of its photoelastic properties. By using these last properties it was possible to
observe the development of stress in, and the deformation of, the model.
To begin the experiment the temporary support was removed and the model im-
mediately slumped from position 1 (with the support) to position 2. The vertical wall
bulged outwards at its base while the ground surface level fell. Photoelastic analysis
indicated the development of a curved surface of shear failure, leading to the toe of
the cut. The temperature of the model was then raised so that the gelatine became
weaker. The model slumped to position 3, in which tension cracks on the ground sur-
face appeared. Material began to flow out of the toe of the cut. A further increase in
temperature produced stage 4, in which sliding occurred on the curved failure surface

gelatine model to simulate the
stages of a slope (from Harroun

tensile strains come from al-
most contemporary work by
Terzaghi
and the toe of the cut flowed forward. The idea of the experiment was to simulate the
effect of increasing the effective height of the cut by decreasing the strength of the
material. However, the decrease in strength of the model material also simulates loss
of strength due to weathering, the opening of fissures, general disruption of structure
etc. which many materials experience once slope movement (as in stage 2) begins.
Later experiments on similar materials measured tensile strain (and thence stress)
on the surface (σ in the figure). Maximum stress occurred at a distance of about half
t
the height of the cut from its edge; the point of maximum tensile stress is the point of
development of the tension crack. The slope deformations shown in these experiments
on the model have been observed by the author on slopes in rock and soil.

The Stability of Slopes in Soil
9.3.1
Dry Slopes in Granular Soils
Materials with no cohesion, such as sands and gravels, are frequently known as granular
materials. A slope in such materials inclined at angle β to the horizontal may be con-
sidered to be composed of a series of sliding blocks, whose stability is described by
Eq. 9.3. Because the granular material has no cohesion,

where φ=the angle of shearing resistance of the soil.
At equilibrium, F =1 and β=φ.
s
9.3.2
Seepage Parallel to Slope
Equation 9.6 shows that the stability of the slope depends upon β and φ. The weight
has no influence either in the dry or the totally submerged condition. However, if there
is seepage in the slope, giving a water table below the surface, then water pressures
252 CHAPTER 9 · Withdrawal of Support by Surface Excavations
will reduce its stability. Such a case might arise if a pit is dug through granular mate-
rials to below the water table level. If the water is then pumped out rapidly seepage
pressures in the slope could bring it to failure. Coastal slopes in granular materials
have to be designed to allow for seepage pressures developed by tidal sea level changes.
9.3.3
Rotational Failure
Most slopes in cohesive soils fail totally or partially in rotation. The failure surface cuts
through intact soil and has the approximate shape of the arc of a circle. Failure, or the
potential for failure, may be analysed in various ways.
One of these ways has been to divide up the slope into a series of sliding blocks
(Fig. 9.4), the base of each being a small part of the arc which, for analysis, is taken to
be straight line. The weight of the block depends upon its height and the density of
the material in it. Resistance to movement depends upon the shear strength of the base
of the block and the support (Y ) of the downslope block; the forces promoting move-
u
ment are the downslope component of the block’s weight and the down slope push
(Y ) of the upslope block. For the whole slope to move in rotation each block would
d
have develop forces (X and X ) along its vertical sides in order to move relative to
u d
adjacent blocks.
If the influence of X and Y forces is ignored the factor of safety of the slope, F, is
s
(9.7)
Of course, as in the sliding block analysis, if water emerges from the slope water
pressures will act on the blocks, reducing factors of safety. Thus for example, rapid
drawdown of water in an excavation will give a curved water table within the slope,
introducing water pressures. Alternatively a new slope, showing some seepage, may
be stable in the dry season but a rise in water table level in the wet season may bring
about failure.

lysed by the method of slices
9.3 · The Stability of Slopes in Soil 253
Should all the soil in the slope be uniform saturated clay under undrained condi-
tions (φ=0), moment equilibrium is considered in the analysis along a failure surface
assumed to be a circular arc. A trial failure surface (centre 0, radius r and length L) is
shown in the figure (Fig. 9.5). Potential instability is due to the total weight of the soil
mass (W) above the failure surface. For such a slope, as for all other slopes
(9.8)
but, because the failure surface is the arc of a circle, forces may be expressed as mo-
ments about the centre of the circle. Thus:
(9.9)
where c is the undrained shear strength of the clay. This total stress analysis may be
u
held to pertain to the case of a slope in saturated clay soil immediately after construc-
tion.
This method of analysis is of limited value in that it can deal only with uniform
soils and groundwater conditions. Consequently the analysis based on block move-
ment (the Swedish or Fellenius method of slices) is the most widely used analysis tech-
nique. In block movement analysis, as in rock masses, the plane on which movement
may take place is known from discontinuity studies, the unit weight of rock materials
is usually more or less uniform, and water movement governed by discontinuities.
However, in soils, unit weights, shear strength parameters, permeabilities and degrees
of saturation may vary significantly from soil layer to soil layer. Thus, no single analy-
sis of an assumed rotational failure surface in a slope is sufficient to determine the
lowest factor of safety. It is necessary to analyse the slope for a number of trial failure
arcs about different circle centres in order to determine the minimum factor of safety.

slope in clay
254 CHAPTER 9 · Withdrawal of Support by Surface Excavations
When the analysis methods described above were devised a stability analysis us-
ing slide rules, logarithms or mechanical calculators was a massive undertaking re-
quiring many days work, during which one had the opportunity to think about the
slope and its analyses – if only to relieve the tedium of repeated calculations. Today
computer programmes complete the calculations in seconds and the analysis requires
little time or effort; the time so saved seems rarely to be given to reviewing the slope.
It is essential to put the correct data into the calculation. Thus, in the layered soil
depicted in Fig. 9.6a the shear strength parameters and unit weights of each layer must
be determined by investigation to allow the stability analysis of the slope to be made.
Groundwater levels are of particular importance. Layers with significantly different
properties may control the location of the slip circle which could emerge on the slope
or beyond the foot of the slope (Fig. 9.6a). It may be noted from Fig. 9.4 that slices a, b
and c, to the left of the failure arc act to resist the downward movement of the main
soil mass. Should attempts be made to cut away at the bottom of the slope, this resis-
tance will be diminished; failure could result. Total removal of the slope toe is not nec-

tions which will influence soil

9.3 · The Stability of Slopes in Soil 255
essary to give problems. If a continuous trench is dug at the foot of the slope, if only as
a temporary measure to, say, insert a drain, this may isolate part of the mass resisting
movement from that promoting movement and bring about failure. This can be sig-
nificant in highway slope design.
A slope might fail from other causes. The ground in Fig. 9.6b contains a water bearing
sand layer. When the slope is excavated water will discharge from this layer bringing sand
with it and undercutting the upper part of the slope. Any change in permeability between
layers which gives rise to seepage on the slope could bring about this form of failure.
Perhaps the greatest hazard is that of the old landslide. Figure 9.6c shows a slope which
failed and, from its hummocky shape was clearly a landslide. With time and erosion
the slope becomes more gentle, but contains the shear surfaces under and within the mass
which moved. The stability of any new slope excavated in this ground will depend not only
on the strength of the slope materials but also on that of the shear surfaces included in it.
Not all soil slides are rotational. In many areas soil, either deposited or residual,
overlies rock at shallow depth. If rockhead slopes then, perhaps in wet periods, trans-
lational soil slips over rockhead may occur. Should these extend upwards into thicker
soils then undercutting may bring about rotational failures in the soils above.
9.3.4
The Stability of Tips and Spoil Heaps
Tips and spoil heaps are man-made and often carelessly constructed. They may occur
in industrial areas and the manner and rapidity with which any failure may take place
is of considerable importance. The problem of the stability of tips and spoil heaps was
brought to public attention with dramatic force in 1966 by the disaster at Aberfan, when a
slide involving only some 140000 m3 of colliery rubbish resulted in the loss of 144 lives.
Not only to the public, but also to the most professional engineers and geologists –
even to those concerned with mining – it came as a problem to which they had given
little, if any, serious attention. It would appear that in most respects the problems en-
countered with tips and spoil heaps are similar in many ways to engineering construc-
tions, such as road and railway embankments and water retaining structures. How-
ever, unlike fills for engineering purposes, most mining waste was placed, until recently,
without compaction. Slurry and tailings in settling lagoons are likewise in a similar
loose state of packing. Often the material in tips and spoil heaps may contain much
moisture. There is thus a risk that any slip may develop into a rapidly moving mois-
ture laden flowslide or mudflow. Ordinary rotational landslides involving the relatively
slow movement of soil masses may cause damage to services and properties, but sel-
dom involve loss of life. The greatest danger lies in the subsequent development of
the moving mass into a swiftly moving flowslide or mudflow which may give a disas-
ter with many casualties.
The failure of tailings dams, leading to the discharge of their semi-liquid contents
as mudflows may be equally disastrous. Bight (1997) discusses some disasters, includ-
ing one in Italy causing nearly 300 deaths. It appears that escaping tailings are likely
to move as far as a mudflow if the ground on which they move is wet. On dry ground
movement may be restricted.
256 CHAPTER 9 · Withdrawal of Support by Surface Excavations
9.4
Slopes in Rock
If the limiting vertical height of a slope in a weak limestone is calculated on the basis
of its unconfined compressive strength, values of the order of 100 m may be obtained.
Very few, if any, slopes of this height are to be seen in such materials and observations
of slope failures in all types of rock have demonstrated their association with geological
discontinuities such as faults, joints and bedding planes. Observation also demonstrates
that the parameters of importance when considering the role of discontinuities in slope
failures are their strength; their orientation; their persistence and their frequency and
the geometry and orientation of these discontinuities in the slope.
There may also be permanent seepages from slopes, which are present most sea-
sons of the year and indicate the ‘spring-line’ from a permanent groundwater table.
Up thrust pressures from such a water table will influence stability. New slopes cut in
the dry season may be stable when the groundwater table is low, but become unstable
if, in the rainy season, the water table rises (Fig.9.2).
9.4.1
The Strength of Discontinuities
To complete the basic slope stability equation given in Eq. 9.1 values of c and ϕ must
be obtained. However, as described in Chap. 3, values of ϕ are dependant on the rough-
ness of, and stress upon, the discontinuity surface. Samples of discontinuity surfaces
may be tested in the laboratory and in the field but there will always be some uncer-
tainty that the roughness examined on the scale of the test will be the same as that at
full scale. Also there is no guarantee that a discontinuity tested is representative of all the
discontinuities in that set. This is particularly the case if the discontinuity is an inte-
gral discontinuity, such as a bedding plane or foliation plane, for these are not necessar-
ily uniform as a result of their genesis and may be selectively and irregularly weathered.
General assessments of the strength for particular discontinuities in a particular
rock type may be obtained by the study of failures and by back analysis. The back
analysis process is illustrated in Fig. 9.7. The investigator must first find a rockslide
that has occurred along a discontinuity (perhaps of a particular type) in the rock mass.
The existing profile is surveyed and the profile before the landslide is reconstructed
by surveying adjacent slopes. The weight of the rock mass which moved is estimated
from the geological profile and from measurements of unit weight on rock samples.
Fig. 9.7. A profile for back
analysis
9.4 · Slopes in Rock 257
Water seepages are noted. It is then assumed that the estimated rock block had a fac-
tor of safety of 1.0 at failure and that there was no cohesion on the failure plane. The
standard analysis procedures are then used to determine ϕ. This value of ϕ (which
may contain ‘i’ or even some allowance for cohesion) can then be used for the analysis
of slopes resting on discontinuities of a similar geological character.
This technique is difficult to use for examples of slope failures may be scarce and
the exact circumstances surrounding the actual failure (whether the tension crack was
water-filled or not, for example) are almost impossible to establish. However the
method can be very powerful in the case of open mine slopes for there the original
ground profile before failure and the circumstances around the actual failure should
both be known. A mine is often a long-term project and the faces are often designed
for minimal stability. It follows then that as the mine progresses a number of failures
will occur in the temporary faces. If these are back analysed, quite realistic values of
strength parameters may be calculated and then used for the design of slopes for which
long-term stability is required. If necessary, slope failures can be induced by toe exca-
vation and then back analysed. However, this is a rather hazardous procedure.
Another approach is to also analyse rock slopes, or components of rock slopes, that
have not failed, but assuming that they are about to fail. Such an analysis may give
conservative values of strength parameters to be compared with those from labora-
tory test results and back analyses of failures.
It is usually assumed that strength parameter values are uniform and independent
of discontinuity orientation. This is not necessarily true, particularly in the case of
shear planes, which may be present in rock and soil masses as the result of past or
other shearing motions (such as shearing induced by moving glaciers). These shear
planes may be slickensided with ridged lineations which follow the direction of shear-
ing. In such cases the strength of the discontinuity will be less in the direction of the
lineations than in other directions and the direction of maximum weakness of the
discontinuity will not necessarily be that of this maximum dip (Fig. 9.8).
9.4.2
Modes of Failure
Three common modes of failure may be observed in rock slopes, namely plane, wedge
and toppling failure (Fig. 9.9); each involves sliding on a discontinuity as a failure
mechanism.
Plane Failure
Slope failure by the movement of a mass of rock along a single discontinuity is de-
scribed as ‘plane failure’ or ‘translational failure’ as such a mass on such a plane trans-
lates from its origin to its resting place. This is the case of the totally isolated rock block
sitting on a discontinuity, a situation seldom met in reality. Sliding failure from a long
continuous rock slope is often contained by ‘release surfaces’ which may allow the mass
to move down dip along the basal plane. Figure 9.10 shows release surfaces which by
their orientation may allow, or inhibit, plane failure. Even if orientated to allow move-
ment they may be bonded to the potential moving block and influence its stability,
but this influence is almost impossible to assess in practice.

ern which parts of a long slope
may give plane failure
In order that sliding should occur on a single plane in dry conditions, the follow-
ing geometrical conditions must be satisfied:
i The plane on which sliding occurs must strike parallel or nearly parallel (within
approximately ±20°) to the slope face.
ii The failure plane must ‘daylight’ on the slope face; this means that its dip must be
smaller than the dip of the slope face and that its position in the slope causes it to
intercept the slope face.
iii The dip of the failure plane must be greater than the angle of internal friction on
this plane.
iv Release surfaces which provide negligible resistance to sliding must be present in
the rock mass to define the lateral boundaries of the slide.
Plane failures are analysed two-dimensionally; the rock block that may fail is consid-
ered to be built up of a series of slices of unit thickness taken normal to the slope direc-
260 CHAPTER 9 · Withdrawal of Support by Surface Excavations
tion. The stability calculation is the same as that for the cuboid block, except that the weight
of the block is rather more difficult to calculate because of its irregular shape (Fig. 9.11).
If the slope angle, height and the dip of the basal discontinuity are known (Fig. 9.11)
then it is quite easy to calculate the weight of the potential slide. Hoek and Bray (1981)
have produced charts to allow calculation of the stability of slopes of various dimen-
sions and geometries. Figure 9.11 also shows the true profile of an existing slope as
surveyed, as opposed to the simplified profile which might be utilised to calculate slope
weight. Whether or not such a simplification is justified depends on the irregularity
of the true profile. Should there be a tension crack in the slope (Fig. 9.11) the calcula-
tion must include the possible condition of the crack being water filled and water pres-
sure acting on the crack, and the underside of the slope block. In this case, for a line of
section slice of unit width,
(9.10)
where
V=Force of water in tension crack= (9.11)
and
U=Force of water on sliding plane= (9.12)
where L is the length of the potential sliding discontinuity from tension crack to its
outcrop.
The simple equations developed above illustrate the significance of water-filled
tension cracks and the importance of draining these cracks when they occur along or
behind the slope crest. The development of a tension crack may be a consequence of
sliding movement along a basal plane but could also be the result of a general redis-
tribution of stress following the withdrawal of support to the rock mass from which
the slope has been formed. It is important to determine, if possible, the cause of ten-
sion crack development for if movement on a basal plane has occurred then its strength
may have been reduced from peak to residual values. Whether the appearance of ten-
sion cracks may be considered as implying that the slope is near failure or not, their
presence constitutes an extra hazard because they make it easier for surface run-off
water to enter into the slope.
Wedge Failure
A block of rock may be defined by two discontinuities, dipping towards each other,
whose line of intersection dips out of the rock slope (Fig. 9.9b). The most common
9.4 · Slopes in Rock 261
Fig. 9.11. Profile for analysis of plane failure
combination of discontinuities giving a wedge is that of a bedding plane and a joint.
Analytical techniques have been developed to assess the stability of such wedges (Hoek
and Bray 1981), assuming that the wedge is supported by friction only and that ϕ is
known for both discontinuities.
Toppling Failure
In rock masses where the discontinuity pattern gives tall rock columns it has been
observed that columns may fall when sliding movement on their steeply inclined sets
of discontinuities is sufficient to bring the centre of gravity of the block outside its
base. Such failure is described as toppling (Fig. 9.9c). The toppling block must rest on
an outwardly, and commonly shallowly, inclined plane. In some coarser igneous rocks,
particularly dolerites and gabbros in sills, tall columns may suffer weathering, con-
centrated around joints, and exfoliation. This leaves rock blocks separated by rotten
rock which may readily weather away and promote falls (Fig. 9.9c).
9.4.3
2D Theory versus 3D Reality
Most of the drawings in the preceding part of this chapter show sections of slope in
two dimensions to aid explanation of stability theory but slopes are, in reality, three
dimensional so that all stability problems must be considered three dimensionally.
Thus a true cross-section may be as in Fig. 9.11 but, if the slope is on a promontory,
the tension crack may outcrop and thus never fill with water. Rock slopes may have
general inclinations and directions that are favourable for stability with regard to the
overall discontinuity pattern but any gullies, clefts and promontories will locally change
slope orientation and allow failure to take place. These and similar problems can be
262 CHAPTER 9 · Withdrawal of Support by Surface Excavations
reduced by analyzing the stability of a slope using a number of 2D sections drawn in
different directions through the slope. These will help identify directions in which
failure is possible (i.e. kinematically possible) and of these, define those on which the
forces operating are sufficient to actually cause failure to occur.
9.5
Engineering Excavations
Before a slope can be made a hole must be dug. The choice of excavation technique
will depend upon the nature of the material to be excavated, the shape of the hole to
be made and whether the excavation is on land or underwater. Figure 9.12 gives a guide
to the choice of techniques for excavation.
In soils on land excavation may be undertaken by scrapers and bulldozers when
the area to be excavated is large or long, as in road construction. Smaller excavations
and closed excavations (such as for foundations) are mostly dug by mechanical shov-
els and buckets. Very small excavations (for drains, sewers etc.) are dug by bucket ex-
cavators. Specialised machinery has been developed for pipeline trenching.
Underwater excavation is done by dredging. Some types of dredger are illustrated
in Fig. 9.13. There are many different designs of dredger, most of which are adap-
tations of surface excavation techniques and equipment for use underwater. How-
ever, there are major differences in the methods used to remove excavated mate-
rial from site. Thus, for example, material cut out by the cutter head in Fig. 9.13a
is sucked up into the dredger and may be pumped through floating pipelines to
shore.
9.5.1
Surface Excavations in Rock
In rock the suitability of a particular excavation technique is determined by the prop-
erties of the rock mass which consists of materials cut by discontinuities. The proper-
ties of main importance are:
(cid:1) the strength of the rock material,
(cid:1) the size of the rock blocks (as determined by the three dimensional spacing of
discontinuities),
(cid:1) the openness of the discontinuities,
(cid:1) the orientation of the discontinuities.
The success or failure of many a rock excavation contract has depended on the de-
cision, made at the time of tendering, regarding any pre-treatment that the rock mass
should receive before excavating. Possible pre-treatments to loosen the rock mass
before excavation are:
(cid:1) ripping, in which a massive steel tooth is driven into, and dragged through, the rock
by a bulldozer (Fig. 9.14);
(cid:1) blasting to loosen or ‘lift’ the rock mass;
(cid:1) blasting to fracture and loosen the rock mass.

How much the rock has to be loosened before being dug out will depend on the
size and power of the digger used. Assessing which technique should be applied to
loosen the rock mass is of considerable importance in terms of the cost per unit vol-
ume for excavation. This rises considerably if blasting is necessary.
One of the first approaches to establishing the technique suitable for excavating
particular rock masses was made by Franklin et al. (1971), in which the two param-
eters of rock strength and discontinuity spacing were utilised. Figure 9.12b gives ap-
proximate limits to digging, ripping, blasting to loosen and blasting to fracture based
on the simple idea that the bigger the rock blocks and the stronger the rock, the greater
the effort to be applied to excavate. The rock mass characteristics of discontinuity
spacing and rock material strength are also reflected in measurements of the seismic
velocity of the rock mass, for velocity through the material generally increases with
increasing strength while it decreases with increasing discontinuity frequency. Very
approximate velocity boundaries have been established, for particular rock types, to
indicate the suitability of ripping or blasting as pretreatments before digging (Fig. 9.15).
Fig. 9.15. Approximate velocity
boundaries between rippable
and non-rippable rock masses.
The generalised strength and
spacing indicates the relation-
ship between rock strength,
block size and rippability
266 CHAPTER 9 · Withdrawal of Support by Surface Excavations
The velocity measurements would also be influenced by such rock mass character-
istics as discontinuity openness, the position of the water table and discontinuity
anisotropy. This suggests that velocity measurements combined with discontinuity
spacing and rock material strength may provide a satisfactory guide to any excava-
tion pretreatment required. However, it should be noted that the seismic velocity in a
layered rock mass may be an average velocity. If geophone spacings are large, high
velocity layers in a low velocity matrix may give an intermediate velocity which may
seem to indicate rippability although a few high velocity (i.e. strong and intact) bands
may make this impossible. Accordingly, whatever measurements are made to assist
estimates of rippability, there must be a thorough knowledge of the geology of the site.
Much will also depend on the power of the machine used and, for a given machine, on
whether the machine is in good mechanical condition and the driver is skilled in his
work.
If the rock mass has a strongly anisotropic structure, the rippability of the rock will
depend much upon the direction of the principal discontinuity in relation to the di-
rection of attack of the ripper; Fig. 9.14 illustrates the differences. If the dip follows
the length of the excavation the direction of ripping may be chosen to give the most
favourable result.
Another way to examine the excavatability of a rock mass is by use of a rock mass
classification. Table 9.1 gives that of Weaver (1975) as an example. Since appraisal by
rock mass classification can take account of more factors than other simpler methods
it is likely to develop into the main tool to determine excavatability. However, for most
major civil engineering work excavation trials are held using a variety of excavation
techniques; the limits for ripping can then be determined on site.
9.5.2
Excavation Underwater
Under water excavation is more difficult than on land where the operator of the exca-
vating machine can see what he is excavating and can adjust his attack to suit minor
variations in rock structure to get the maximum use of the available power.
This is not the case underwater where the operator has little flexibility in the use of
the cutting and digging mechanism and cannot see what he is doing.
Also, in dredging it is as much a problem to bring material to the surface as it is to
dislodge it from the sea or river floor. Thus core stone boulders from a corestone weath-
ered mass could be dislodged by the cutter of a suction-cutter dredger but not neces-
sarily brought to the surface by the suction pipe. To remove such dislodged material
another dredger, say a grab dredger, might have to be brought on site at great expense,
entailing extra costs and perhaps loss for the contractor. It follows then that investiga-
tions for dredging contracts, particularly rock dredging, should be of higher standard
than those on land and should incorporate not only good quality sampling, geophys-
ics and so forth but also adequate examination of on-shore and underwater outcrops.
A problem of particular importance is that of lightly cemented granular soils. In
dredging granular soils by suction-cutter the cutter undercuts slopes which fail and
then the slumped and disturbed material is sucked to surface. If the soil is lightly ce-
mented the slope will not fail, all material has to be cut before sucking, and much more
energy has to be expended for each unit of material excavated. Unfortunately materi-

als of this nature may break up during sampling by boring so that a routine inspec-
tion of the sample reveals nothing of the cemented nature of the material in situ. De-
tailed study of seismic records may help to identify the problem, for cementation may
raise velocities to values higher than would be expected for non-cemented material.
Carbonate deposits (reef debris, carbonate sands etc.) should always be regarded with
suspicion, particularly if they were once, in the geological history of the area, above
sea level allowing duricrust formation to take place. The fall of sea level during the
Pleistocene and its subsequent rise makes this a possibility in many areas.
9.6
Investigations of Slope Stability
Slope stability investigations fall into three broad categories. These are:
1. investigations of ground masses into which slopes will be cut in order to design that
slope;
2. investigations of existing slopes in order to determine their stability;
3. investigations of existing landslides.
9.6.1
Investigations for the Design of Excavated Slopes
The objective of these investigations is to build up a three dimensional geotechnical
model of the ground in which the slope is to be cut. The model must include such quan-
titative data as is necessary to put numerical values into slope stability formulae on
material and discontinuity properties, the distribution of materials, the position and
orientation of discontinuities, and the position of the groundwater table(s). Seasonal
variations in groundwater levels should be known together with such environmental
influences as may act upon the completed slope.
Investigations of slopes in soil are mostly undertaken by standard boring and sam-
pling techniques. If the slope will be such that soil will overlie rock in the slope then it
is essential that the topography of the bedrock surface be known, in detail, for there
may be a danger that soil will slide on the bedrock surface. Such detail cannot be found
by boreholes alone; additional data should be acquired using geophysical methods;
seismic or ground penetrating radar methods are usually appropriate.
If the slope is in rock then discontinuity orientations and strengths must be known,
in order to make a stability analysis. While such data may be derived from boreholes
it is best obtained by mapping existing outcrops or man-made excavations (tunnels,
shafts, pits, or large diameter boreholes).
Information on discontinuity orientations may be displayed by plotting on a
stereonet. Figure 9.16 outlines the basic principles of the construction and use of
stereonets. More detailed descriptions may be sought in Hoek and Bray (1981) and
Phillips (1968). The objective of this is to establish a limited number of dominant ori-
entations which may then be used in stability analysis and slope design.
Experience has shown that within a particular volume of rock mass, which may be
described as a domain, the discontinuities will fall into sets with more or less uniform
9.6 · Investigations of Slope Stability 269

divided into upper and lower hemispheres. A line drawn from the sphere centre at right angles to the
plane intercepts the sphere surface at a pole. c Lines of latitude and longitude on one half of the sphere
may be projected onto a plane surface to give a projection. A pole on the surface of the sphere (X) may
be shown on the projection (X'). d A projection showing the poles of the sphere is a ‘polar projection’,
as in (c) The dots represent plots of individual discontinuities which fall into three groups. e A projec-
tion from the side showing the equator an ‘equatorial projection’. Projections vary depending on the
position of the point of projection and may be designed to show true angles (as in (e)) or equal area.
Usually poles are plotted on a projection of a lower hemisphere
orientations (Fig. 9.17). How big a domain is will depend upon the complexity of the
geological structure. In general, the older the rock mass the more complex the geo-
logical structure and the smaller the domains. If, in a given rock mass, discontinuity
orientations are plotted on the stereonet irrespective of the mass structure, the
stereonet for a mass with many domains will display a cloud of data points. Accord-
ingly one of the first tasks in preparing orientation data is to select domains within
the mass. This is not easy if the data to be plotted comes entirely from boreholes.
If the data is plotted on a stereonet then the cloud of poles may be contoured to
show where the greatest density of poles lies. Methods of contouring pole density are
discussed in Hoek and Bray (1981). The orientation of the point of greatest density is
then considered to be the orientation of the discontinuity to be used for stability analy-
sis. In such a plot it is prudent to indicate which type of discontinuity is being plotted,
whether, for example, it is bedding, a joint or a shear zone.
It must be understood that the contoured stereogram is only a representation of
the information recorded. It is not a type of statistical analysis. Indeed, many engi-
neering geologists prefer to select dip directions for use in stability analysis by eye in
the field, rather than at the desk through contouring.

Fig. 9.17. The plan shows
strikelines on a bedding plane
surface in an anticline. It is pro-
posed to make a road cutting
through the anticline. Direc-
tions of dip and dips will con-
tinuously vary around the anti-
cline, but three domains are
chosen within which the bed-
ding orientation is considered
to be uniform. Stable slope an-
gles are calculated using these
values in each domain. Joint
sets in each domain could also
be considered uniform
One problem associated with contouring poles on a stereonet is that this displays
only orientations and in this respect treats all surfaces equally. Factors of equal impor-
tance in slope stability are discontinuity persistence and frequency. These factors, to-
gether with orientation, must be considered to select those discontinuities, in a do-
main, which will influence the design of a new cut slope; the poles to persistent sur-
faces can be highlighted to help them stand out from the background of poles to less
persistent surfaces. The choice of domain boundaries may also be influenced by the ϕ
value assigned to the discontinuity which dominates stability. If this is close to the dip
angle, then perhaps domains may be chosen relative to quite small variations in dip.
Clearly there are many factors to be considered in constructing the geotechnical model
in which slope design may be undertaken.
9.6.2
Investigations of Existing Slopes
Some slopes in soils, for example those cut for motorway construction, may exhibit
signs of distress and potential or limited movement and have thus to be examined to
determine their actual stability. In such a case the investigation should gather adequate
data for a satisfactory analysis by conventional methods.
Rock slopes may exhibit rock falls and their examination in the field is necessary
to determine the extent of the danger and, if necessary, to gather sufficient data to al-
low design of remedial works. Mapping may be done on various scales. On the large
scale the first task is to determine the general structural geology and to see how this
relates to existing slope stability. Edinburgh Castle rock is a basalt plug, once a feeder
pipe to a volcano, which dominates the centre of Edinburgh (Price and Knill 1967).
This has been subject to glacial and other erosion, and to some degree modified by
man. The plug exhibits three main joint sets. These are:
9.6 · Investigations of Slope Stability 271
1. dome joints, which dip downwards and outwards radially and quite shallowly from
the plug centre to its periphery;
2. radial joints, very steeply or vertically dipping, striking along radii from the centre;
and
3. circumferential joints, which dip very steeply and srike parallel to the plug periphery.
Joints from each set are present in every exposed rock face, but vary in frequency
and persistence. Where dome joints are dominant slopes tend to be relatively gently
inclined due to past rock slides on this joint set. Where circumferential joints are domi-
nant slopes are steeper and show signs of potential or actual failure by toppling. Where
radial joints are dominant, slopes are steep and relatively stable; the basic situation is
illustrated in Fig. 9.18. It should be noted that joint dominance may vary with height
as well as position in plan.
Such slope assessments may be done on a background topographical map prepared
with contours drawn relative to a vertical datum plane (Fig. 9.19). If the general to-
pography gives uninterrupted views of the rock slope and allows stereopairs of pho-
tographs to be taken horizontally, such a map may be prepared by terrestrial photo-
grammetry or its digital equivalent. Measurements taken from them establish discon-
tinuity orientations. Alternatively, if the intention is to stabilise the rock face by bolt-
ing, maps may be prepared using the front face of scaffolding as a datum plane and
taking horizontal distance measurements from this (see Fig. 4.9). Discontinuities may
be plotted on the resulting map which is thence interpreted to define rock blocks and
set target depths for rock bolting.
Photogrammetry or scaffolding allows the whole slope to be examined, but neither
may be possible, thus limiting the observer to the lower slope that can be reached. An
engineering geologist should be equipped not only with conventional compass/clinom-
eters which must be placed on a discontinuity surface to measure dip and strike, but
also with compasses and clinometers which allow dips and strikes to be measured by
sighting along them. With such instruments orientations can be measured at locations
which cannot be reached. Slope profiles may be constructed using compass, clinom-

eter and tapes (to measure baselines); portable range finders, sextants and binoculars
are also useful additions to simple field survey equipment.
Discontinuity data may be obtained by observations along a ‘scan-line’. This is noth-
ing more than a tape stretched along a rock face, usually at its base, and the orienta-
tion, character and tape length location of each discontinuity is recorded. Computer
programs exist which perform statistical analyses of scan-line data to aid assessment
of slope stability. Scan-line data may be conveniently recorded on a ‘discontinuity data
survey sheet’ or a form linked to the entry of data into the computer program.
If the purpose of the work is to assess the stability of a slope in detail then, follow-
ing the survey, the rock slope is divided into rock blocks which have failure potential
dependant on the dip of basal planes, discontinuity strength and so forth. This requires
an understanding of the three dimensional structural geology of the rock slope. Such
an understanding is absolutely essential if remedial works to improve the factor of
9.7 · Design of Slopes 273
safety of the slope are to be designed. Alternatively the data may be entered into a rock
mass classification designed to assess the general stability of a rock slope as described
in Sect. 4.9.
9.7
Design of Slopes
All excavated slopes are designed to a chosen factor of safety. This is generally not lower
than 1.5 and not greater than about 2.5, but in every slope design there may be ‘hid-
den’ safety factors obtained by choosing conservative values of strength, or pessimis-
tic views with regard to water pressure. It is important to decide whether the slope
should have “long-term” or “short-term” stability. Most road, railway, canal etc. slopes
are designed for long-term stability in which case account must be taken of the pos-
sible reduction in strength of materials and discontinuities as the result of weather-
ing and erosion of the slope by gullying from rain wash. Slopes with short-term sta-
bility could be some open mine slopes and the slopes for foundation excavations. In
excavations in soil over rock the critical factor may be the slope of the bedrock topog-
raphy on which the soil rests.
In slopes in rock where stability problems usually occur by sliding over disconti-
nuities the slope can be designed on the basis of the strength of these discontinuities.
This is done using the same basic formulae as in the example of the sliding block of
rock (Eq. 9.1). The only complication is that the shape of the block is no longer neatly
rectangular, but an irregular shape whose weight is difficult to calculate. However if
the geological situation is favourable it may be possible to design a rock slope so that
any unfavourably inclined discontinuities do not outcrop on the slope. Thus, in rock
slope design one of the simplest design techniques is to arrange for the slope direc-
tion and angle to be such that no steeply dipping discontinuity outcrops from the ex-
cavated slope (Fig. 9.20a).
This very simple approach is often the best for road cuttings and similar perma-
nent excavations when space and orientation of the works permits such freedom of
choice, for it avoids having to assign values of c and ϕ to discontinuities. Calculating
safe slope angle based on c and ϕ values is possible in fresh rock masses such as, per-
haps, open pit mines, but in civil engineering excavations, which are often within the
weathered zone, it is very difficult to assign a single value to c and ϕ that the designer
will be confident will apply to the whole slope. Also civil engineering excavations are
permanent and long-term weakening of discontinuities by weathering after excava-
tion has to be considered.
In almost any excavation there must be some discontinuities which outcrop on one
slope. Thus in the Fig. 9.20b discontinuity ‘a’ outcrops and could allow sliding on the
east slope if ‘a’ is a very weak discontinuity, particularly prominent and frequent, or
liable to long-term deterioration. If so the slope could be flattened to the inclination
of ‘a’. Alternatively, it is possible that local support works could be planned for areas
in which, after excavation, it seemed likely that local failures on ‘a’ could occur.
The discontinuity set on which sliding may take place need not be continuous
through the slope for movement to occur. In Fig. 9.20c short discontinuous ‘a’ joints
serve for sliding surfaces for small instabilities but could also link along ‘x-y’ to give a
whole-slope failure.
274 CHAPTER 9 · Withdrawal of Support by Surface Excavations
Fig. 9.20. Aspects of slope de-
sign in rock
If the inclination of the slope produced by this method is not acceptable then the
slope may be designed using values of c and ϕ for the discontinuities which seem ap-
propriate. This may require flattening the slope to give the required long-term factor
of safety. However, if for reasons of land purchase or adverse environmental impact
the plan area of the excavation should be kept as small as possible, then the slope might
have to be supported by rock anchorages which, in Fig. 9.20d are placed to resist col-
lapse along discontinuities ‘c’ and ‘a’.
9.7.1
Benching on Slopes
Many excavations are dug out in layers, because of their height or for convenience of
excavation, so that the resulting slopes have a stepped appearance. In open mines these
9.7 · Design of Slopes 275
Fig. 9.21. Benched rock slopes.
The overall stability of slope AB
is adequate but falls from po-
tentially unstable slopes of
component benches could
block bench access and bounce
on accumulated debris to reach
road. Slope AC has stable com-
ponent slopes and is totally
stable but occupies more space
and entails more excavation
steps or benches may be used as temporary or permanent haulage roads. In slope de-
sign it is important to decide whether the benches should lie inside or outside the safe
slope. Figure 9.21 shows two possible slope designs in a rock mass containing domi-
nant discontinuities dipping at β degrees. In design AB the overall slope is stable but
the benches are potentially unstable. In AC both slope and component benches are
stable but both excavation volume and land acquisition are greater.
It is sometimes considered that benches serve to trap rock falls from plunging down
the whole slope. However, in slope AB the rock falls onto a bench may help promote
its collapse and rock falls that fall on the bench may accumulate until they form a
launching ramp for falls that come from above. If benches are used as rock traps they
must be regularly cleared of fallen debris.
9.7.2
Drainage
Figure 9.2 demonstrates the adverse effect of water pressures in a slope. It is thus good
practice to insert drainage holes into rock slopes to allow any water in the slope to
drain away as rapidly as possible. In most rock slopes water movement will be along
discontinuities. Accordingly the direction of the drain holes should be such as to in-
tersect the maximum number of, or at least the dominant, discontinuities. To do this
requires an understanding of the discontinuity pattern in the slope in three dimen-
sions. Well maintained and sealed drainage channels at the top of rock slopes can in-
tercept and drain away any surface runoff that would otherwise enter the slope.
9.7.3
The Effect of Excavation Technique on Slope Stability
The stability of a slope depends to a great extent upon discontinuities (Fig. 9.22). Even
in a carefully excavated slope stress relief may induce joint opening which allows in-
gress of water and plant roots to induce long-term decay (Fig. 9.22b). Rock excava-
tion often requires blasting to break the rock before it can be excavated. If this blast-
276 CHAPTER 9 · Withdrawal of Support by Surface Excavations
Fig. 9.22. The influence of excavation techniques on rock slope stability. After excavation of a slope in
rock mass (a) stress relief may bring about joint opening (b) which could be a source of long-term de-
terioration. Excessive blasting (c) can open existing discontinuities and create new ones so that any slope
design based on the original rock mass properties is no longer valid. This may be overcome by blasting
with a buffer zone (d) or, seen in perspective, pre-splitting (e)
ing fractures the rock from which the final slope is to be made, than these fractures
will reduce stability (Fig. 9.22c). Most engineering geologists have seen slopes in which
the rock mass structure was basically favourable for stability but, once excavated, be-
came unstable due to excessive and poorly executed blasting. For permanent slopes
care should be taken that the blasting for excavation does not disrupt the slope. While
much disruption may be avoided by employing experienced and able blasting con-
tractors working to a clearly written and closely defined contract, various working
techniques may be employed to reduce rock mass disturbance.
The fracturing that may be induced in the final slope as the result of excavation
blasting is minimized by establishing a ‘buffer zone’. No blasting takes place within
this zone which is partly fractured by blasting from the area above. The fractured rock
in the buffer zone is pulled down using excavating machinery to form the final slope.
The buffer zone may be 2–3 m wide (Fig. 9.22d). Damage to the designed slope from
the bulk blast may also be prevented or reduced by the technique known as ‘pre-split-
ting’. In this a row of boreholes is drilled along the plane of the design slope. The holes
are parallel, about 1 m or so apart. They are charged with suitable explosive which is
then detonated. This causes a crack to run between the holes so that the plane of re-
quired slope is marked by a continuous crack (Fig. 9.22e). The rock in the excavation
is then removed by normal drilling and blasting techniques; fracturing caused by the
normal blasting is found not to pass through the boundary fracture plane.
9.8 · Existing Landslides 277
The method produces very fine, clean rock faces. However, it must be noted that
the inclination of the pre-split fracture must be that of the stable slope whose stability
is determined by the discontinuities within it. Pre-splitting does not make a slope stable
but prevents it becoming unstable as the result of fracturing following blasting. The
method works best in uniform rock conditions. It may not work at all if the rock mass
is particularly anisotropic as the result of geology or weathering, for in such a case
the boreholes may not be parallel and success in crack-forming would vary because
of the varying response to shock of the different rock materials.
In a rock face that has been well pre-split the observer should see parallel lines of
half boreholes on the face. The efficacy of the pre-split may be assessed by comparing
the length of boreholes drilled to the length of borehole seen in half section. Thus a
‘Pre-splitting Index’ can be easily defined as:
(9.13)
The nearer the index approaches 100%, the better the pre-split. If, however, the
design slope follows a discontinuity plane then a good ‘split’ may be obtained without
a high index for the blast would tend to open the pre-existing discontinuity rather than
create another one. On some contracts very good slopes may be formed only to be
damaged by later minor works. Thus blasting out a drainage trench at the foot of a
face could, if carelessly done, damage the toe of the slope above.
While techniques may be applied to reduce bulk excavation disturbance in the rock
mass forming the final slope, some disturbance is inevitable. Some problems may be
caused by error. Thus, for example, infrequent shear planes, near impossible to detect
in investigations, may give local stability problems. Completed slopes must be exam-
ined to discover such features that may give rise to short- or long-term stability prob-
lems and remedial measures applied. It is important, particularly in road excavations,
that, for reasons of safety and economy, that remedial works be implemented before
the road is opened.
However, experience suggests that the greatest source of excavated rock slope in-
stability is poor workmanship in the use of explosives. It is noticeable that many very
old slopes excavated by hand and by blasting by gunpowder in short boreholes are
stable, while their modern counterparts in similar geological conditions but excavated
using much more powerful explosives and deeper boreholes are unstable. There is little
point in spending time in investigation and elegant rock slope design if the excava-
tion technique employed destroys any possibility of achieving a stable slope.

Existing Landslides
9.8.1
Recognition and Identification
Existing landslides, some originating many thousands of years ago, may pose major
engineering problems. Those which are presently dormant may be reactivated inad-
278 CHAPTER 9 · Withdrawal of Support by Surface Excavations
vertently by engineering works while those which are presently active, continuously
or intermittently, pose a constant problem.
There are many different types of mass movement (a term covering all types of slope
disturbance) ranging from simple rock falls from a cliff to rock slides or topples
(Fig. 9.9), debris avalanches, rotational failure (Fig. 9.23) to very large complex move-
ments such as may be found in most recent mountain chains. The larger landslides
usually involve rock and produce a hummocky landscape with ponds or swampy ar-
eas. An example profile is given in Fig. 9.24. Most slides are betrayed by ground fis-
sures and, if supporting vegetation, by trees showing bent trunks.
Perhaps the first most important step in dealing with landslides is to recognise that
one exists, for it is generally not a good idea to attempt to undertake engineering works
on, in or through landslides. Landslides are best avoided.
Many authors have attempted to classify mass movements, perhaps the most widely
cited being that of Varnes (1958). However, while all landslides are dangerous, those
which move more rapidly than people can escape may be considered the greatest haz-
ard. The classification of Hutchinson (1988) includes comments on the rapidity of
movement of mass movements. Those generally recognised as the most dangerous
involve the movement of saturated debris and include such phenomena as mudflows,
peat bog bursts, lahars (from volcanoes) and also dry debris flows from scree slopes.

Rates of Movement
The Fall of Threatening Rock
On 22 January 1941, Threatening Rock, or Braced up Cliff as it was known to the Na-
vajo Indians, finally fell. This 30000 ton monolith of Cliff House Sandstone, which rose
behind the ruins of Pueblo Bonito in Chaco Canyon National Monument, New Mexico
(Fig. 9.25), was of concern to the National Park Service Personnel, as it had been to
the inhabitants of Pueblo Bonito in the 11th century, who had attempted to wedge the
rock in position with tree trunks.
Because of the concern that fall of the rock would severely damage Pueblo Bonito,
National Park Service personnel began, in 1935, to measure the distance between the
rock and the cliff from which it had been detached. The measurements were recorded
until the fall of the rock in 1941. In the figure cumulative rock movement and (Fig. 9.22)
cumulative precipitation are plotted as a function of time (Schumm and Chorley 1964).
Although precipitation was well above average during the latter part of 1940, the pre-
cipitation does not show the progressively greater increments with time that is shown
by the curve of rock movement. The rock appears to have been stationary for con-
secutive periods of several months, but then moved progressively farther as time
passed. The irregularities of the curve in Fig. 9.26 suggest an intermittent application
of increments of stress either causing or as a result of periodic failures.
The most rapid rates of movement occurred between the dates of hard frosts or
during the winter, whereas the periods of slight movement occurred during the sum-
mer months. Seasonal frost action, although effective in promoting surface creep in
soils of that region, could not be expected to be as effective in moving a 30000 ton
block of sandstone. Possibly the higher precipitation of summer, on average 15 cm for

each period of least movement, in contrast to 8 cm for each winter period of greater
movement, was less effective in causing a build up of water pressure beneath and be-
hind the mass than the freezing of fractures over winter; these would prevent the drain-
age of winter snow that had thawed in the rock mass and normal discharge of ground-
water from the mass.
Whatever the cause of failure it is important to note the acceleration of movement
opening the backing crack up to the point of collapse. Should a steep rock face, whether
natural or excavated, be found to have a backing crack it is desirable to instrument the
crack to measure regularly any vertical or horizontal movement of the face in front of
the crack. The instrumentation need not be complex but should the measurements
reveal increasing rates of movement then the time is ripe to consider the safety of
people and property below the slope.
9.8 · Existing Landslides 281
Portuguese Bend
The active Portuguese Bend Landslide occupies about 1.5 km2 on the south side of
Palos Verdes Hills, south of Los Angeles, California. The head of the slide lies about
130 m above sea level, and the toe generally lies just seaward of the shore line in the
shallow surf zone. Moderately indurated tuffaceous and sandy shales and silt stones
of Miocene age dipping towards the coast within a seaward plunging shallow asym-
metric syncline are interbedded with several bentonite beds, at least one of which is
believed to act as an incompetent zone along which the landslide is creeping. Some
more recent sediments have been discovered which are believed to have been depos-
ited within lakes held in depressions formed by earlier landsliding.
Although the presently active landslide is a portion of an ancient landslide which
is known to have been active several thousand years ago (Merriam 1960), it was inac-
tive when a number of roads and homes were constructed on it, mostly in the early
1950s, in the area west of Crenshaw Boulevard and north and south of Palos Verdes
Drive South (Fig. 9.27). The recent phase of movement is believed to have begun in
Fig. 9.27. Portuguese Bend. The movement vectors and cracks shown relate to the situation in July 1957
when the landslide was active. Only the major ground cracks are shown; there were many more smaller
ones. The numbered and shaded areas show the spread of the landslide between September 1956 and

282 CHAPTER 9 · Withdrawal of Support by Surface Excavations
September 1956, and has continued at varying rates. From 1956 to 1973 parts of Palos
Verdes Drive South were displaced seaward a maximum of approximately 40 m (Easton
1973). Between 1956 and 1958 the landslide spread so that in Fig. 9.27 area 1 repre-
sents its extent in September 1956, 2 its additional extent in January 1957, and 3 and 4
extensions in May 1957 and October 1958 respectively. Survey points were established
in 1956 to monitor movement; some of the movement vectors recorded between Sep-
tember 1956 and December 1957 are shown in Fig. 9.27.
Boreholes sunk to investigate the landslide suggested that the lowest shear surfaces
on which movement was taking place could be as deep as 90 m below surface. Attempts
were made to stabilise the landslide by inserting precast concrete caissons, about 1¼ m
diameter and 6 m long into holes drilled into rock below the presumed sliding sur-
face. These were grouted into place, at locations near the coast, leaving about 3 m pro-
jecting upwards into the moving mass and were supposed to act as shear pins to re-
strain the moving mass. The movement was not stopped, although each of the cais-
sons provided an estimated resistance of about 450000 kgf and about 25 were installed.
Some tilted, some may have sheared, but it is thought that the disrupted landslide mass
may have flowed around them.
In a later study by Easton (1973), which examined the influence of such factors as
rainfall, earthquakes, tides and barometric pressures on rates of movement, increments
of movement were measured for about two years (1970 and 1971) at first weekly, and
then later on, daily. These measurements spanned one major and one minor rainy sea-
son and two noteworthy earthquakes. Rates of movement ranged from about 5 to
20 mm per day. Easton found that movement rate was increased by earthquakes of
significant local intensity, the amount of increase depending upon the condition of
the slide (for example, whether or not saturated) at the time of the earthquake. The
landslide also responded rapidly to rainfall, presumably due to increased weight
of the moving mass and a reduction in effective stresses within it. Movement also
accelerated during periods of high tides, particularly those with longer periods of high
water. This may be attributed in part to the saturation of the basal plane of the slide
close to the ocean and the reduction of the resistance to movement of the submerged
front of the landslide due to the buoyancy effect of the sea water and softening of the
clay.
One question that remains to be answered is why the landslide moved in 1956 after
what may have been many years of quiescence. Some embankment fill was placed at
the top of the slide at Crenshaw Boulevard, which may have increased driving forces
but the sensitivity of the landslide to moisture suggests that water ingress associated
with the housing construction prior to 1956 (by leaking water pipes, sewers or lawn
sprinklers) may have revived movement. The causes of the very first movement are
lost in the mists of time but coastal erosion, perhaps associated with the rise of sea
level at the end of the Pleistocene, coupled with earthquakes, would seem likely can-
didates.
9.8.3
Extent of Landslides
The occurrence of a rotational landslide on a long uniform engineered slope raises
not only the question of why it happened but also “why in that particular spot?” The
9.9 · Remedial Works for Slope Instability 283
answer to the second question lies in a variation in geological and hydrogeological
conditions giving a weaker ground mass within a particular volume of slope. When
the landslide has moved back scars and side scars usually present slopes which are
steeper than the slope that has failed. If the changes in geological and hydrogeological
conditions which occur at the scar locations are abrupt then the slide may stop at the
scar. If not, then the steepness of the scar slopes may ensure continuing failures so that
the landslide gradually spreads. Such spreading extension of landslides is relatively
common in the larger more complex slides. In any case weathering will act on scar
slopes and the slid mass and bring about further instability. Steward and Cripps (1983)
have described the chemical weathering of the pyritic shale of the Edale Shale and
indicated the part that this plays in phases of reactivation of the Mam Tor landslide in
Derbyshire, England.
9.9
Remedial Works for Slope Instability
Stabilisation works may be undertaken on existing landslides or other forms of clearly
unstable slope, such as a rock cliff giving rise to rock falls, or on slopes shown by cal-
culation to have a factor of safety lower than that deemed satisfactory.
Existing landslides may be either active or dormant. In both cases the most impor-
tant part of the investigation is to recognise that the landslide exists. Such landforms
may be recognised by ground surveys but are generally much more easily seen on aerial
photographs. Such photographs will not only show the form of the landslide but may
detect changes in vegetation which are a consequence of old landslides. False colour
photographs may indicate changes in moisture content which indicate the presence
of the slipped mass. On the ground bends in tree trunks may show that movement
occurred within the lifetime of the tree. Recognition of old landslide terrain is not easy,
particularly on the ground and often requires that combination of intuition and knowl-
edge which comes only after long years of experience.
Once the landslide has been recognised it is then necessary to determine its extent
in depth as well as in area and, if possible, to understand why the landslide occurred
in the first place. This is particularly important with old landslides because they may
have originated as a consequence of circumstances which no longer exist. In the north-
ern hemisphere many old landslides are believed to have occurred at the end of the
Pleistocene period following the retreat of the ice, when many slopes were rapidly de-
stressed and the climate was very different to that of today. Earthquakes, a consequence
of isostatic re-adjustment after the Pleistocene, may have triggered some of the slides.
To understand the present stability of the slide the various shear surfaces in the slide
must be discovered. These may be much deeper than expected and since many land-
slides are complex, containing slides within slides, the first shear surface encountered
in a borehole is not necessarily the one controlling the present stability. Accurate map-
ping of the extent of the slide and the types of mass movement within it may lead to
some assessment of the location of surfaces of movement.
Groundwater conditions must always be established. Since groundwater table levels
may be seasonal long-term observations are necessary and thus piezometers must be
installed. Rainfall records should include intensities and some idea of rate of infiltra-
tion and run-off should also be gathered. If the slide is moving then the rate of move-
284 CHAPTER 9 · Withdrawal of Support by Surface Excavations
ment should be monitored. Inclinometers set into boreholes may indicate the shear
surface on which the mass is moving.
The remedies for slope instability are well known and proven. However, there may
well be as many examples of unsuccessful application of the remedies as of successful
application. This is generally the consequence of a lack of understanding of the cause
of the particular problem. Thus while the choice of remedy might be correct, its appli-
cation to the wrong depth or in the wrong place or at the wrong time will not lead to a
satisfactory conclusion. There must be adequate investigation to recognise the cause
of the problem before the solution can be applied. This may take some time. If imme-
diate action is required no engineer can go far wrong if he initiates the construction
of slope drainage works.
9.9.1
Methods of Stabilisation
The methods of stabilisation that are most commonly applied fall within three groups.
These are: (1) changing the geometry of the slope, (2) drainage, and (3) giving sup-
port by reinforcement or force; less commonly, protecting the slope against deterio-
ration and changing the character of the material in the slope. Some of these tech-
niques are illustrated in Fig. 9.28.
Fig. 9.28. Methods of improv-
ing stability of slopes
9.9 · Remedial Works for Slope Instability 285
Changing the Geometry of the Slip
The stability of a slope depends upon the inclination of the slope in relation to the
strength of materials, the strength and orientation of discontinuities and the ground-
water conditions within the groundmass. The driving force for landsliding is the weight
of the mass above any potential failure surface and it is thus clear that a reduction in
the angle of the slope (Fig. 9.28a) or the removal of material from the top of the slope
(Fig. 9.28b), will improve the factor of safety of the slope.
Although removal of material seems an easy way to improve stability it may pose
considerable practical problems. In the case of slope flattening this should not be ap-
plied as a routine measure to improve stability without first determining the location
of the failure surface on which movement may be taking place. In the case shown in
Fig. 9.29 the slope is flatter and the total weight of material potentially in movement
is less. However, the soil removed has reduced the forces resisting movement more than
it has reduced the forces promoting it. It is better to remove from the top of the slope,
although this should be done with caution for the weight of excavating machinery could
cause failure. Hutchinson (1988) proposed a “neutral line” theory to help define the
position of OO' and hence the zone from which weight should not be removed. Small
landslides that could enable larger movements to develop upslope are often removed
rather than stabilised and replaced by dense granular permeable rock fill.
Drainage
Slopes may be drained by the introduction of shallowly inclined drainage holes
(Fig. 9.28d). The drainage holes are usually drilled into slopes by rotary drilling meth-
ods. The hole is lined with a slotted tube and often this tube is itself surrounded by a
solid ceramic filter material if the borehole is in soil. Occasionally drainage may be
undertaken by pumped wells but these are seldom used as a permanent means of slope
stabilisation because of the operating costs. However, they may be used as a tempo-
rary remedy, modifying the pumping rate to find the correct reduction of the water
table level to stop slope movement. In rock, driving a drainage tunnel (Fig. 9.28e) to

the case shown slices of ground

tional sliding while those to the

286 CHAPTER 9 · Withdrawal of Support by Surface Excavations
achieve this required reduction on a permanent basis (Sherrell 1971) is possible. This
is a particularly useful technique in large open mines where drills are readily avail-
able to drill wells and tunnels are easily constructed.
Support
In the case of potential or actual landslides support may be provided by placing weight
at the foot of the slope to resist downhill movement (Fig. 9.28c). Such work was done
to allow building a motorway on a landslide at Walton’s Wood. The paper by Early and
Skempton (1972) describes the work done in 1963, which may be considered a land-
mark in the development of geotechnical engineering.
At a location, known as Walton’s Wood, Staffordshire the attempt to build an em-
bankment for the M6 motorway, on what was later realized to be an old landslide, led
to severe slipping. The landslide mass consisted of clay mixed with fragments of rock
of all sizes derived by weathering, shearing, and perhaps solifluction, from mudstones,
sandstones and thin coal seams of the upper Coal Measures (Fig. 9.30). Instability of
the hillside had probably been initiated in Late Glacial times by the erosion of an ice-
marginal drainage channel, and there is evidence that the slope had not yet reached a
state of complete equilibrium when the engineering works began. The investigations
of this failure took place in two stages. In the first stage, the principal object was the
design of remedial measures. This involved: defining the limits and nature of the land-
slide by surveying, boring and trial pits, measuring the strength of the clay on these
surfaces, and measuring the pore water pressures in the landslide mass
The landslide has a width of about 300 m and extends about 200 m up the hillside
from its toe to the highest back-scarp. Numerous arcuate scarps existed (Fig. 9.30a),
some being comparatively fresh and others subdued and weathered. The landslide
mass, or ‘colluvium’, attains a maximum thickness of 10 m. It consists of clay, with
numerous fragments of mudstone, sandstone and coal. The average inclination of the
slope is 11°. In many cores from the borings, and in the trial pits, slip surfaces could
clearly be seen. They were polished and striated, and the clay for several millimetres
above or below typically had a light grey colour, in contrast to the adjacent yellow-
brown clay. This colour change is probably the result of a secondary chemical devel-
opment due to reducing water percolating along the slip surface. The piezometric ob-
servations demonstrate the existence of a perched water table (Fig. 9.30b) in the col-
luvium, at a higher level than the water table in the rock. This is due to the higher per-
meability of the landslide allowing rainfall to seep down within it above the almost
impermeable underlying mudstone. It is the perched water table which controls sta-
bility of the hillside. From a study of the observed shears in the trial pits and in cores
from the continuously sampled boreholes it was possible to reconstruct the most likely
pattern of slip surfaces within the landslide mass. The stability analysis of these sur-
faces showed that values of ϕ' between 13.5° and 15° were required for limiting equi-
librium.
This value of ϕ' was extraordinary low; according to the ideas current at that time,
a value of ϕ' equal to about 20° would have been expected. The second stage of the in-
vestigation had as its objectives a scientific study of the reasons for this discrepancy in

288 CHAPTER 9 · Withdrawal of Support by Surface Excavations
calculated and measured strengths. A clue already was available in the observation that
the clay particles on the slip surface were highly orientated in the direction of move-
ment, in contrast to an almost random orientation elsewhere in the clay. Samples of
previously unsheared clay were subjected to multiple reversal shear box tests. It was
found that after several reversals the strength fell to a constant value corresponding
closely to the strength on the natural slip surfaces, and that a slickensided shear plane
was produced quite similar to those seen in the landslide. The strength measured in
this way, and as found on the slip surfaces, was defined as the residual strength. More-
over, it agreed rather well with the strength as calculated from stability analysis of the
landslide.
The remedial measures consisted principally of a large buttress or ‘berm’ of earth
fill at the toe of the slope and trench drains 3 to 4.5 m deep at 20 m centres beneath
the rebuilt embankment (Fig. 9.30c). The soft clays and peat in the swamp were re-
moved and replaced by granular fill. An alternative to mass loading would have been
to construct a retaining wall, perhaps anchored, at the foot of the slide. However, this
is not so commonly done for a landslide that has already begun to move, because the
construction of the wall involves some excavation which may make matters worse.
Support can also be given by reinforcement and by the application of a retaining
force, when a retaining wall is not an option. Attempts have occasionally been made
to drive piles through landslide material into the stable material below the shear zone
at the bottom of the slide to add reinforcement and a measure of retaining force. These
have seldom been successful, usually because it has proved to be very difficult to cal-
culate the forces the piles have to resist and the sliding material has continued to move
around and between them. The resistance of retaining walls that are failing may be
increased by anchoring them to firm ground.
Cables and Bolts
Such anchorages may be rock bolts or steel cables and most commonly serve to stabi-
lize potential rock slides or rock falls. These operate by clamping the unstable rock
block back to the stable sound rock behind (Fig. 9.31). The force exerted by tension
on the anchor can be oriented to oppose the forces that tend to push the rock block
down the slope. Figure 9.31b shows a steel cable anchorage used to improve the sta-
bility of a rock block resting on a sloping discontinuity. Without the anchorage and
assuming c=0 (Fig. 9.1) the factor of safety (F) of the block is given by:
s
(9.14)
If the cable anchorage is tensioned so that the block is pressed against the backing
discontinuity with force F the factor of safety becomes:
(9.15)

Fig. 9.31. Rock bolts (a and c) and cable anchorages (b) used to stabilise rock slopes
290 CHAPTER 9 · Withdrawal of Support by Surface Excavations
The angle at which the ground anchor is inclined to the possible sliding plane is
critical; anchors must be inclined against the dip of the plane of sliding so that they
give no down dip component of force.
Ground anchorages may be grout anchored steel cables or steel bars or mechani-
cally or resin anchored rock bolts. Both are widely used for many engineering pur-
poses but generally cable anchorages are used for deep long anchorages and bolts for
shallow work.
For both types of anchorage successful installation and operation requires that, the
rock is strong enough to withstand the stresses imposed under the surface bearing
plate, the rock will not creep under these stresses and thus reduce anchorage load, the
rock near surface will not weather away around the bearing plate, and the steel of cable
or bolt shaft will not creep or corrode and thereby reduce the tension in the anchor-
age and thus the force applied. Figure 9.31a shows examples of potential slope insta-
bility and indicates how tensioned ground anchorages might be used to make some
slopes safe. Both the long cable anchorages (10 to 40 m+) and rock bolts (3 to 6 m)
must be protected against corrosion, especially if they are used as part of a perma-
nent engineering structure.
Anchorages should not be randomly distributed on a slope but used to support key
rock blocks. Thus, in Fig. 9.10, anchorages installed to support the blocks which are
free to move (F) will automatically support the intervening blocks. It is quite easy to
identify major rock blocks and to calculate the force necessary to support them to a
given factor of safety. However, the major blocks will also be divided by discontinuities
which might cause the block to spring apart if subjected to the force from a single
massive anchorage. Accordingly the total load required to stabilise a large block may
have to be applied by many smaller anchorages located so as to ensure no disruption
of the total block (Fig. 9.31c).
It may be that problems of corrosion, creep or weathering are such that the appli-
cation of tensioned anchorages seems undesirable. In such a case an alternative treat-
ment would be to install untensioned rock pins which would resist potential rock
movements in shear. They may be considered to increase the cohesion across any po-
tential sliding plane. Thus the equation for the factor of safety in the dry condition
(F) becomes:
s
(9.16)
where s=the safe shear strength of a steel rock pin and n=number of pins.
9.9.2
Remedial Works for Rock Falls
Natural or constructed rock slopes which are, on the scale of the total slope, inher-
ently stable may, through a process of natural decay or as a consequence of poor con-
struction, give rise to rock falls. While any rock slope anywhere may pose such prob-
lems most of them that have required attention are, in the author’s experience, road
and railway cuttings, coastal cliffs overlooking or supporting structures e.g. light-
9.9 · Remedial Works for Slope Instability 291
houses, hotels and cliffs underlying historical monuments, castles, cathedrals, earth
mounds and the like. While the rock falls may not be particularly large, perhaps no
more than a few tonnes weight, they pose a hazard to traffic and structures below them
and to the stability of structures built near the edge of the cliffs. The remedial works
that may be undertaken are briefly described in Table 9.2.
Stabilisation Works
The purpose of these is to prevent rock falls occurring by preserving and supporting
the rock face. Preservation always involves cleaning down loose debris, plants, trees
etc. the sealing of joints and cracks by grouting and surface coatings and the installa-
tion of drainage works, usually sub-horizontal boreholes inclined to the rock face thus
acting as drains. It is essential, if surface coatings are applied, such as cement based
shotcrete or gunite, that drainholes are installed to drain off any groundwater that might
build up behind the surface coating.
The support works for unstable rock slopes involve the installation of tensioned
rock bolts and untensioned reinforcing pins, underpinning of overhangs and the in-
stallation of buttresses. Both underpins and buttresses are usually anchored into place.
The first task is to choose the location and type of works to be undertaken. Usually it
follows the procedure given below:
1. A sketch topographic map of the slope is prepared using simple survey methods
(Fig. 9.32). This may serve to delineate the limits of the slope on which work has to
be done. A map of the slope area chosen is then prepared (using methods suggested
in Chap. 3) showing contours to a vertical datum plane.
2. Geological features (major joints, faults etc.) are plotted on the map. Orientations of
discontinuities are measured.
3. Potentially unstable blocks are recognised by the geology they present. Weights of
blocks are calculated, using the surface outcrops and orientations of the joints bound-
ing them, to determine their shape in three dimensions.
4. The amount of force or reinforcement required to raise the factor of safety of the
slope to a given value is calculated.
5. The total force or reinforcement required is divided by that which can be applied by
the chosen design of bolt or pin.
6. The number of bolts and pins needed for stabilisation is distributed within the block
area with regard to the internal jointing in the block, working space limitations
etc.(Fig. 9.31c).
In the design of the works careful consideration must be given to safety. Bolt, pin,
drain and grout holes are usually drilled by rotary percussive methods using com-
pressed air as a flushing medium. If any rock block is truly and dangerously unstable
then drilling a borehole through it could, for the driller, become nothing more than
an elaborate method of self destruction. If any large block should become dislodged
on to the scaffolding it could well cause the scaffolding to collapse, endangering those
working on it or below it. Accordingly the works should be planned to either allow
dangerous blocks to be supported by cables and nets anchored to more stable areas
or to fall through prepared gaps in the scaffolding. The scaffolding should also be

anchored to safe parts of the rock face and, if the works are being undertaken above
trafficked areas, fences or barriers should be erected to prevent any small rock falls
reaching them.
Grouting should be undertaken in small stages, each stage, once grouted, thence
being supported by bolts or pins before proceeding with a higher stage. In Fig. 9.33,
which shows part of a rock slope, grouting is undertaken in stages from the scaffold-

ing platforms so that stage 4 grouting is limited to that stage (Fig. 9.33b) and is un-
dertaken after stage 4 bolting has secured the face below. Thence stage 5 bolting pre-
cedes stage 5 grouting. Grouting, usually cement grout, should not be undertaken with
high pressures and any open surface cracks should be sealed before it begins. The grout-
ing is intended to prevent the uncontrolled passage of rainfall or groundwater through
the face and fill voids that could enable blocks to move and possibly fall or slide. How-
ever drainage holes must be provided, otherwise water flowing around the grouted
area could bring damage to adjacent faces.
Protection Works
Stabilisation work is expensive and it may be preferable and cheaper to protect sensi-
tive areas against damage from rock falls by the installation of ditches and fences
(Fig. 9.33d). The fence is to catch any rocks that may bounce from either the bottom
of the ditch, or other rocks already in it. Filling the ditch with an absorbent bed of
sand helps reduce bounce. Nets may be draped over the face. In Fig. 9.33e the nets are
held away from the face by spacer bolts so that falls are guided to be bottom of the
face. Nets in close contact with the rock or fastened to the face are not desirable for
while they will, for a time, stop debris reaching sensitive areas the debris will build up
so that, as the net deteriorates, eventually the net and debris may come down in one
major event.
Forward protection works seek to deflect or catch rocks falling from rock faces high
above target zones from rolling or bouncing down the underlying slope (Fig. 9.29f).
Fences or walls may prevent this movement if correctly sited. Correct siting depends
upon an appreciation of the shape and frictional properties of the slope below the rock
face (Hongey Chen et al. 1994). Such fences or walls may be severely damaged when
struck and it may be better to utilise flexible net catch-traps (Fig. 9.33f) in which the
weight of net slows down boulder velocity without imposing too much strain on the
structure. Whatever the character of the protection work, they require maintenance.
Apart from replacing any damaged or deteriorated nets, fences, posts etc. any rock col-
lected in ditches, traps or nets must be cleaned out and removed. Some thought should
be given to how this may be done at the time of construction of the works.

Withdrawal of Support by Underground Excavations
10.1
Introduction
Withdrawal of support by underground excavation is done each time an animal makes
an underground hole for its food and shelter. Mankind encountered caves and could
see that this removal of material was possible on a large scale, and eventually became
able to extract minerals for tools and materials for construction, and to create voids
for storage and space. The latter has become increasingly important due to the grow-
ing pressure on the use of surface space. Extraction of material from the subsurface
implies that the existing equilibrium between stress and strain in situ, and its con-
figuration in the ground, will be disturbed and redistributed due to the deformation
of the ground into the space left by the extracted material. Support may be required
to maintain the void created. Extraction of material may cause surface subsidence with
implications for surface structures. In many textbooks, a distinction is made between
underground structures in soil and rock masses. The author considers this differen-
tiation artificial because the boundary between what is considered a soil or a rock mass
is often not sharp; excavation and support methods originally developed for rock are
later often found also to be suitable for soil masses and vice versa, and seldom does a
project deal with rock or soil masses only. Hence, the engineering geologist should be
able to deal with underground excavations both in soil and in rock masses, even if only
for judging different location alternatives. This chapter describes the extraction of solid
materials, by methods common to civil engineering (mainly tunnelling) and mining,
and the influence geology can have upon the ground response associated with this
withdrawal of support.
10.2
Stress
The stress configuration in the sub-surface is one of the most important parameters
governing the withdrawal of material from the underground, the behaviour of an
underground opening, and the resulting subsidence at ground level.
10.2.1
In Situ Stress Field
The in situ, or virgin stresses, are the stresses in the subsurface before any extraction
of material. Stresses in the subsurface are caused by the weight of the overlying mate-
rial (the overburden). The vertical stress (S ) at depth H is:
v
296 CHAPTER 10 · Withdrawal of Support by Underground Excavations
(10.1)
in which W(h) are the unit weights of the ground above depth H. Deformation of the
mass under the vertical stress causes horizontal stresses. If the material would be water,
the vertical stress would equal the horizontal stresses (an hydraulic stress configura-
tion) because water cannot sustain shear stresses. Other masses do sustain shear
stresses and therefore the material will not completely transform the vertical stress
into equal horizontal stresses, but only a certain fraction of it depending on the
deformability of the mass. The fraction is depicted by the ratio between horizontal
(S ) and vertical (S ) stresses, without any natural (e.g. geological) or man-made in-

fluences being considered and for an area of flat topography. This is known as earth
pressure at rest, K . In an isotropic, homogeneous, linearly-elastic material the value

depends on the Poisson’s ratio (v) of the mass and K =v/(1–v). For many rock

masses, v is about 0.25 and, thus K is about 1/3 and the horizontal stresses are both

about equal to 1/3 of the vertical stress. K is higher (normally between 0.4 and 0.5)
0
for loose, non-cemented sand and under certain geological circumstances can be greater
than 1.0.
Soil and rock masses deform with time so as to minimise the shear stresses within
them. The rate of time dependent deformation is governed by factors such as the ma-
terial, the amount of discontinuities, the temperature, and the magnitude of confin-
ing stresses. Some masses may deform over millions of years while others deform
within a couple of days or years. This time delay is the reason for many in situ stress
conditions being more representative of the geological past than of the present. In par-
ticular, the overburden stress in the past has been higher than at present because the
surface of the earth has been eroded. The magnitudes of horizontal stresses are how-
ever still largely reflecting the high overburden stress of the past; hence K can be large.
0
A similar effect is known from areas that have been glaciated during the Pleistocene;
the weight of the ice is still reflected in horizontal stresses that are higher than those
calculated from the present overburden. Note this mainly applies to the horizontal
stresses as the vertical stress reduces soon after unloading – a fact that can be observed
during deep engineering excavations. Topography and tectonics can also cause the
stress orientation and magnitude to be very different from what could be expected
based on overburden thickness. Values of S near mountains, plate margins, and ac-
h
tive faults can be up to 10 times the local vertical stress and in the direction of present
day stress.
The parameter K is used for the ratio of average S over S , without concern to the
h v
origin of these stresses. Average K-values as a function of depth for various areas in
the world are shown in Fig. 10.1; here average values of S are used, but it should be

noted that considerable differences might also exist between the two horizontal stresses
at the same location (i.e. the maximum and minimum horizontal stresses), particu-
larly near tectonic active areas.
If no other information is available, some rules of the thumb for the in situ stress
configuration to expect are available (Table 10.1); these should be used with care as
the stress field may be completely different, as Fig. 10.1 shows. For a new project, it is

stress field or give personal accounts of problems during construction due to the vir-
gin stress field. If possible go underground and see whether there is evidence of aniso-
tropic stress fields, such as heavier support, or more fracturing in a particular direc-
tion, that cannot be explained by differences in the ground.
10.2.2
Man Induced Stresses
In many situations, the site for a proposed excavation is to be made in a stress field
disturbed by other excavations.
Consider Fig. 10.2, which shows a vertcal section through a synclinal ore body that
has been mined from surface downwards. The ‘crown pillars’ made to allow mining of
stopes (large ‘mining rooms’) without causing collapse of the hanging wall, were left in
place after the stope was mined. These were expected to break under the increased
stress concentrations as the mine deepened and the hanging wall was supposed to col-
lapse unto the footwall. Then the weight of the central core of the syncline would have
been spread over the whole footwall. However, the crown pillars did not collapse, but
kept transferring the weight from the central rock mass to the footwall. This resulted
in a strongly anisotropic stress field at the crown pillars, created problems with the
stability of the haulages (tunnels), and stresses on the bottom part of the syncline that
prohibited mining. A solution of the problem was found in blasting the crown pillars
causing the collapse of the hanging wall thus spreading the weight of the core over
the footwall. A modified stress field can be caused by an existing excavation or sur-
face structure; foundations of high-rise buildings may influence the magnitude and
orientation of the stress field underground where tunnels for transport may later be
excavated.
10.2.3
Stress Measurements
Stress measurements are the only reliable way to determine a stress field. Stress mea-
surements are, however, very sensitive to local variations in the ground and many
measurements may have to be done before the obtained values can be assumed reliable.
Most standard methods for measuring stresses are based on the same principle:
a volume of the ground is allowed to deform, expand due to unloading or contract
due to loading and is then either re-loaded or un-loaded until the original volume is
obtained; the loads required to do this give the original stress condition. Examples
of stress measurements are: overcoring, flat jack and dilatometer tests, and induced
fracturing.

Stress around an Underground Excavation
In general, the ground around a subsurface excavation supports itself by arching as
the ground deforms in the direction of the opening. This occurs because as the ground
moves towards the excavation the volume of space it collectively occupies decreases. This

Fig. 10.3. The roof does not

causes the blocks of rock to lock against each to produce an arch. That arching exists
can easily be shown by a simple calculation. Assume that a tunnel of 5 wide and 3 m high
has to be made at a depth of 2000 m, and the unit weight of the ground is 25 kNm–3
(Fig. 10.3). The vertical stress is then 2000 m×25 kNm–3=50 MNm–2. The force on
the roof per metre length of tunnel is: 5 m×1 m×50 MNm–2=250 MN. Hence, the
support per metre length has to take up 250 MN. A concrete pillar system is used for sup-
300 CHAPTER 10 · Withdrawal of Support by Underground Excavations
port, with a compressive strength in the order of 20 MNm–2. The surface of concrete
required is thus 250 MN/20 MNm–2=12.5 m2. However, per metre length of tunnel
there is only 5 m2 available. Hence, support is just simply impossible if the overbur-
den pressure had to be taken up by the support. Yet there are plenty of tunnels in min-
ing and civil engineering at a depth of 2000 m or more, without any support at all
because the ground is supporting itself.
10.3.1
A Circular Opening in a Linear Elastic, Homogeneous and Isotropic Medium
The stresses around a circular opening in an linear elastic, homogeneous, and isotro-
pic medium are described by the following:
(10.2a)
(10.2b)
(10.2c)
S =horizontal stress before excavation, S =vertical stress before excavation,
h v
σ r=radial stress, τ rθ=shear stress, r=excavation radius, d=distance from excava-
tion centre, θ=polar coordinate, horizontal=0°.
Examples of the stresses as a function from the distance perpendicular to the wall
and roof are given in Fig. 10.4.
The in situ stress field is a vertical stress S , and perpendicular to it a horizontal
v
stress S . Along the perimeter of the opening (d/r=1) the major principal stress (σ)
h 1
equals the tangential stress (σ θ) parallel to the excavation perimeter and perpendicu-
lar to it the minor principal stress (σ) equals the radial stress (σ). If the in situ verti-
3 r
cal stress (S v) equals the in situ horizontal stress (S h), the tangential stress (σ θ) has
the value of 2 S at d/r=1. The radial stress (σ) equals 0. The radial stress at the pe-
v r
rimeter of an excavation that is not supported has always to be 0, as otherwise the pe-
rimeter would move until σ is 0. If the in situ horizontal stress is lower than the in
r
situ vertical stress, the tangential stress in the roof may become negative, which here
means tensile (see stresses for θ=90°). Figure 10.4 also shows the magnitude of the
stress concentrations to be independent from the size of the excavation and further
shows the influence of the presence of an opening to be limited to about 4 times its
radius. The stress concentrations along the perimeter of an opening show a large in-
crease (Fig. 10.5) for non-circular openings or angular openings.

A Circular Opening in an Elasto-Plastic or Brittle, Homogeneous and
Isotropic Medium
Unfortunately for the numerical modellers who employ relationships of the sort de-
scribed in Eq. 10.2a–c, real intact rock material behaves only partially as a linear-elastic
medium whereas soil and rock masses are not linear-elastic at all. Figures 10.6a and c
show the stress-strain behaviour of ground after reaching the elastic limit: Fig. 10.6a
for an elasto-plastic mass and Fig. 10.6c for an elasto-plastic mass with brittleness.
Figures 10.6b and d show the corresponding stresses around underground openings.
The mass at the perimeter may deform plastically (Fig. 10.6b) and could squeeze into
the opening if the elastic limit is reached. If the elastic limit is reached for a material

with brittleness, the material breaks (spalling), creating a ‘broken zone’. The mass in
this zone may deform plastically and squeeze into the opening (Fig. 10.6d).
10.4
Stress Related Issues
The ground has many aspects that are not reflected in the analyses of stress outlined
above and which cause it to behave in ways that are not easy to predict quantitatively.
10.4.1
Excavations in a Discontinuous Medium
In a discontinuous medium such as the ground, the deformation, strength and failure
relationships are far more complicated than in a continuum (Hoek and Brown 1994).
In a discontinuous mass, the ground may not need to fail anymore to create disconti-
nuity planes because these are already present. Movements can take place fully or in
part along these discontinuities. New discontinuities are created only when the stresses
exceed the strength of the intact material. Squeezing or flowing of the material will
occur either if the material is soft and cohesive (for example, clay) or if the block size
of the material is small compared to the excavation (for example, shale or non-ce-
mented sand). The relation between block size and stability causes the size of an open-
ing to become important. The more discontinuities intersected by the excavation the

curves for elasto-plastic and elasto-plastic with zero-brittleness material; c, d show the corresponding
stresses around a circular opening (after Kastner 1971)
more chances there are of blocks moving or falling (Fig. 10.7). In addition to these the
discontinuous ground is also likely to be anisotropic.
10.4.2
Swelling Materials
Some materials swell if exposed to water, even that in the atmosphere. Swelling mate-
rial will deform into the excavation and change its shape and size. Swelling stresses
can be extremely high and it is often impossible to counteract them. Therefore, such
material should be sealed from either free water or the atmosphere, for example, by
gunite or shotcrete (see below), immediately after excavation. Swelling conditions can
be expected in materials containing swelling clay minerals, in particular, montmoril-

lonite, and in shales, claystones, mudstones, weathered pyroclastic deposits, and fault
gouge. Anhydrite will swell because when exposed to water it slowly converts to gyp-
sum, which has a larger molar volume.
10.4.3
Dynamic Stresses – Earthquakes
Dynamic stresses may be superimposed on the virgin stress field by earthquakes. It is
generally recognized that underground structures are less sensitive to earthquake mo-
tions than surface structures. One of the reasons for this is that the resonance frequency
of most underground structures is well above the range of frequencies common in
earthquake waves. During the passage of an earthquake wave the underground exca-
vation deforms under a combination of axial compression and extension. Tension
cracks may develop and normal stress on discontinuities may be reduced during ten-
sion phases of an earthquake wave, allowing movement of blocks in the surrounding
ground, with loss of integrity of the mass and its consequent collapse. Support sys-
tems such as bolts or wire mesh reinforced shotcrete give reinforcement to discon-
tinuous ground and support, such as concrete segments, can be connected by nuts and
bolts so that the integrity of the support they provide is not lost. Much here can be
learnt from case histories.
10.4.4
Failure Modes and Need for Support
As the forgoing sections show, an underground excavation can fail in different ways:
10.4 · Stress Related Issues 305
(cid:1) Spalling: the stresses at the perimeter of the excavation are such that the intact ma-
terial breaks (rock or firm cohesive or cemented soil); spalling of intact material can
be expected if σ θ is more than about half the unconfined compressive strength of
the intact material.
(cid:1) Gravity failure: material falls into the opening due to gravity, this may be either rock
or soil.
(cid:1) Squeezing failure: the surrounding material deforms so far into the opening that the
opening is no longer serviceable; clay, shale, or masses with many discontinuities
such as schist are susceptible to this.
(cid:1) Swelling failure: when materials swell on exposure.
Combinations of failure modes are normal; for example, a unit is squeezed in the
opening and this allows de-stressing of other units and discontinuities, which permits
gravity failure.
Support is installed in an underground excavation to keep the ground next to the
excavation walls, roof and floor, in place. Support, except for shallow underground
excavations where horizontal stresses are usually manageable, never counteracts the
virgin stresses present because arching effects will deflect most of the stresses around
the excavation. In a strong rock or cemented soil mass (e.g. strong in relation to the
virgin stress field) the radial stresses at the perimeter of the excavation are nil and
the tangential stresses are taken up by the material; the excavation is ‘self-supporting’;
failure is not reached. In weaker masses, the magnitude of the tangential stresses cause
the material in the perimeter of the void to fail and material will move into the exca-
vation causing it to deform. The material behind the collapse forms the new perim-
eter of the excavation and may subsequently also fail. This is progressive failure of the
excavation and is prevented by providing support. In shallow underground excava-
tions with either no or small horizontal stress, arching effects may not be sufficiently
developed to enable an arch to be self supporting, therefore a shallow underground
excavation may need support which actually carries the ground above the tunnel.
10.4.5
Stresses around Portals
The major and minor principal stresses along a tunnel are normally oriented tangen-
tial (around) and radial (perpendicular) to its perimeter. The intermediate principal
stress is parallel to the axes of the tunnel, much influenced by the virgin stress field
and very important for the normal stress on discontinuities perpendicular to the tun-
nel axes. Near a portal of a tunnel the stress parallel to the tunnel axes will be low and
possibly zero. Hence, near the portals there is little to no normal stress on discontinu-
ity planes oriented perpendicular, or there about, to the tunnel axes. In addition to
these it is likely that the quality of the ground near portals and the strength of
discontinuities there will be lower due to weathering. The combination of low stress
and weathered ground often causes major problems with excavating the tunnel por-
tals. Many tunnels in the world have become more expensive than expected due to
portal problems (Fig. 10.8).
306 CHAPTER 10 · Withdrawal of Support by Underground Excavations

nel axes becomes null at portal
10.4.6
Stand-Up Time and Time Effects
All ground in which the stress conditions change needs time to adjust to the new situ-
ation by deformation. When this deformation causes either expansion or shear, the
ground becomes weaker as new fractures, asperities on discontinuities shear,
discontinuities that were mated are now displaced and cement within the ground is
broken. Therefore, the sooner support is installed after excavation, the stronger the
ground remains. The time between excavation and failure, for underground excava-
tions, is called the ‘stand-up time’. Stand-up times range from negligibly short (min-
utes) to thousands of years. Stand-up time allows an excavation to be supported be-
fore failure mechanisms develop to the point where collapse commences. Most of the
mechanisms governing the time-dependent movements are only partially known and
available mathematical expressions are not reliable. One way to assess stand-up time
is by experience, which may be sustained by empirical classification systems (Chap. 4).
Time-effects cause many serious accidents underground. Many engineers, even
those working underground, do not appreciate the nature of time dependent defor-
mation. Often an excavation is considered safe because it has been standing for “some
time”. This can be a fatal error underground. It requires experience to recognise an
10.5 · Excavation Issues 307
imminent collapse; everybody should be aware that the time an underground excava-
tion has been standing is of little value to assess its safety. Most collapses are preceded
by warnings such as small movements in the surrounding ground, sounds from the
mass, or small pieces of material falling from roof or walls. These should be recog-
nized as signals that a potential danger might be at hand.
10.5
Excavation Issues
Water and ease of excavation are common issues for most underground excavations
of any great size as considerable costs can be incurred if predictions relating to either
of these are wrong.
10.5.1
Water and Underground Excavations
Water flowing into the excavation can be not only a nuisance but also a hazard. Water
pressures reduce effective stress and subsequently the shear strength of the ground.
Water pressures and flow may also cause material to be flushed into the excavation
causing overbreak and instability (Fig. 10.9). Flowing water can prevent the applica-
tion of shotcrete from good contact with the ground. Therefore, water flowing into an
excavation in large quantities has normally to be prevented. Draining is feasible if
permeability of the ground is not too high or if sealing (impermeable) layers are
present that limit the quantity of water to be drained. If the rock mass is highly per-
meable drainage will lower the groundwater table above an excavation. This is nor-
mally unacceptable for social, environmental, and geotechnical reasons. Under these
circumstances the excavation has to be sealed locally with, for example, by grouting.
Even if the water inflow is no geotechnical problem, it is not regarded as good engi-
neering to have large water inrushes into an excavation.
It is not easy to estimate water inflow into an underground excavation before the
excavation has been made. The theoretical background can be found in many books,
but to determine the nature of the groundwater regime and the permeability of the
strata is very difficult. In a homogeneous mass without discontinuities, the water will
flow via the pores between the grains. For this, reasonable estimates can be made based
on theoretical calculations. Most masses are, however, not homogeneous and not with-

sures from localized high per-
meability zones may break

tunnel reaches the zone
308 CHAPTER 10 · Withdrawal of Support by Underground Excavations
out discontinuities. Reliable estimations of the quantity of water can then only be made
from boreholes to locate these zones, packer tests in these zones and from pilot tun-
nels. Portals of tunnels may in particular be at risk because these are near to the sur-
face and the mass near portals is often more permeable because of a higher number
of discontinuities. Rainfall may then directly flow into the portal area. This problem
can be reduced by building the portal in a dry season if such a season exists.
10.5.2
Excavation
Excavations can be made in many different ways, from digging by hand to using highly
mechanised tunnel boring machines (TBMs). Excavation can be made by any type of
method whatever the ground; prisoners made escape tunnels in rocks using their bare
hands and spoons, however in commercial practice the excavation method chosen has
to be suited to the ground, available skilled labour, and the constraints on the project
from time and economics. Generally, two types of excavation method can be distin-
guished: mechanical and blasting (Fig. 10.10); both methods can be further divided
(Table 10.2). Blasting techniques were used extensively in the past, but nowadays mechani-
cal methods are more popular, having various advantages over blasting methods espe-
cially for smaller works and for reducing vibrations at ground level. ‘Specials’ noted in
Table 10.2 include methods that make use of the expansion characteristics of wood or
chemicals, the force of water under high pressure, used for jetting to erode the rock
mass, or use of sawing techniques. They are seldom used in underground excavations.
The method of excavation has a considerable influence on the quality of the pe-
rimeter of an excavation especially if high levels of stress exist. Table 10.3 gives values

tion results of SSPC or MRMR to account for the method of excavation)
310 CHAPTER 10 · Withdrawal of Support by Underground Excavations
for the damaging influence of methods of excavation on a rock mass. Natural, hand-
made, and bored excavations show fewer new mechanical discontinuities than exca-
vations made by blasting in the same rock mass, as they have not been subject to the
transient loading blasting imparts to the ground. Large excavations may not be stable
long enough for support to be installed; in these cases it is often necessary to com-
plete the excavation in sequence starting with a small part of the excavation where
loads are least, at the top, or crown, of the tunnel (Fig. 10.10 bottom).
10.6
Machine Methods of Excavation
Most civil and mining excavations underground are created by mechanical cutting and
grinding. Such methods use a mechanical device onto which drag, disc, roller, or tri-
cone bits are mounted that cut and grind into the ground (Figs. 10.11 to 10.13). These
cutting tools may be made from steel, hardened steel, tungsten, or diamond and their
damage and wear are kept to a minimum by using low forces for excavation. Excava-
tion is thus a relatively slow cutting and grinding of the ground that breaks small pieces
from the mass. The diameters of excavations are typically circular holes up to about
8 m for raise bores, and 15 m+ for tunnel boring machines. Cross-sections of shape
other than circular can be formed using a road header, which consists of a rotating
cutting wheel mounted on a modified excavator (Fig. 10.11); this can excavate any size
and form of excavation in all but the strongest of rock masses.
As all mechanical cutting and grinding methods apply low energy, and consequently
low stress levels, at any time, they generate little damage to the rock mass beyond the
perimeter of the excavation. Good control over the excavation is possible, resulting in
minimum overbreak and a smooth perimeter.
Mechanical cutting and grinding methods will excavate any ground, soil and rock,
so the question is whether the method is economical. If a rock mass consists of larger
blocks and the intact rock strength is high it will take a long time before a mechanical
cutting and grinding device has excavated the space. Secondly, the wear on cutters and
Fig. 10.11. Road header with
spherical cutters
10.6 · Machine Methods of Excavation 311
machinery may be high and consequently the costs. Until some years ago mechanical
cutting and grinding excavation techniques for large excavations were restricted to
soil and moderately strong rock masses with intact rock strength not exceeding 50 MPa.
Techniques are advancing rapidly and mechanical cutting and grinding methods are
becoming economically viable in rock masses with higher intact rock strengths and
larger block sizes. They are often used for other reasons, for example, if blasting is not
allowed for fire risk or vibrations.
10.6.1
Tunnel Boring Machines
Tunnel Boring Machines (TBMs) are mechanized, more or less automatic machines
that excavate the tunnel, provide support to the ground temporarily during excava-
tion if needed, and install permanent support where necessary (Fig. 10.10 top). The
excavated material is transported out of the tunnel by pipes, if a watery slurry, con-
veyor belt, or trains. TBMs can be thought of as long stiff machines; they have diffi-
culties going round corners so they experience sever limits with vertical and horizon-
tal gradients. This means they cannot go around an unexpected geological problem if
encountered; they have to go through it; good geological predictions are required for
TBM design and use. That is why TBMs are often specially designed for one project in
a particular type of ground. The various parts that may be included in a TBM, are:
(1) ripper or excavator, (2) cutting wheel, (3) face plates, shield support or pressure
shield, (4) grouting facilities, (5) steering assembly between cutting wheel and shield,
(6) permanent support installation facilities, and (7) foam and grease injection instal-
lations.
In a well organized project, just one person may be able to handle and oversee the
full operation. The operator can be located in the TBM, however this is not required.
The author has visited a site in Japan where the entire TBM operation for an 8 m di-
ameter concrete segment supported tunnel was run by remote control from a nice
sunny surface office by a tiny Japanese lady. Obviously, a better working environment
makes it easier to find skilled employees and keeps the salaries low, hence, improving
economic viability. Disadvantages of TBMs are the relatively (very) high initial costs
and the very costly consequences if the wrong type of TBM has been chosen. Many
examples exist of TBM projects heavily delayed and going over budget because the sub-
surface conditions were different from those initially expected; some TBMs have been
left in the ground and the already built tunnel abandoned. TBMs have become increas-
ingly versatile so that one TBM can cope with different subsurface conditions.
Dimensions
A TBM may have a length up to 50 m or more. The start of a tunnel to be made with a
TBM requires a considerable working space; not only for assembling the TBM but also
for its reaction block, against which it will jack itself (“launch”) into the ground. Gen-
erally, a space is required double the length and height of the heading machine
(Fig.10.10). TBMs can be dismantled into fairly small parts for transport, except for the
main bearing of the cutting wheel which has a maximum dimension of about 2/3 of the
diameter of the TBM. Access roads or shafts should thus allow this size to pass.
312 CHAPTER 10 · Withdrawal of Support by Underground Excavations
Stress around TBM
An opening excavated in the ground will deform with the largest deformation in the
direction of the maximum stress of the virgin stress field. For most excavation meth-
ods this is no problem as long as the deformation does not reduce the minimum re-
quired excavation dimensions. For a TBM this is different. Even relatively small de-
formations (in the order of centimetres) may cause a TBM to become stuck, or parts
of the TBM to deform. In particular, deformation of the shield may be a major prob-
lem as the sealing of the shield against the ground is reduced.
Balancing Pressures
To resist ground pressures an earth pressure balance shield (EPB) can be employed if
it is thought that the face will not be stable and sag, so permitting too much material
into the TBM and facilitating subsidence at ground level. A nearly closed cutting wheel
may prevent this. If this is not enough, for example, if the mass easily squeezes or if water
pressures are high, it is necessary to use a closed shield (using a bulkhead installed verti-
cally behind the cutting wheel, if present), in which only a relatively small opening allows
the ground to pass into the body of the TBM. The space between the bulkhead and the
face will then be under pressure, as it supports the face, and counteracts water pressures.
The shield may be a pressure shield, bentonite shield, hydro shield (Fig. 10.12), or earth
pressure balance shield (EPB) depending on how the pressure is maintained.
Fig. 10.12. TBM with hydro shield (©Voest-Alpine Bergtechnik, Austria 2000)
10.6 · Machine Methods of Excavation 313
Cutting Wheels and Heads
Cutting wheels and heads (not shaped like wheels) are required to carry the cutting tools
that will excavate the ground. These are adjusted to the type of ground to be excavated. In
soft materials, such as clay, the cutter is more a type of knife or tooth, cutting slices of the
ground. In harder ground such as rock, the cutter will be a drag-tooth or disc bit (Fig. 10.13).
Cutting wheels may act as face support if mainly closed. Water jets may be mounted on
the cutters to help excavation or to ease transport of broken material.
Jacking Systems
A TBM propels itself through the ground by the thrust from a jacking system mounted
between the TBM shield and the tunnel lining that has been assembled behind it
(Fig. 10.12). For short tunnels e.g. under railway embankments, the jacks can be posi-
tioned between a tunnel shield and a concrete installation outside the tunnel often
located in a “thrust pit”. The jacks push the support lining with the shield into the
ground (‘jacked tunnel’). Friction between the ground and support lining must be kept
to a minimum. The backfill of a concrete segment lining can be grouted. Grease or
foam may be used to reduce friction between shield and ground. Different foams can
also be used to make the excavated ground easier to handle, or to increase the stabil-
ity of the face when mini-TBMs are used, e.g. for jacking pipes.
Percussive Methods
Jackhammers and hydraulic or pneumatic hammers excavate by percussion. The de-
vices are normally mounted on machines. The length of the hammers can be up to

5 m with a diameter of about 25 cm. The force on the hammer may be substantial; large
hammers may cause considerable damage to the rock mass. Note that in Table 10.3
the adjustment factor for pneumatic hammering is in the same order as good conven-
tional blasting.
10.7
Blasting
In its most simple form, blasting consists of drilling of a series of holes that are filled
with explosive that is then detonated. The holes are drilled and blasted according to a
blast pattern that describes the location of the holes, the quantity and type of explo-
sives, and the order and delay times between the holes, as they are normally not all
blasted at the same time but with small time intervals (10 to hundreds of milliseconds).
The first holes to be blasted are normally smaller holes in a triangular or pyramidal
pattern (Fig. 10.14) in the middle of the excavation (the wedge or burn-cut) to create
space for the rock to move to when blown from the following rounds of larger produc-
tion holes. After the blast the broken pieces of the rock mass are removed (“mucking”)
and the process can start again. Diameters of holes are in order of 2.5 to 10 cm and
length in the order of 0.5 to 7 m, depending on the quality of the rock mass and type
of explosives used. Blasting in karstic rock masses requires special measures. The
quantity of explosives should be adjusted to the fact that the rock mass consists partly
out of open space or soft karst-hole filling material, and the blasting holes should be
lined as otherwise the karst holes will be filled with explosives too leading to exces-
sive over blasting. Conglomerates should also be blasted with care as the matrix to
pebbles and boulders may disintegrate on blasting so enabling the blast to hurl the
equivalent of cannon balls across any open space nearby.
10.7.1
Smooth Wall Blasting and Pre-Splitting
In smooth wall blasting the number of holes along the perimeter of the excavation is
increased, and the diameter and quantity of explosives per hole decreased (Fig. 10.14).
These holes will be blasted simultaneously as the last round. If properly executed the

10.7 · Blasting 315
excavation will be relatively smooth and half of each hole will remain visible. Over-
break will be low.
In pre-splitting the number of holes along the perimeter may be further in-
creased and the diameter decreased (Fig. 10.14). The pre-split holes are simulta-
neously blasted before the main holes and a ‘split’ along the perimeter is created
from one pre-split hole to the next. The split will act as an open discontinuity that
reflects shock waves from the main blast. Hence, the shock waves of the main holes
do not enter the mass outside the perimeter and the reflected energy helps break
the middle part of the excavation. If properly done half of each pre-split hole will
remain visible and the damage to the mass beyond the perimeter will be minimal.
Pre-splitting for full-face tunnel blasting is not very useful as stresses in the face
tighten the rock and can prevent the good development of a split. However, for sec-
ondary blasting such as widening an existing tunnel, pre-splitting may give good
results.
10.7.2
Conventional Large-Hole Blasting
Large-hole blasting makes use of blast holes with diameters of about 15 to 25 cm. The
quantity of explosives in each hole is large and the rock mass will normally be shat-
tered. It is used for underground or surface mining were damage to the surrounding
rock mass is of less concern. It is used in civil engineering when large quantities of a
rock have to be removed and vibrations are not an issue for concern.
10.7.3
Advantages and Disadvantages of Blasting
Conventional tunnel blasting is characterised by damage to the rock mass outside the
designed perimeter of the excavation. Generally, the control on the excavation size is
poor and the resulting roof, walls, and floor will not be smooth. On detonation new
discontinuities are formed and existing ones are widened; gasses discharged by the
explosion increase the loosening of the mass. The roughness of discontinuities may
be affected as asperities are sheared or crushed as rock blocks are displaced, giving
less rough and non-fitting discontinuity planes that result in lower shear strength. The
effects from blasting are reduced if special techniques are used like pre-splitting or
smooth wall blasting. These methods, however, can increase the costs considerably. In
many countries, extensive and expensive security measures are also required to pro-
tect the explosives from theft by villains.
So what are the advantages of blasting? Simply, it is an excavation method that can
be used in hard rock when other techniques are either impossible or uneconomic.
Conducted properly, blasting produces good results with minimal damage to the
ground. The quality of the blasting engineer is vital. Contracts for blasting should be
carefully drafted; often the mere fact that the contractor is paid for the quantity of
explosives or the quantity of blasted rock, lures the contractor into using maximums
of explosives to do the job as fast as possible with maximum profit, but without much
concern for the results.
316 CHAPTER 10 · Withdrawal of Support by Underground Excavations
10.8
Ground Improvement and Support
Sometimes the ground needs some help to carry itself and it is strengthened by tech-
niques of ground improvement. Ground improvement can be thought of as providing
“internal” support to a volume of ground whilst “support” is something applied exter-
nally to that volume.
Thinking on support has changed; in the past support was installed to carry the
ground but nowadays it is realized this is not always necessary, because the mass should
carry itself as far as possible. Support is only needed to help the mass carry itself. Of-
ten a thin layer of shotcrete acting as glue to keep small pieces of rock in place is suf-
ficient for arching (see Sect. 10.3) to occur whereas in the past heavy steel sets with
lots of wood timbering would have been installed to obtain the same result. Move-
ment allowed in ground that cannot support itself will normally result in a weaker mass.
Therefore, the faster support is installed the less strength is lost. It should however be
realized that some relaxation of the ground is always necessary to obtain the arching
effects that can be generated without failure and which enable the ground to carry it-
self. Generally, the time required to install support is time enough to obtain the arch-
ing effects. In some situations, it can be necessary to delay support installation or al-
low additional deformation by other means (as making special de-stressing slots)
because it is simply impossible to withstand the stresses if not done. This normally
happens if large stresses and deformation occur, as happens often in underground
mining but can also be encountered in deep tunnels through mountains in which there
is poor ground. Depending on the time available in relation to the excavation process,
it is normal to divide the types of support into: (1) pre-excavation support, including
drainage, (2) support during excavation, and (3) permanent support (Table 10.4). The
design of ground treatment and support requires the very best ground models that can
be generated. The engineering geologist needs to appreciate what is expected from the
ground by these techniques and for this reason the main techniques are briefly de-
scribed.
10.8.1
Ground Improvement
Freezing
Ground is frozen by pumping a cooling agent through a double-tube pipe system in
boreholes either from surface, a small diameter service tunnel, or from so-called feeder
holes drilled from the tunnel (Fig. 10.15); the cooling agent is pumped in the bore-
hole through the inner tube and returns through the outer tube. Water in the ground
is frozen and binds the particles and blocks together, making the mass impermeable.
It is absolutely essential that the ground contains water. Without water the mass cools,
but there is no gluing effect because ice cannot be formed. Even if only some minor
layers do not contain water, the method is questionable. The unfrozen layers will de-
form due to the expanding surrounding frozen mass and subsequently de-stress when
the surrounding layers are thawed. This may lead to stress relief throughout the whole
perimeter of the excavation and subsequent instability. The expansion of the ground

from surface, service tunnel, or
feeder holes (note that the
freezing and grouting holes, if
cored, will also give informa-
tion about ground conditions
ahead of the tunnel face)
318 CHAPTER 10 · Withdrawal of Support by Underground Excavations
may displace other nearby structures or foundations of surface structures, and sur-
face heave may be a problem if applied for shallow excavations. The method is expen-
sive.
Grouting
Grouting pumps a cement milk or resin into the ground (the ground is “grouted”). This
grout can be designed to provide mechanical strength to the ground (by bonding par-
ticles together or filling their voids with a strong material) or simply reduce its per-
meability by filling its voids. Often grouting is undertaken to achieve both these ends.
The grout is pumped into the ground from ground level, or a small diameter service
tunnel, or from feeder holes (Fig. 10.15). A large advantage of the method is that the
support is also present as permanent support after excavation. Knowledge of the per-
meability of the ground and groundwater flow is essential. If the ground has too low a
permeability, grout will not reach all locations and some areas will not be treated.
Generally, the method works very well to improve the strength and deformation char-
acteristics of the ground. Whether it will also make the ground impermeable is ques-
tionable. In many cases the milk or resin will not be homogeneously spread through
the ground and the ground will not be completely impermeable after one round of
grouting. Additional grouting rounds are then necessary to stop leakages. Special care
should be taken that the grouting is not done with too high a pressure as this will cause
the ground to break and permeability after the grout process may have increased rather
than decreased. It is important to supervise this work closely.
Grouted feeder holes (Fig. 10.15) can also be used for inserting bolts, or pipes of
steel or fibre glass into weak ground ahead of the tunnel as pre-excavation support
called Forepoling.
Caisson (or Compressed Air) Tunnelling
This is used to support water saturated weak ground and to reduce water inflows in
wet tunnels. A bulkhead is installed separating the face of the tunnel from the remain-
der of the tunnel and the air within it pressurized to counteract the hydraulic gradi-
ent that is driving water to the tunnel (Fig. 10.16). Labour and machinery necessary
for the excavation pass through an air lock in the bulkhead and work under compressed
air. The method works best in cohesive or cemented ground where pore and fissure
sizes are small (sand and silt size). Large voids and open fissures will allow the air to

10.8 · Ground Improvement and Support 319
escape and pressure to be lost. Working under compressed air is unpleasant, unhealthy
and expensive.
Gunite and Shotcrete
Gunite is a mixture of sand/cement/water sprayed onto a rock surface for waterproof-
ing. It is usually sprayed in thin layers on wire mesh that is held to the rock by bolts
and serves to give structural strength to the gunite and prevent it cracking. Shotcrete
is a quick setting mortar sprayed on the ground. It is applied in layers about 4 cm thick
at a spray velocity of about 150 ms–1 and closely follows the excavation contours. Ad-
ditives can be used that shorten the setting time allowing thicker layers to be sprayed
in one layer; fibres of plastic or steel can be added to increase the tensile strength of
the gunite. Multiple layers can build up to a final layer of (in principle) unlimited thick-
ness; however, the usual thickness is about 4 to 6 cm and the maximum is around 40
to 50 cm. Wire mesh, mats of steel, and/or steel beams may be installed between lay-
ers of shotcrete as reinforcement to give strength. Bolt support can also be added.
Shotcrete supports the mass by keeping the smallest pieces of rock in place by gluing
the mass together. This prevents small deformations becoming large movements. The
first layer can be sprayed directly after excavation to minimise deformation. Shotcrete
is presently one of the most popular forms of temporary and permanent support.
10.8.2
Support
Bolts, Dowels, and Anchors
These are three similar types of support that work by keeping the ground together
and providing reinforcement in the mass. The naming is not clearly defined, gener-
ally, an anchor has a flexible cable and is long (ranging from metres to many tens of
metres), whereas a bolt is stiff and relatively short (0.5 to 10 m). Bolts and anchors
can both be tensioned to create a compressive stress in the ground between their nut
and clamp; this increases the shear strength on surfaces so strengthening the ground
(Fig. 10.17). Bolts and anchors can be used in soil or rock masses, but are most effec-
tive in rock masses with reasonable intact rock strength and a not too small block size.
If the intact rock strength is too low, the rock mass will squeeze or shear along the
bolt or anchor, and if the block size is too small the small blocks will be squeezed out
between the bolts or anchors. In these types of ground bolts and anchors are normally
combined with netting and grouting (to be done before the bolts or anchors are in-
stalled).
The engineering geologist may be asked to advise on the length of bolting or an-
choring to be used and the tensioning to be applied. If the ground deforms it will natu-
rally tension an untensioned bolt and anchor that has a plate on its nut, but this may
take time. If the deformation is to be controlled then tension may be applied at an early
stage. The installation of these devices is therefore divided into “tensioned” and
“untensioned” Advice may also be required on the likely corrosion of the anchors and
bolts in the natural groundwater of the mass.

ponent resin (b). The rebar is forced in the hole while rotating and breaks the cartridge and mixes the
resin and catalyst components. When the deepest installed fast-setting (hardening), cartridge has set,
the rebar is tensioned. The resin contained in the other cartridges sets later, gives additional strength,
and protects the rebar from corrosion (c)
10.8 · Ground Improvement and Support 321
Bolts are fastened in the mass by cement or epoxy resin, by clamp systems (Fig. 10.17)
or by the elastic expansion of steel. Anchors are normally fastened with cement or resin.
Anchor cables have a protective sheathing against corrosion.
Bolting Patterns
Bolts can be installed in soil or rock masses as an umbrella, inclined from the tunnel
over the face as forepoling, where they serve as a pre-excavation support. Bolts can
also be applied to stabilise the face of an excavation if required. For radial bolting dif-
ferent opinions exist for how bolts should be installed: either perpendicular to as many
discontinuities as possible (Fig. 10.18a) or just perpendicular to the wall, roof, or floor
of the excavation (Fig. 10.18b).
The first is often difficult to execute and requires skilled labour. The later is easy, even
by unskilled labour. Bolts should be installed perpendicular to the discontinuities where
one clear discontinuity set exists. Most masses contain more than one set and it will be
impossible to install the bolts perpendicular to all discontinuities. The installation of
bolts perpendicular to the walls and roof is easier and cheaper so that more bolts can
be installed and the final support is normally effective. Bolting installed perpendicular to
discontinuities where a limited amount of mass is unstable is called ‘spot bolting’
(Fig. 10.18c). Shotcrete and concrete can be used as required (Fig. 10.18d).
Bolts with Straps, Cables and Nets
Metal straps, tensioned cables and nets can be placed between bolts to keep interven-
ing bolts in place; cables force the blocks of the mass together to create a tighter struc-

322 CHAPTER 10 · Withdrawal of Support by Underground Excavations
ture and nets prevent severely broken rock masses from unravelling. They tend to be
used with strong but broken rock. Their installation follows the excavation perimeter
as far as possible, is labour intensive and time consuming.
Steel Support
Steel support exists in two forms: flexible and fixed. The flexible steel support, nor-
mally in the form of so-called ‘yielding steel arch sets’, are able to deform and there-
fore release the stresses in the rock mass. Bolts keeping the steel parts together can
regulate the yield strength of the arch. The support is suitable for environments were
large stresses are expected that cannot be stopped economically; mostly in mining.
The stress on the steel arch should everywhere be about the same. If not, bending and
buckling of the arch occurs and the support fails. Small pieces of timber or another
flexible material between the mass and the steel are used to spread the load uniformly
to the steel. When the major part of the stress relief and deformations has occurred
the arch sets can be covered with shotcrete or concrete (Fig. 10.18e).
Concrete Support
Reinforced concrete support is used if large stresses are expected and movements are
not allowed. Pre-fabricated plates and segments (Fig. 10.18f) or concrete formed by
pouring behind shuttering, may be used. The first will act as support immediately af-
ter installation whereas the second will only start working if the concrete develops its
strength within 28 days after pouring. It should be noted that the space between the
concrete segments and the ground has to be filled with grout or concrete, however,
this too will need some time to obtain strength. Behind many TBMs are systems for
installing pre-cast concrete tunnel lining segments and backfilling them to give the
support required.
Cut-and-Cover
Cut-and-cover first makes a trench into which the tunnel is then built, and finally cov-
ered with the excavated material. A trench with deep walls can be made by installing
large size overlapping concrete piles and diaphragm walls, excavating the ground be-
tween them, installing the floor and roof of the tunnel, and backfilling with the exca-
vated material.
Timber
This has been used extensively as support in the past; nowadays timber support in
civil engineering is limited. Timber is used in the form of beams, or as blocks of wood
in combination with steel or other support. Timber is very compressible and can de-
form greatly before it will break. This makes timber very suitable in locations were
large displacements (and forces) need to be controlled, for example, in mining. This
compressibility makes timber a very poor form of support from a geotechnical point
of view. The surrounding ground can move thus causing loss of structure and reduc-
tion of shear strength along discontinuities. Timber rots with time and has to be re-
10.9 · Site Investigation for Underground Excavations 323
placed regularly; this allows relaxation of the ground and further movement and loss
of strength. When rotting, it uses the oxygen in the excavation; a hazardous atmosphere
can exist in poorly ventilated underground spaces.
10.8.3
New Austrian Tunnelling Method (NATM)
The New Austrian Tunnelling Method (NATM) has become very popular in recent years
and been applied for parts of the Channel Tunnel between France and Britain, and for
many tunnels in Germany and Austria. The NATM (Müller 1978; Pacher et al. 1974;
Rabcewicz and Golser 1972) requires the designer to encourage the rock to carry as
much of the load as it safely can be allowed to do providing support only where deemed
to be necessary. It involves characterisation and classification of the ground, rock mass
modelling, and construction adjusting in real time to the ground deformations moni-
tored. This is done by using semi-flexible support with a closed invert (tunnel floor),
that may consist of steel arches or rock bolts and wire mesh with sprayed concrete
installed directly after excavation to minimise movements in the rock mass. The time
of installation may be delayed to allow maximum arching effects to develop. It is an
extremely sophisticated method of excavation that can go seriously wrong because the
support should be adjusted to the circumstances encountered while tunnelling is in
progress. Therefore, the system requires contracts to be drafted so that contractors
are able to immediately install adjusted support (e.g. without time consuming con-
tract negotiations with the client and consultants) while the work is ongoing. In prac-
tice NATM is a combination of methods and methodologies that already existed but
have been grouped together as a ‘tunnelling method’ (Kovári 1994). Various modifi-
cations, adjusted to local circumstances, have been developed worldwide. Many claim
to follow the NATM system without exactly knowing what the system incorporates, as
witnessed by the collapse of the Heathrow Express Link underground railway line in
1994. The investigation after the collapse showed that support installed was at some
locations considerably less than prescribed in the design. This has raised questions
on the correctness of the NATM philosophy for arranging the installation of support
in such a way that the client has no direct control during the work. The method also
makes severe demands upon engineering geologists because the ground model re-
quired is NOT that of the ground “as investigated” but as investigated and allowed to
deform a little. Every measured geotechnical parameter changes with deformation –
so what IS the character ground through which these tunnels are being built? Prob-
ably nobody knows!
10.9
Site Investigation for Underground Excavations
The object of site investigations for underground excavations must be to recover in-
formation adequate enough to anticipate problems of excavation, water inflow, sup-
port and future behaviour of the materials. Extensive use should be made of conven-
tional geological survey methods applied to a large area surrounding the site in order
to understand the geology and to view the strata likely to be encountered in the exca-
vation en-mass rather than only in samples taken from boreholes. Geophysical meth-
324 CHAPTER 10 · Withdrawal of Support by Underground Excavations
ods may be useful, particularly cross-hole shooting between investigation boreholes
and, for excavations underwater, continuous seismic profiling. Considerable attention
must be given to portals as these pass through the weakest and most permeable ground
conditions likely to be encountered and often involve going through landslides. It is
extremely useful to visit other underground workings nearby, talk to miners or con-
sultants and contractors involved in the workings, and read publications relating to
them. An underground work nearby is in fact a large true-scale test of what is going to
be done and can give priceless information on possible virgin stress field problems,
types of support and excavation methods, problems with support and stability. The
author has noted that such visits are seldom done, probably because junior engineer-
ing geologists are afraid to show their lack of experience or are afraid that the infor-
mation will be refused because of company confidentiality. In general, however, the
atmosphere of openness and non-secrecy is remarkably larger in underground works
than in surface works
The factors to be studied in a site investigation may be summarized below:
1. geological conditions with particular reference to lithology and structure, includ-
ing faulting and the orientation and spacing of discontinuities;
2. engineering properties of the materials to be excavated and supported, with particu-
lar reference to strength and deformability of intact material and discontinuities, to
abrasion on cutting tools, and squeezing and swelling;
3. hydrogeology;
4. stability of portals and access shafts;
5. natural hazards such as earthquakes, temperature underground, dangerous gasses,
avalanches over portal areas and the like.
A factor often forgotten is the mobilisation of equipment and material to the project
site and the availability of appropriate skilled labour. It may be satisfying to choose a
state-of-the-art ground investigation, but if it and its labour have to travel far to reach
site or if a new road has to be built to access site, transport and labour costs may well
rule out the preferred methods. It is therefore a good idea for the engineering geolo-
gist to check available local resources before the “equipment stage” of site investiga-
tion is decided; a telephone directory, a few telephone calls, and Internet may be very
informative.
10.9.1
Initial Estimates
The ground should be divided in geotechnical units, based on the geotechnical prop-
erties and the cost per unit of the work done in that unit should be approximately
calculated, if required for different alternative sites or routings. Choice of excavation
method and type of support is largely based on experience, but choices should be jus-
tified. Rock mass classification systems supply predictions for suitable support in vari-
ous ground conditions (Barton 1988, 2000; Bieniaswki 1989; Carranza-Torres and
Fairhurst 2000; Laubscher 1990; Laughton and Nelson 1996) and as discussed in
Chap. 4. The key-block theory (Goodman 1995) may be used to predict likely bolt and
anchor loads and lengths. It is advisable to use more than one system or method of
10.9 · Site Investigation for Underground Excavations 325
prediction, as these do not always come to the same recommendations. The differences,
however, may indicate which system or method is the most suitable for a particular
project and ground. Some of the rock mass classification systems are linked to a “stand
up time” that depends upon rock class and tunnel span and will indicate how quickly
support has to be applied after excavation.
An indication of the type of excavation method to use can be based on the graphs
published in the literature (e.g. Franklin et al. 1971), but should be refined by data from
the manufacturers of excavation equipment and explosives for the project design and
construction phases. Choice of explosives is often limited to the explosives manufac-
tured locally as long transport or importing explosives is cumbersome, time consum-
ing, costly, and often just impossible. Ground properties required for the choice of TBM
design can best be derived from the various manufacturers of TBMs, all of whom have
websites showing the latest developments and are quite prepared to provide additional
information (e.g. Fig. 10.19). The designers will want to know whether the ground
needs to be supported, the water pressures to be expected and the strength of the
ground to be excavated. An estimation of production rates in rock may also be made
with the QTBM system, which is based on Barton’s Q-system rock classification sys-
tem (Barton 2000, 2005). The International Tunnel Association (ITA) provides useful
publications on TBMs.
10.9.2
On-going Investigations
Site investigations do not stop once tunnel construction has begun. It is now standard
good practice to have continuous recording of geological conditions encountered as
the tunnel progresses. Information is continually re-interpreted to give a better idea
of what lies ahead. In some tunnels, ‘probing ahead’ is undertaken to establish the na-
ture of the ground to be excavated in the next phase of tunnelling. Figure 10.20 shows

a traditional way of recording tunnel geology encountered. The top part shows the
geotechnical units and the lower part shows the main properties for the tunnel sup-
port design. This type of section gives a fast overview of the whole tunnel, however, it
is only a section and provides only details along one particular line. More sophisti-
cated means for visualising a tunnel, the properties of the ground, and calculating and
visualising costs are possible with the use of 3D-GIS programs (Fig. 10.21).
10.9.3
Site Investigation for Surface Effects of Tunnelling
Tunnels in soft ground will give rise to surface subsidence if crown settlement is al-
lowed to proceed unchecked. Accidental inflows of water bearing non-cohesive ground
into the tunnel can cause surface subsidence. In hard ground blasting in shallow tun-
nels may cause damage to buildings at surface. Blasting tests and vibration measure-
ments should be carried out before the tunnel is too far advanced to obtain the best
blasting system and pattern possible for the least surface disturbance compatible with
good driving progress. It is prudent to have an inspection (with photographic records)
of surface property before tunnelling commences and to plot surface effects onto the
geological map of the tunnel route as tunnelling proceeds.
10.10
Subsidence
This is an extensive subject and is treated here in two parts; subsidence over tunnels
and subsidence over mines.
10.10.1
Subsidence due to a Single Tunnel
Tunnels may cause surface subsidence. The amount of subsidence encountered depends
on the volume of ground that is excavated in excess of the volume of the void created

distribution of CPT cone resistance values, with boreholes showing geotechnical units and two cut-planes

328 CHAPTER 10 · Withdrawal of Support by Underground Excavations
(ground loss), relaxation of the ground surrounding the excavation, the depth of the
tunnel below surface, and the horizontal distance of the point of subsidence measure-
ment from the tunnel centreline. Surface subsidence due to a single tunnel can be rela-
tively small because modern types of excavation and support are designed to minimise
ground loss and relaxation. A first approximation of subsidence over a tunnel can be
made with an inverted error function (Peck 1969):
(10.3)
in which S is the surface subsidence at a horizontal distance x from the centreline,
x
S is the maximum subsidence above the crown of the tunnel, and x is the distance
max
from the centreline. i=KH in which K is dependent on the ground characteristics,
generally 0.4–0.6 in cohesive material and 0.25–0.45 in non-cohesive material, and H
is depth of the centreline below surface. S can be approximated (Leca et al. 2000)

max s s l
V is the factor of ground loss. V is to be estimated based on type of support and work-
l l
manship.
10.10.2
Subsidence due to Mining
While the contribution of mining to the development of society may be demonstrated
readily, mining has also had unfortunate consequences. Early mines in bedded deposits
removed the deposit leaving pillars of ground to support the mine from collapse. Later
techniques removed all the material, allowing the mine roof to collapse in a controlled
and, for the miners, a safe way. Mines working mineral veins extracted these from the
surrounding ground by a variety of techniques. Whatever the technique used the im-
mediate or later collapse of the mine opening generally disrupted the rock mass and
produced some degree of surface subsidence. As well as this, most mines have shafts
or adits to allow access to the material to be worked and these too collapse once aban-
doned.
10.11
Present Mining
A difference should be made between mining bedded, almost horizontal deposits, such
as gypsum and coal, and mining of ore, which may also be in horizontal deposits, but
is often in more irregular or steeply dipping deposits.
10.11.1
Mining Sub-Horizontal Deposits
Most of the problems associated with present and recent mining of sub- horizontal
bedded deposits stem from the extraction of coal in so-called ‘long wall’ mining. Coal
10.11 · Present Mining 329
is extracted by digging machinery in “panels” that may be two to three hundred metres
wide and kilometres long (Fig. 10.22a). Extraction may advance from either tunnels
at the access end of the panel or between the tunnels driven to the full panel length.
Total extraction permits the strata above the seam to collapse into the mining void
and this produces surface subsidence. Long wall mining methods produce almost
immediate subsidence at ground level, which is usually complete within a short time
after mining has finished; there seems to be little long-term significant residual sub-
sidence associated with this form of extraction.
The extent of this surface subsidence is greater than the area mined. Its limits are
defined by the angle of draw (Fig. 10.22b), which depends upon the geology above the
seam, but in rock is commonly about 35°. If rock is overlain by a substantial thickness
of soil overburden, the angle of draw in the soil will depend upon soil properties, but
will be greater than that in rock. The subsidence trough resulting from working a hori-
zontal seam under a flat landscape is illustrated in Fig. 10.22b and c and shows a com-
plex waveform. The maximum vertical subsidence is usually less than the height of
the mining void, perhaps about 90%, the remainder being taken up by the opening of

discontinuities within the collapsed mass (a phenomenon called bulking). It has been
found that the maximum subsidence is only achieved if the ratio of panel width (w)
to panel depth (d) exceeds about 1.4. If w/d is less than 1.4 it is described as sub-criti-
cal, if w/d≈1.4 as critical, and if w/d>1.4 as super-critical.
Subsidence Damage
Figure 10.22c shows the effects of the subsidence wave passing under a row of houses.
House 1 has yet to be affected. House 2 has risen slightly and its foundations are in
tension. House 3 is tilted and its foundations are in compression, while House 4, as-
suming it has survived tension, compression and tilting, is now vertical and on level
but subsided ground. Mining must stop somewhere and should that be at the point
shown in Fig. 10.22c, Houses 2 and 3 would be permanently in the condition shown.
The damage to structures depends much on the amount of strain suffered by the struc-
ture as the result of the foundation ground lengthening or shortening. For uniform
strain the change in length will depend on the original length of the structure (the
longer the structure the greater the change), but that change, while small, will tend to
be concentrated at weak points in the structure such as doors and windows. Thus, the
amount of damage will depend upon strain, length, and design of structure. The Na-
tional Coal Board of Great Britain has published a graph relating damage to strain
and structure length (Fig. 10.23) and Table 10.5 briefly details the type of damage
occurring in each class of damage.
Reducing Damage
Mining methods may be adapted to reduce damage. If the mining void is not allowed to
completely cave but, in the process of mining, is wholly or partially backfilled, subsidence
will be reduced. If the panel width to depth ratio is arranged to be less than 1.4, maxi-
mum subsidence will not be achieved. If two seams, one above the other, are being worked
at the same time it is possible, by harmonic mining, to so arrange mining progress that
the ground tension from one is cancelled out by the ground compression from another.
While the mining procedures outlined may reduce damage, there may well still be some
damage. In old structures, appropriate reinforcement before mining commences may
reduce damage. In new structures, engineering design will aid damage reduction.
Most designs aim to isolate the structure from ground strains and reinforce it
against tilt damage. In ordinary buildings, construction on rigid raft foundations is
common and trenches, with a flexible infill, sunk around the building to below foun-
dation depth may isolate the building from ground strains. Long structures may be
split into smaller structural units linked by joints filled with flexible materials. Large
structures, if likely to be subject to several phases of mining over a number of years,
may incorporate jacking pockets in split cellular raft foundations to compensate for
tilt. There are designs to ameliorate subsidence damage for almost all types of struc-
ture. Pipelines, for water, gas, sewage and oil are particularly important for if they are
broken in zones of tension their leakage may have major consequences in the long term.
Thus leaking water pipes could initiate a landslide, while slight gas leaks into an in-
frequently used cellar could be a source of explosions.

Subsidence Forecasting
The National Coal Board has produced data charts and calculation techniques, based
on observation and experience, to allow accurate forecasts of subsidence from pro-
posed mine workings to be made (Whittaker and Reddish 1989). Forecasting subsid-
ence, however, does require accurate geological knowledge of the area to be mined.
The presence of faults is particularly important, because their reactivation above mines,
promoted by mining, may considerably modify the subsidence profile (Fig. 10.24). The
presence of such faults should be detected before mining begins, for they would influ-
ence mine design. Any area likely to develop a subsidence scarp should be avoided for
new construction and the engineering geologist should find the fault outcrop at rock
head. This would be influenced by the thickness of overburden over rock head and
any change of dip of the fault between mine and surface.

10.11.2
Mining Sub-Vertical Deposits
Hydrothermal deposits of ore often occur as veins and lobes that have a steep dip. They
are extracted by many methods and subsidence due to such ore mining depends on
the type of mining method used (extensive descriptions of different mining methods
can be found in Hustrulid 1982). Block caving or undercutting methods, where a
hole is created at depth and the ore excavated into it and transported to the sur-
face, will give similar results as long wall mining because the ground above the
ore collapses onto the footwall, however, the extent of the area is mostly far smaller
than that in sub-horizontal mining and hence the surface subsidence will be less
manifest than in long wall mining of, say, coal. Cut and fill techniques reduce subsid-
ence generally to acceptable quantities with low subsidence gradients. Open stoping
or sub-level stoping creates stopes (caves) with dimensions that can be over 100 m high,
50 m wide, and 30 m thick, can give serious and uncontrollable subsidence problems.
If these stopes remain open after mining a large amount of open space remains in the
subsurface, which is without any form of control. The crown pillars and subsequently
the stopes themselves collapse with time, often with a domino effect. This can cause a
series of local earthquakes and very large surface displacements (up to tens of metres
in a few minutes for near-surface stopes). Even if the crown pillars are destroyed af-
ter mining so that the hanging wall has collapsed, movements in the ground above
the stopes may continue for a long time because the total rock mass above the
stopes need not settle immediately; after collapse of the hanging wall, cave like open
spaces can migrate upwards. Hence, local earthquakes with large surface movements
can be expected for a long time after mining has ceased. Later backfilling or grouting
from surface is generally not economic because of the large volumes involved. Areas
undermined with open stoping are therefore to be avoided for development and open
stoping, without immediate backfilling of the stopes after mining, is no longer per-
mitted in many countries; however, in some countries, notably in Africa and South
America, working and abandoned open stope mines, without backfill, may be encoun-
tered.

Past Mining
Mining methods used at the present were also used in the past and much of what is
said in the previous sections is just as relevant to former mines that are now aban-
doned. However, mining is as old as man and very old workings of different kinds re-
main awaiting the unwary engineering geologist. The subsidence caused by these old
mine workings is now considered.
10.12.1
Bell Pits
Historically, coal mining began with the selective working of the most attractive seams
at their most accessible positions (normally their outcrops) and gradually extended
to greater depths and to thinner seams with the progress of technology. After the sur-
face excavation of coal at the outcrop, the first attempt at underground mining was
the ‘bell pit’, a shallow shaft (seldom more than 10 m deep with a diameter usually about
1 to 2 m.) expanded at its base by undercutting into the seam once it had been reached
to give a bell-shaped cross-section (Fig. 10.25a). Radial mining from the bottom of
the shaft was undertaken until the area of extraction was such that natural or artifi-
cial support was not feasible. Sometimes about three to six short radial headings were
driven from the base of the pit (Fig. 10.25b). Stone age bell pits are believed to have
been originally put down to exploit flint stones and the method subsequently adopted
for the mining of coal as well as other materials; it was commonly used until the sev-
enteenth century. A whole progression of bell-pits may often delineate the coal seam
outcrop and cones of waste around the shafts may still be visible in open country and
on air photographs. The surface instability problems arising from this form of work-
ing can be compared to those of old mine shafts. It must be assumed that bell pits were
not backfilled when abandoned. No records of the location of bell pits were kept and
often only the irregular ground surface betrays their presence.

10.12.2
Room and Pillar Workings
The oldest form of true underground mining, with the emphasis on driving headings
in the seam, rather than on sinking shafts, is that in which the mineral (most com-
monly coal or limestone) was removed from a grid of intersecting headings, leaving
more or less regularly spaced pillars to support the roof, at least during the working
life of the mine. The room and pillar method consists basically of two sets of road-
ways driven in the seam, roughly at right angles to each other (Fig. 10.25c). For coal
extraction, room widths of between 1.8 and 4.6 m appear to have been the norm be-
fore the last century and prior to the mid-nineteenth century, the room and pillar
method was almost universally employed in Great Britain. In later and more devel-
oped variants, on reaching the economic or legal limits of the mine, the pillars were
robbed or removed in succession by pillar robbing (Fig. 10.25d) to such an extent that
they crushed under their overburden load unless there was a requirement to prevent
surface subsidence. Often illegal pillar robbing took place without concern for the con-
sequences.
Collapse
Room and pillar mines are subject to long-term deterioration of both pillars and
roof as a consequence of weathering and creep. Collapse may take place hundreds
of years after abandonment of the mine. Where mining was active, it was usually
outside town boundaries, but the abandoned mine may now lie beneath areas newly
developed for housing and industry associated with the expansion of the town or
city. Thus, many towns and cities whose initial growth was a consequence of active
mining now face the hazards from the potential collapse of abandoned mines be-
neath them.
Roof Behaviour
At the time of mining, the roof may be controlled by temporary support which, on
removal or deterioration, transfers the full strata load to the rock span forming the
roof. The resistance of this beam depends on a number of factors including its tensile
strength, dimensions, and freedom from discontinuities. The dimensions of the strata
beam are determined mainly by the incidence of bedding planes and joints. The former
define the thickness or depth of the beam while the latter affect its ability to behave as
a uniform structural member.
Given the thickness of the rock beam and knowledge of its tensile strength it is
possible to calculate the theoretical maximum span of the beam between pillars. A
single joint in any such span, transforms the beam into two cantilevers that will tend
to sag from the two abutments until the upper parts of the joint surface are in tight
contact and a “wedging” effect supports the beam (Fig. 10.26a). Where two or more
joints occur in a span, that portion of the beam between the joints is held only by the
friction of the joint surfaces (Fig. 10.26b). A downward divergence of joints allows the
block to fall out easily (Fig. 10.26c); downward convergence will tend to hold blocks
in place (Fig. 10.26d).
10.12 · Past Mining 335
Fig. 10.26. The influence of
joints on roof stability
Given a set of conditions in a mine roadway where the immediate beam of roof strata
is unstable, it then becomes necessary to consider the response of the overlying and
succeeding beams. If the stability is largely joint-determined, the failure-process will
tend to pass upwards until prevented by changing ground conditions. Where, how-
ever, the stability is largely determined by the tensile strength and dimensions of the
beam, the breaks from the collapse of succeeding beams will tend to encroach into
the mining opening and produce a natural arch. In practice, however, most instances
of roof collapse contain an element of both beam failure and joint control and the fi-
nal form will depend on the relative importance of these two processes. The maxi-
mum span length (L) for a layer of rock can be expressed as:
(10.4)
where σ is the tensile strength of the rock, t is the thickness of the layer and W is its unit
weight.
Void Migration
Progressive collapse of lithologically similar rocks spanning a void will lead to an
upward migration of the void, which may reach ground level, giving rise to a sinkhole
(sometimes known as a crown hole, chimney, or sitt) (Fig. 10.27). The height to which
a void might migrate, or collapse take place, is of the utmost concern with regard to
the use of the land above the workings for building construction. These processes
depend for their progress on the support the fallen material can give to the roof. When
this occurs, usually due to the bulking of the fallen material, the process is brought to
an end and the system becomes stable.
Bulking
This can be expressed as the ratio of the volume occupied by broken rock mass to the
volume occupied by the same weight of rock when intact. The bulking factor (B) var-

ies with rock type and for sandstones it may be about 1.5 and for soft shales and mud-
stones 1.2. If the height of a working is h, the theoretical maximum height H to which
a collapse can penetrate above the roof of the working is given by:
(10.5)
Provided that the overlying beam of strata can carry any future ground loading, a
surface instability problem will then arise only if the fallen material is removed so
permitting collapse to continue. The inclination of the mine opening will influence
this process for when the incline is small the collapse material will tend to rest where
it falls but where the dip exceeds the natural angle of repose, the material will tend to
roll away and collect at lower levels. Observations suggest that crown holes are rare
when the rock cover above the worked seam is more than about four times the height
of the workings. For general guidance only, a thickness of strata above a seam equal
to six times the height of the working can probably be regarded as defining a zone to
which void migration is confined in all but exceptional circumstances.
10.13
Mine Stability
When the ground above old mines is to be developed the ability of the mine to sup-
port the ground above them for another 60 to 100 years has to be assessed. If there is
doubt about this ability the mined area below the development may have to be back-
filled. Failure usually starts because old pillars begin to collapse.
10.13 · Mine Stability 337
10.13.1
Pillar Failure
A single pillar will fail when its strength drops below the level of the imposed stress.
Failure may occur either by slow yielding or sudden collapse, but in either case a por-
tion of the load the pillar has been carrying is transferred to adjoining pillars, by arch-
ing within the overburden. If the magnitude of the transferred load is sufficiently high,
the adjoining pillar will also fail, causing still another redistribution of load. Succes-
sive pillar failure (the domino effect) and repositioning of the arch continues until the
overburden is no longer able to span the distressed mine zone, and fails either by shear
at the periphery of the distressed zone or by flexure. The sides of the collapse arch
may then move into the depression to give a subsidence trough whose extent is re-
lated to the angle of draw (Fig. 10.22).
Pillar Strength
The strength of a pillar depends upon its size and geometry, weakness in the pillar
(fractures, bedding planes, clay veins, etc.) and the intact strength of the rock itself.
Many formulae have been developed to calculate the strength of cubic pillars, usually
incorporating the parameters of pillar width (W), pillar height (H), and unconfined
compressive strength σ. Pillar strength may be calculated by the formula:
c
(10.6)
where σ=pillar strength, N is a correction for the difference in shape between

angular cross-section specimen (like a pillar) of rock mass such that no further change in
height produces any change in strength. This is clearly related to the frequency and char-
acter of discontinuities in the rock mass. For limestone pillars in the Netherlands, which
may not have the same shape all over the pillar, it is suggested (Bekendam and Price 1993):
(10.9)
where A is the pillar base area and C the pillar perimeter.
Estimation of Collapse Potential
Goodman et al. (1980) have developed a method to evaluate the collapse potential over
abandoned room and pillar mines. This method can be used if a map is available show-
ing the locations and dimensions of rooms and pillars, as abandoned. Stress on pil-
lars may be calculated by the tributary area method (Fig. 10.28). This assumes that each
pillar, with plan area Ap is loaded by a volume of ground of plan area Av bounded
laterally by vertical planes extending up to surface and located at half room width
around each pillar. The method is probably as good as the data available in these studies
and the factor of safety of a pillar (F) is given by:
s
(10.10)
If some fall below unity, or an assigned value of F, they may be considered to no
s
longer carry load, which must then be redistributed to adjacent pillars by a recalcula-

10.13 · Mine Stability 339
tion using the relevant areas. The process is repeated until all pillars with a factor of
safety below the assigned value are identified. The procedure serves to identify those
pillars that are most likely to collapse. Should the project be to build a structure on
ground above the mine, the stresses imposed by that structure may be added to the
ground load on the pillars to assess its influence on pillar stability.
This approach requires a plan of the mine in its present condition. If old mine plans
are available it is often difficult to locate where the mine is relative to present surface
features, the mine plan may not be accurate, and illicit pillar robbing may have taken
place after formal mine closure. Consequently, before any reasonably accurate pillar
stability assessment of this type can be made, the mine must be surveyed. In wet mines
this is particularly difficult because most have been flooded after closure, and pump-
ing out the mine is hazardous for changes in effective stress may initiate collapse.
10.13.2
Mine Stability Analysis
In most mines the pillars show varying degrees of deterioration evidenced by crack-
ing, which may be used as a basis for a deterioration classification of which an ex-
ample is given in Fig. 10.29a. Here pillars range, with increasing cracking, from the
un-cracked pillar (Class I) to the completely failed pillar containing many cracks, lat-
eral spalling, giving it an hourglass form, and sometimes showing evidence of compres-
sion (Class IV). Pillar cracking and shortening may be also associated with roof col-
lapse. This may result from failure of weaker bands lying above the immediate roof beam

ers in roof beam; c upward progression of pillar cracks severs beam ends
340 CHAPTER 10 · Withdrawal of Support by Underground Excavations
(Fig. 10.29b) and by upward progression of pillar cracks into the end of the roof beam
(Fig. 10.29c); each increases the intensity of load on the pillar. The cracked pillars are
progressing to failure and redistributing their overburden load to adjacent pillars,
which may lead to a domino-like progression to general failure. The stability analysis
of a mine that can be entered requires the mapping of much information to enable
that analysis to be made.
10.13.3
After Effects of Mining
Mining breaks the ground, reduces its strength and deformability and increases its
permeability. The engineering geology of mined ground is extremely complex and can
be time dependent; it is some of the most difficult ground in which to engineer.
Loss of Structure
In all mining methods, except those where backfill has been applied directly after
mining, an open space has been allowed to collapse. This causes the ground between
the working and ground level to become loosened, which may affect foundation-bear-
ing capacity and settlement. This loosening and any relict stress still present in the
mass will significantly influence underground excavations in the mass. Knill (1973)
has described problems encountered when tunnels were driven through coal bearing
Carboniferous rocks under the River Tyne in north-eastern England. Subsidence from
past mining had opened discontinuities in the rock mass with faults and steep cracks
infilled by alluvium, which lead to extensive water inflows and rock falls in the tun-
nels and very difficult tunnelling conditions.
Rising Groundwater
Many mines have closed in recent decades and water, which was continually pumped
out to keep them dry while in operation, is now returning to flood them. With flood-
ing, rebound was measured at locations on the surface that had previously subsided;
Fig. 10.30 shows the uplift experienced at a survey point above one of the areas once
mined for coal in South Limburg, The Netherlands, following the rise in level of mine
water. The maximum values of uplift and mine water rise on the graph are those that
were expected as a consequence of a further reduction of pumping in 1994. Such mine
water rises and uplifts may have serious consequences. Apart from any damage to sur-
face structures from the uplift strains, there is a risk of collapse of once dry abandoned
room and pillar mines and old mine shafts. The magnitude of uplift that may occur
following mine abandonment can be estimated. For coal longwall mining this may be
done using Bekendam and Pottgens (1995):
∆h=hD ∆ (10.11)
m p
where h is thickness of the zone of disturbed rock, taken as four times the seam thick-
ness; D is uniaxial dilation coefficient (Pa–1) of the disturbed rock mass, and ∆p is
m
the increase of pore pressure (Pa) within the disturbed rock mass.
10.13 · Mine Stability 341
Fig. 10.30. Surface uplift as a consequence of rising mine water (after Bekendam and Pottgens 1995)
Much of this groundwater can have a very unpleasant chemistry as it has come into
contact with minerals that have been exposed to decades of oxidisation in the mine
air; it is often acidic and can be mildly radioactive. Its movement is hastened by the
looseness of the ground above the mine where discontinuities are now open. The per-
meability of these is approximately proportional to the cube of their aperture; in other
words a small increase in fracture opening produces a large increase in fracture per-
meability.
Foundations over Undermined Areas
There are two main options to build safely over undermined areas. These are:
(cid:1) to take the foundations to below the workings,
(cid:1) to fill the workings to prevent their collapse.
The first case is only feasible if one seam is worked at shallow depth; then the work-
ings may be excavated out and standard foundations placed on strata below them.
Alternatively, a structure may be supported on bored and cast-in-place piles taken to
a suitable bearing stratum below the workings. In such a case the piles must be ‘sleeved’
with a flexible material, such as bitumen, between the pile and the surrounding ground
so that if the mine collapses (for reasons entirely unrelated to the construction) the
collapsing strata will not impart extra frictional load to the piles. One hazard in the
use of such piled foundations is that the piling process, or other changes, might en-
courage new collapse in the workings and consequential subsidence. Moreover, if the
seam is dipping, collapse of the workings may laterally load the piles causing them to
fail by buckling or shear.
Infilling the workings is usually considered the best option and, if the mines can-
not be entered, this may be done through boreholes from the surface. Various fluid
342 CHAPTER 10 · Withdrawal of Support by Underground Excavations
and fluidised infilling materials have been used, ranging from sand and fly ash to
clay, but aerated concrete is generally favoured. If the mines are extensive, the fluid
infill may spread beyond the area to be treated, so the first step in any infill op-
eration from surface is to construct a peripheral dam bounding the infill area. This
may be done by closely spaced large diameter boreholes into which fine gravel is
poured to give a barrier of overlapping gravel mounds in the mine which may later
be grouted. More widely spaced holes are then bored, usually on a grid pattern,
for the introduction of the infill material that will support pillars and roof. To
complete the work more fluid grout can be injected from the infill boreholes to
fill up any opened joints or bedding planes that might impair the bearing capac-
ity of the foundation ground.
The area of the mine filled is that which might be influenced by stress from engi-
neering construction. This area may be estimated conservatively using a 45° angle from
surface (Fig. 10.31). Such work is expensive; many multi-storey buildings constructed
to give extra housing in Britain in the 1960s were chosen to be multi storey to reduce
the cost of foundation treatment per dwelling when they had to be built on under-
mined areas.
Mine Shafts
The minimum safe distance for locating multi-storey blocks from open or poorly
filled shafts depends on the nature of the surface deposits and their thickness.
The minimum would be a distance equal to the depth of the superficial deposits,
though this might require modification if sensitive clays or waterlogged silts
were present. Such shafts sometimes can be plugged at depth but if they cannot
be filled, may be made safer by the installation of a circular retaining wall around
the shaft.
Fig. 10.31. Infilling old mine workings. The area to be infilled is that stressed by the structure, which
may be defined conservatively as that bounded by a 45° angle from the foundation area and depth. The
area to be bulk filled via boreholes (only a part of the borehole plan is shown in the drawing) is bounded
by a peripheral dam installed via closely spaced boreholes

Site Investigations for Subsidence Areas
The objectives of a site investigation in a mining area are likely to be one or more of
the following:
(cid:1) detection of old mine shafts including bell pits;
(cid:1) detection of old underground workings, their depth, extent, method of working and
degree of extraction;
(cid:1) location of zones of faulting along which subsidence due to collapse of old work-
ings could be expected to be concentrated.
10.14.1
Detection of Old Mine Workings
Old Mine Shafts
In considering old mine shafts as a target for a site investigation, account should be
taken of the possible variations, both in original construction and later history, that
may be present. The principal variable factors are:
(cid:1) type of shaft: unlined or brick lined;
(cid:1) later history: either unfilled, open and covered with a raft (often only of wood)
at ground surface, or completely or partially infilled and possibly rafted over at
depth;
(cid:1) nature of filling: material from original excavation or mine waste mixed with debris
from mine buildings, etc.;
(cid:1) water: air above water table or water below water table.
Thus the target for the site investigation can vary from an unlined bell-pit of 1 to
2 m in diameter and up to about 13 m deep and not backfilled, to an open brick-lined
shaft 2 m diameter, 30 m deep, partly air filled and partly water filled, rafted over with
wood 2 m below existing ground level and covered with made ground.
Old Workings
Old workings are also quite variable, depending on:
(cid:1) thickness of the seam,
(cid:1) percentage of coal extracted in room and pillar or pillar and stall workings,
(cid:1) state of preservation or collapse of old workings,
(cid:1) level of the water table.
Thus, the target may vary from either a water or air filled cavity of 1 to 2 m height,
to a zone of collapsed strata several times that height.
344 CHAPTER 10 · Withdrawal of Support by Underground Excavations
Fault Zones
The importance of faults as ‘safety valves’, absorbing strains in an area, has been pointed
out already. It is recommended to avoid building on ground 15 m either side of known
surface positions of faults. Mine records are usually the best source of information on faults.
10.14.2
Investigation Techniques
Drilling
In many cases it is necessary to penetrate the ground to seek details of working or
seam depths, cavities, pillar dimensions and extraction ratios, and to examine the
ground overlying workings for migrant voids, bedding plane separation and general frag-
mentation. A considerable number of drilled boreholes may be required but these may
be provided at reasonable cost (about one quarter of that of core-drilling) and with some
speed (about 80 to 130 m of drilling per day as compared to 10 to 13 m per day) by probe
or open-hole drilling. The use of compressed air rather than water for circulation has
the advantage of greater sensitivity in the detection of broken ground and workings, and
assures the recognition of the presence of groundwater. The borehole may be advanced
by rotary methods. More often the use of the tri-cone roller bit is to be preferred because
the larger size of the cuttings produced helps ascertain the detailed stratigraphy.
Trial Pits, Trenches and Inspection Shafts
Trial pits and trenches are invaluable for examining very shallow mine workings or
determining boundaries of infilled opencast workings (quarries from which coal has
been taken). If documentary evidence or preliminary boreholes reveal that mine work-
ings are open and reasonably dry they may be examined directly by sinking a shaft to
seam level. Such an examination may provide more reliable information than the
equivalent value of boring as the condition of the rock can best be ascertained by ex-
amination from a shaft, in which if appropriate, in situ tests may be conducted.
Geophysics
Geophysical techniques are, in principle, a powerful tool for locating old underground
workings (extensive descriptions of all common geophysical techniques can be found
in McDowell et al. 2002). However, there are three important difficulties:
1. The data obtained in a geophysical survey are virtually always ambiguous and there-
fore the results depend very much on the quality of their interpretation. The inter-
preter has to be experienced in site investigations for old mine workings as well as
being an experienced geophysicist. A non-geophysicist is likely to commission an
inappropriate geophysical survey that delivers disappointing results. The geophysi-
cist can make the same mistake if he or she knows nothing of mining.
10.14 · Site Investigations for Subsidence Areas 345
2. The second problem is that geophysics virtually never comes to a result that can be
guaranteed to be correct. Other methods such as drilling and trenching have to be
used as control on the geophysical results.
3. A third problem is that geophysical surveys can be expensive. This is caused by the
relatively long time expensive labour is required for both the survey and the inter-
pretation of its results. Many of the latter problems have been greatly reduced since
computers became available. This has opened options as three-dimensional seismics
with shear and compressive waves, and three-dimensional resistivity surveys for en-
gineering purposes. The latter may be very useful to obtain indications where and
at what depth old mine working may be present.
In all these cases there must be a measurable contrast in the physical property of
the features sought for them to be “seen” by geophysics. Shafts backfilled with the same
material as the surrounding ground may be “invisible” and seen possibly only by their
lining (Hack 2000).
Detection of Old Mine Shafts
In those cases where documentary evidence from the location of an old mine shaft is
uncertain and no surface features indicate its presence, the location of the shaft may
be attempted by magnetometry. The method can only be used in areas where the mag-
netic field is not disturbed by anomalies due to buried services, buildings, deep fill or
live power cables, which would mask the small anomalies likely to result from the
presence of a mine shaft. Following the location of a promising magnetic anomaly
it is necessary to excavate this in order to confirm that it is caused by a shaft. If an
investigation is required to prove the absence of a shaft from a site it is unwise to
assume that the lack of distinctive magnetic anomalies conclusively indicates the ab-
sence of the shaft. Probe drilling may be used to assess the condition of the shaft
infilling, but often the necessity for introducing casing to support the hole in loose
infilling so restricts the rate of drilling that probe drilling holds few advantages.
Accordingly, standard drilling methods are generally more appropriate so as to con-
duct standard penetration tests and take samples. Samples may later be chemically
analysed for soluble sulphate content if grouting the shaft is considered a suitable
means of stabilization. It must be emphasized that drilling into a marginally stable
shaft could initiate its collapse. Consequently, the equipment and personnel should
be supported on a drilling platform that should not rest on the shaft infilling. Simi-
larly, the potential risks arising from the possible emission of inflammable or poi-
sonous gases should be appreciated. Down-the-borehole camera and television
techniques may be used to provide visual confirmation of bedding plane separation
and fissuring above seam level as well as conditions in the seam itself, although defi-
nition may be poor below ground-water level and the range of visibility is limited
in old workings because of the difficulties of illumination. Down the hole acoustic
methods (echo sounders), continuously recording seismic methods and ultra-sensi-
tive methane detecting devices (for locating mine shafts) can all be used to assist de-
tection.
346 CHAPTER 10 · Withdrawal of Support by Underground Excavations
Design of Investigations
The initial aim of the investigation should be to establish the base site geology and
the number of boreholes required to do this will depend on the complexity of the situ-
ation. On undermined sites, however, they may well be more frequent than elsewhere
because of the higher degree of precision of investigation required. Similarly, the di-
ameter of rock cores may need to be greater than usual in order to ensure maximum
recovery of ground broken by mining. The selection of techniques to be employed,
and the probable depths, number and distinction of boreholes, should always be tai-
lored to the site. No two investigations need be the same.
The selection of techniques to investigate mine workings will depend on the depth
of working and the nature of the problem. In the case of room and pillar workings
rotary probe boreholes are most often a satisfactory method unless entry from a shaft
is feasible or the workings are shallow enough to be revealed by trenching. Probe bore-
holes are seldom of value in assessing the disturbed nature of ground broken by total
extraction mining and this work is best done by coring, possibly with associated per-
meability testing. The initial cored boreholes should penetrate at least 14 m into bed-
rock or into the seams, which, if worked, might affect the stability of the site. In the
case of room and pillar extraction the general principle that migrant voids are un-
likely to rise to a height above roof level greater than 6 times the height of the work-
ings suggest a maximum depth to which investigation need be taken. The number of
boreholes depends upon the complexity of the problem. In some cases, the standard
investigation may prove the depth of the seam and the method of working, and this
may be sufficient to provide a reasonable assessment of the situation, however it is
prudent to sink a number of probe boreholes to verify continuity of the condition of
the workings. Attempting to establish the absence of workings in a seam by boring
requires more boreholes than investigating the geometry of known workings, for the
more boreholes sunk that find the seam solid, the less the probability of workings. The
adoption of a grid system has obvious advantages for case of setting out and later draw-
ing of sections etc., but to avoid the remote chance (which has occasionally been real-
ized) of coincidence between the borehole grid and pillar distribution, it is wise to
avoid locating grid axes along dip and strike of the seam, and to introduce an element
of irregularity in the borehole lay-out.
Subsidence over Natural Solution Cavities
Geological units containing materials such as limestone, dolomite, and gypsum may
have natural solution cavities. The cavities originated due to groundwater flow that
dissolved the material, generally starting along a discontinuity and gradually form-
ing a cavity. Natural cavities grow with time and the material in the cavity may be
weakened by weathering, and creep. This causes most natural cavities to collapse af-
ter some time. The influence of natural cavities on civil engineering is similar to the
results of old mine workings as discussed before. Engineering measures to be taken
are similar to those taken for old mine workings. Investigations to locate the cavities
are difficult. Sometimes geophysical methods may work, however, generally, the re-
sults are not reliable enough, and hence cavities may remain undiscovered. The only
10.15 · Further Reading 347
truly reliable method to find the cavities is to drill holes to the required depth on a
grid pattern suitable for the engineering application.

Static Loading of the Ground
11.1
Introduction
The foundation of a structure is that part which transmits the load of the structure to
the ground and static loading implies a pressure from that foundation that does not
change with time. However, the pressure applied by most structures will vary to some
degree depending on the use of the structure. For example, foundation pressures given
by ordinary dwelling and office buildings will vary as the users move in and out of the
building. Such changes are not considered significant except where the structure is
built merely as a container, such as a silo for grain or a storage tank for fluids. The
sideways pressure of wind may be significant for tall structures and bridges, increas-
ing pressure on one side of a foundation and decreasing pressure on the other. In the
case of a piled foundation some piles may receive extra compressive loads while oth-
ers could at times be in tension.
If a load is placed upon the ground then the ground will deform under the stress
imposed by that load. This will result in settlement of the engineering structure that
imposed the extra load. If the load is too great to be supported by the ground then the
ground may fail in shear and the construction collapse (Fig. 11.1). There is a limit to
the load ground can carry and this is related to the mechanical properties of the ground
and to the size and shape of the engineering structure. Foundation loads imposed by
structures may be of the following orders of magnitude:

tion in shear

(cid:1) Office and residential properties ~10 N/m2 per storey
(cid:1) Compacted embankments ~20 kN/m2 per m3 of embankment
(cid:1) Mass concrete (as in a dam) ~25 kN/m2 per m3 of structure
11.1.1
Types of Foundation
Civil engineering structures that impose load on the ground can be grouped into two
types; mass structures and framed structures.
Mass structures made of soil, rock or mass concrete include such constructions as
embankments, dams, mining waste tips and breakwaters. These are in direct contact
with the ground and the magnitude and distribution of stress imposed upon the
ground is related to the size and shape of the constructed mass, and the density of the
material from which it is composed.
Framed constructions are buildings containing hollow spaces for dwellings, stor-
age or industrial use. The weight of the upper parts of the structure is transmitted to
the ground via the load bearing members of the structure. These load bearing mem-
bers are composed of steel, concrete, bricks and wood, whose strength is generally
much greater than that of the ground immediately beneath them. Contact between
these load bearing elements and the ground is made via a foundation, which gener-
ally distributes the load of the structure so that the stresses on the ground are not
excessive. There are four main types of foundation (Fig. 11.2).
Strip Footings
In an ordinary house or modest size building, external and internal walls carry the
building load. The foundation under the wall is usually a long strip of either mass or
reinforced concrete, which is somewhat wider than the wall it supports. It is very much
longer than it is wide. Foundations are usually placed at some depth, normally greater
than a metre below surface, to avoid swelling or shrinking associated with the ground
freezing or drying.
Fig. 11.2. Common types of foundation
11.1 · Introduction 351
Pad Footings
Larger buildings may be built around a framework of load bearing columns connected
together by horizontal beams. Foundations at the foot of these columns are square or
rectangular ‘pads’ of either reinforced or massive concrete. The pads are designed so
as to distribute the load from the column to the base of the pad without overstressing
the ground on which the pad rests.
Raft Foundations
If the foundation loads are high and the foundation ground weak, the area of pad or
strip footings required to give a bearable foundation stress may be so great that the
footings coalesce to form a single plate, extending under the whole area of the struc-
ture; i.e. a raft. The practicalities of foundation construction are such that if the com-
bined area of pad and strip footings exceeds about one third of the plan area of the
building, then it may be easier and more economic to construct a raft foundation. Raft
foundations are almost always of reinforced concrete, perhaps stiffened by cross beams.
Piled Foundations
Piles are essentially columns of reinforced concrete, steel or timber, usually between
about 0.3 and 1.5 m diameter which are inserted into the ground by a variety of meth-
ods and whose resistance to the load they carry is provided by friction on the sides of
the column and reaction with the ground at their base. There are many different types
of pile but they are mostly either ‘driven’ or ‘cast-in situ’.
Driven piles may be square or round in cross-section and are generally from 0.3 to
0.5 m diameter. They are mostly made of reinforced concrete, but may sometimes be
of timber or steel. Steel piles are often constructed of H or I section steel beams. These
piles are driven into the ground using mechanical hammers until they encounter a
strong layer that they cannot penetrate and/or until sufficient side friction is built
up to prevent further penetration. Often piles are driven until a limit is reached de-
fined by the number of blows required for a given increment of penetration. Driven
piles displace and compact the ground into which they are driven. If a foundation is
composed of many closely spaced equal length piles and piling begins on the founda-
tion periphery, it is not uncommon for the piles at the centre of the foundation to en-
counter difficult driving conditions because they are driven into ground already com-
pacted by the earlier piles.
Cast in situ piles are formed in place. A hole is first bored down to a bearing stra-
tum and the sides of the borehole supported by casing. A cage of reinforcing steel is
placed in the hole and concrete poured into the hole through a pipe going down to
the bottom of the hole. As the hole becomes filled with fluid concrete both injection
pipe and casing are pulled to the surface, leaving a reinforced concrete column in the
ground. The holes are made by percussion or auger drilling machines; diameters range
from about 0.4 to 1.5 m.
‘Shell’ piles combine driving and casting-in-place. A tube with a toe cap is driven
into the ground using a hammer inside the tube and the tube is then filled with con-
crete.
352 CHAPTER 11 · Static Loading of the Ground
The carrying capacity of both driven and cast in place piles is built up of ‘end-bear-
ing’ capacity (at the toe of the pile) and ‘skin friction’ (on the sides of the pile). The
proportion of pile load carried in end-bearing and in skin-friction varies greatly, de-
pending on ground conditions and the type of pile.
Other Foundation Types
The types of foundation discussed above are those most commonly used; others exist
which are essentially variations of the above e.g. basements, caissons, and stone col-
umns.
11.1.2
Distribution of Stress under a Foundation
The behaviour of the ground under a foundation depends on the geotechnical prop-
erties of the ground stressed and on the magnitude of stresses imposed. The volume
of ground stressed depends upon the size and shape of the foundation; the larger the
foundation and the load it carries, the greater the volume of ground that is stressed.
The stress imposed on the ground due to foundation loading diminishes with depth
below the foundation. Mathematical analysis, based on the theories of Boussinesq, has
shown that the stresses due to building loads fall within a ‘bulb of stress’ beneath a
foundation. Bulb of stress diagrams have been constructed for various shapes of foun-
dation and for both vertical and shear stresses. Figure 11.3 shows the additional ver-
tical stress passed to the ground by a foundation, expressed as a proportion of the foun-
dation pressure. Significant additional stress extends to a depth of about 1½ the di-
ameter (or width) of the foundation. This gives some help in deciding how deep in-
vestigation boreholes should be taken below surface.
Clearly the aim of an investigation should be to sample all the materials that are
likely to be stressed by the foundation load. At least one borehole should do this un-
less there is satisfactory information from some other source to show that it is not
necessary. If, as is often the case, the materials under the foundation become stronger
with depth then subsequent boreholes need only sample the shallow, more highly
stressed and probably weaker materials.
The bulb of stress diagram shows that the foundation load also stresses ground lying
outside the plan area of the foundation. There is thus some reason to locate investiga-
tion boreholes outside the foundation area of a proposed structure. In planning the
locations of investigation boreholes it is always better to think of investigating the bulb
of stress rather than the ground immediately under the foundation area.
Stress induced by foundation loading is contained within a bulb of stress whatever
the shape or size of the foundation, whether pad footings, strip footings, rafts or piles.
However, if the total foundation is composed of a number of foundation elements then
the bulbs of stress for each element coalesce to give a large bulb of stress for the total
foundation. Thus a single footing loads the ground to a small depth below it and a
group of footings, taken together, load the ground to a depth commensurate with the
total foundation area loaded by all the footings. It is particularly important to recognise
this if the ground is divided into strong and weak layers. Thus (Fig. 11.4) footings could

load a strong layer underlain by a weak layer. Each individual footing would be ad-
equately supported by the strong material but the stresses caused by the total founda-
tion could bring the underlying weak material to failure.
As it is necessary for the engineering geologist to appreciate how the foundations
are analysed, an introduction to common practice is appropriate.
11.2
Bearing Capacity in Soils
There is a maximum load that can be applied to clays, silts, sands, gravels and mix-
tures of these, beyond which the ground will fail; this is the “ultimate” condition; some-
thing less than that will be the “safe” condition. However, safe loads may still generate
a settlement that is excessive, so the safe load may have to be reduced yet further to an
“allowable” condition.
354 CHAPTER 11 · Static Loading of the Ground
11.2.1
Ultimate Bearing Capacity
This is the maximum foundation pressure which the ground will sustain without fail-
ure. Equations to calculate ultimate bearing capacity were formulated by Karl Terzaghi.
For the strip footing the equation is:
(11.1)
where c=cohesion of the underlying soil (Nm–2); B=width of foundation (m);
D=depth of footing below surface (m); N c, N
q
and Nγ are bearing capacity factors
whose value depends on the angle of shearing resistance of the underlying soil (di-
mensionless); Q =ultimate bearing capacity (Nm–2) and γ=unit weight of the soil
f
beneath the foundation (Nm–3).
The factors N c, N
q
and Nγ are given numerically in Table 11.1. Equation 11.1 holds
for strip footings only and may be adjusted for rectangular and circular footings by
modifying the values of the bearing capacity factors (Table 11.1). The equation ap-
plies to cases where the groundwater table level lies deep below the foundation.
The equation shows that ultimate bearing capacity depends not only on the
geotechnical properties of the ground but also on the shape of the foundation. Thus
strictly speaking it is not possible, as is so often done, to talk about the ‘bearing capac-
ity of the ground’ for bearing capacity relates to both foundation shape and the
geotechnical properties of the ground.
The ultimate bearing capacity formula, given above, deals with the possibilities of
failure in materials at the top of the bulb of stress. Because this is the zone of most
intense stress and is situated within the uppermost and probably weakest part of the
ground, it is reasonable to do this. However, in shallow foundations, the near surface
soils may have varying properties due to weathering and water table fluctuations, and
can be stronger than ground beneath. It must also not be forgotten that weaker soils
could lie below those loaded by the single foundation element, and be stressed within
the bulb of stress of the whole foundation. Consequently it is sensible to begin any
analysis leading to the determination of ultimate bearing capacity by first comparing
the shear strengths of the soils with the shear stresses from foundation loading, using
an appropriate shear stress distribution diagram; e.g. with depth and plotted against
the geological profile. Such an approach is prudent in the case of a foundation com-
posed of multiple foundation elements and the only approach to establish the bear-
ing capacity of the ground under a mass foundation.
The discussion above relates primarily to cohesive soils. In non-cohesive soils the
Terzaghi bearing capacity equation is modified to:
(11.2)
Now N
q
and Nγ depend upon the angle of shearing resistance (φ) of the granular
soil. The value of φ is often determined by field measurements. Because the blow count
(N-value) from the standard penetration test is related to φ values it is not surprising
that over the years graphs relating bearing capacity to foundation size and N-values
11.2 · Bearing Capacity in Soils 355
Table 11.1. Bearing capacity
factors modified for rectangu-
lar and circular footings
have been developed, and are extensively used in many countries for standard design
of foundations on sands and fine gravels. In general, allowable bearing pressure in-
creases as the N-value and foundation width increase. However, the N-value from the
field test has to be corrected to N' with regard to effective overburden pressure at the
test depth. Further, the allowable bearing pressure may be modified depending on the
position of the water table.
356 CHAPTER 11 · Static Loading of the Ground
11.2.2
Safe Bearing Capacity and Allowable Pressures
To determine ultimate bearing capacity there must be adequate data on ground proper-
ties and trust in the appropriateness of the calculation theory. Since neither are com-
monly to be found the calculated ultimate bearing capacity is divided by a factor of safety
to give the Safe Bearing Capacity. This factor of safety is commonly between 3 and 5, and
is chosen on the difficulty of the ground conditions and the importance of the structure.
Having made the necessary calculations and determined the safe bearing capacity
of the ground with regard to the proposed foundation it may be concluded that the
ground strength is adequate relative to the foundation pressure. However, while this
safe bearing pressure will not stress the ground to the point of failure it will cause the
ground to deform and consolidate. This deformation of the ground will produce settle-
ment of the structure. The settlement of some structures may be allowed only within
certain limits. Since settlement depends partly upon the pressure put on the ground it
may be necessary to reduce the safe bearing pressure to an Allowable Bearing Pres-
sure; this equates to the foundation pressure which will produce acceptable settlement.
If settlement of a structure is uniform there is usually little cause to be concerned
about possible damage to the structure. However, if settlement is not uniform, that is,
it is ‘differential’ between parts of the structure, then the structure may deform be-
yond its limits of tolerance and be damaged. Possible causes of differential settlement
are unequal loading within the structure, building parts of the structure at different
times and variations in ground conditions under the structure. The first two causes
can be anticipated; the last may stem from unforeseen ground conditions and is by
far the most important cause of foundation problems. Examples of geological condi-
tions that could cause differential settlement could be lenses of peat in alluvial soils
and variations in thickness of compressible soil over a deepening rockhead. If the site
investigation has detected unfavourable geological conditions that might give rise to
differential settlement then the foundation design must be modified to overcome this
problem. Thus, in the example above, piles down to relatively incompressible rock that
could take the structure load with little deformation might be preferred.
If the ground is found to be overstressed at depth then an alternative foundation
design may be sought. In the case of embankments, perhaps built over a long period
of time (a number of years), advantage may be taken of early non-critical loadings to
consolidate the weak soil and improve its strength sufficiently to resist the shear
stresses developed when the embankment is higher.
11.2.3
Bearing Capacities on Boulder Bearing Soils
The comments on bearing capacity and settlement of soils given above apply to those
soils which can be sampled and tested, either in the laboratory or in the field. How-
ever, there are soils, such as moraines, and fluvio-glacial deposits, which contain par-
ticles larger than any borehole diameter yet smaller than a foundation. Such materi-
als can neither be sampled nor tested in the laboratory and even if tested by large scale
field methods it is difficult to be sure that test results are representative. How these
mixtures of boulders and matrix behave will largely depend upon the proportions of
11.3 · Settlement on Soils 357
their components. If the boulders are surrounded by matrix, as in some ‘boulder clays’,
mass behaviour will approximate to that of the matrix. However, if the boulders con-
stitute the greater part of the deposit or are in contact, then the character of the ma-
trix will have less influence. The proportions of coarse particles to finer matrix recov-
ered in boreholes may give a clue to mass properties and this is best achieved by in-
spection of the material in situ with either a trial pit or natural exposure.
11.3
Settlement on Soils
Settlement is of two types, first ‘immediate settlement’, which results from the elastic
deformation of the ground (using the word elastic in a very general sense) and then
‘consolidation settlement’ which is the result of the long-term compaction or consoli-
dation of the ground under the load imposed by the structure. Once construction com-
mences, both types of settlement begin to take place simultaneously. However it is
convenient in many cases, especially with clay rich soils, to think of immediate settle-
ment taking place during construction and consolidation settlement continuing after
completion of construction.
11.3.1
Immediate (Short-Term) Settlement
This depends upon the ‘elastic’ properties of the fabric formed by particles and pore
water between particles whereas consolidation depends on the rearrangement of the
particles made possible by a reduction in pore pressure.
Terzaghi and Peck (1948) produced one of the earliest relationships between the settle-
ment of a 1 ft2 (=0.3 m×0.3 m) square plate and the settlement of a square foundation
on sand:
(11.3)
where s=plate settlement; B=width of foundation and S=settlement of foundation.
The layer of soil tested by the plate bearing test must be uniform for a depth of at
least 4 B under the foundation. On clayey soils they suggested immediate settlement
(S) may be calculated using the formula:
i
(11.4)
where S =immediate settlement (m); B=width of foundation (m); v=Poisson’s ra-
i
tio (assumed to be 0.5 for clay; dimensionless); E=the modulus of elasticity for the
clay (N m–2); I =an influence factor depending on the shape of the foundation, intro-
p
358 CHAPTER 11 · Static Loading of the Ground
duced because the volume of the stress bulb changes with the shape of the foundation
(dimensionless) and q=net foundation pressure (N m–2).
E is determined from the stress/strain curve produced by triaxial tests on the clay
and is commonly a secant modulus to a stress level approximately equal to that pro-
duced by the foundation loading. This formula may be modified to allow for flexible
and rigid foundations. Flexible foundations are those of earth structures, such as em-
bankments; rigid foundations are of reinforced concrete, so that settlement is uniform
over the whole foundation area.
11.3.2
Consolidation (Long-Term) Settlement
Consolidation depends on the water content of the soil and its permeability. Before
soil grains can be brought into close contact so that pore spaces become smaller, pore
contents (water and/or air) must be driven out of the pore spaces. How fast they can
move out depends upon the permeability of the soil. Because the sands and gravels
have mostly high permeability, almost all consolidation settlement in them is com-
plete by the end of construction. In clayey and silty soils many years may pass before
consolidation settlement is complete.
Consolidation may be predicted using the results of the oedometer test. The ground
under a structure is divided up into layers considered to have equal consolidation
characteristics, and the average additional stress imposed on each layer is calculated.
Settlement of each layer may then be calculated from the formula:
S =m σH (11.5)
c v z
where m =coefficient of volume compressibility for the layer (m2N–1); H=thickness
v
of the layer (m); σ=average effective vertical stress imposed on the layer as a result
z
of the foundation loading (N m–2) and S =consolidation settlement (m).
c
The total settlement (S) at any time t may be expressed by the formula:
t
S =S +US (11.6)
t i c
where U is the degree of consolidation (given as a percentage) at time t, which for any
degree of consolidation may be determined using the relationship:
(11.7)
where T=a time factor dependant on drainage characteristics (dimensionless), d=a
thickness relating to the thickness (H) of the layer and its drainage characteristics
(length) and C =coefficient of consolidation of the soil in the layer determined from
v
the oedometer test within the range of pressure increase imposed by the foundation
(area/unit time).
11.4 · Bearing Capacity on Rock Masses 359
Fig. 11.5. The influence of
drainage conditions on the rate
of consolidation
The value of d is determined by considering whether the consolidating layer will
drain in one direction (upwards or downwards) or in two directions (upwards and
downwards). If the layer has permeable sand above and below, d=H/2; if a perme-
able layer exists either above or below the sand layer then d=H. T may be read from
graphs relating U (as a percentage) to T for various drainage conditions (Fig. 11.5).
The presence of permeable, usually silty, layers within clays will govern the time to
reach 50% consolidation. Clearly considerable attention should be given to establish-
ing the presence of such layers when examining cored samples and, indeed, to the
design of the site investigation to recover such samples, and every engineering geolo-
gist should refer here to the work of Rowe (1972). The aid of such layers in allowing
drainage of clays is demonstrated by the installation of filter layers in embankments
constructed from clays: those with such layers installed consolidate more rapidly than
those which do not have such aids to drainage. However, in nature, sand and silt
may occur in lenses totally surrounded by clay and would thus not act as drains.
Attention must be given to establishing the lateral continuity of sand layers found in
boreholes.
In design practice, it is common to consider the time taken to achieve 50% consoli-
dation and 90% consolidation. While this depends on soil characteristics it is not un-
common that in normally consolidated clay 50% consolidation may take about 2 to
5 years to achieve and 90% consolidation more than 10 years to achieve.
11.4
Bearing Capacity on Rock Masses
A large number of major civil engineering works are constructed on rock. The reac-
tion of rock to static loading is different from the reaction of soil because of the gen-
erally much greater strength of rock as a material, the presence of discontinuities in
the rock mass and the type of anisotropy of the rock mass.
360 CHAPTER 11 · Static Loading of the Ground
One of the first questions to be asked in considering the reaction of a rock mass to
static loading is “Is it all rock?”; all rocks, when weathered, reach a stage in their weath-
ering when their geotechnical properties are those of soils. The engineering geologist
must be aware that within a rock mass there may be bands and zones that have the
properties of engineering soils; these need not all be weathered zones. Some so-called
‘shales’ are, in terms of their properties, over-consolidated clays, with the added com-
plexity of marked discontinuities. It is thus particularly important to check on the
engineering properties of argillaceous rocks in layered sedimentary sequences, such
as alternating limestones and shales or sandstones and shales.
Establishing the allowable bearing pressure to be used for a particular project may
begin by considering the ultimate bearing capacity (Q) of a rock mass. Assuming that
f
the discontinuities in the mass have no influence on bearing capacity, Q is approximately
f
four times the uniaxial undrained compressive strength of the rock material. Thus,
Q ≈4U (11.8a)
f c
and safe bearing capacity (Q ) is equal to U/x, where x is the factor of safety; a value
s c
of x=3.0 has been suggested for weak gypsum-cement type rock though in most cases
values less than that are adequate (Serrano and Olalla 1996). If, however, the mass is
jointed and the joints are open, so that joint bounded columns of rock are not restrained
by adjacent rock then clearly the ultimate bearing capacity of the mass under a par-
ticular foundation is equal to the compressive strength of the rock columns. Thus,
Q ≈4 U and Q ≈U /3 (11.8b)
f m s m
where U is the uniaxial undrained compressive strength of a column through the rock
m
mass. U may not equal U because the column may contain frequent and unfavourably
m c
orientated internal discontinuities in it, so that U <U.
m c
If, for example, it is assumed that a rock material is weak with an unconfined com-
pressive strength of 5 MPa and that U /U is 0.5, then Q would be about 10 MPa and
m c f
Q about 0.8 MPa.
s
The influence of discontinuities on bearing capacity has been studied by tests on
model rock masses. Goodman (1980) concluded that the bearing capacity of a homo-
geneous, discontinuous rock mass under a footing could not be less that the compres-
sive strength of that rock mass and proposed the formula:
Q f=U cm(Nφ+1) (11.9)
where Nφ=tan(45+φ/2), U cm=unconfined compressive strength of the rock mass and
φ=angle of shearing resistance of the rock mass.
Berkhout (1985) examined the behaviour of modelled rock masses with various
degrees of joint density. The rock masses were modelled from variously dimensioned
cubes of artificial rock and loaded by model foundations to measure deformation and
failure. Joint apertures were equal. As might be expected, clear relationships emerged
between bearing capacity and joint density and between deformation modulus and
joint density. Both decreased as joint density (expressed as joint surface area per unit
volume) increased (Fig. 11.6).
11.4 · Bearing Capacity on Rock Masses 361
The approaches examined above consider a single foundation element while most
structure foundations are made up of many elements of different sizes covering a sig-
nificant area. The results of the model studies and the Goodman equation clearly re-
veal the factors which are of importance in establishing the bearing capacity of rock
masses; whether or not these factors can be measured in the course of site investiga-
tion is another matter.
A ground investigation might aim to divide the rock mass into one of two classes;
those in which the properties of the rock mass approximately equal those of the rock
material, and those in which they do not.
The classification of the mass can be achieved by comparing measurable mass and
material properties, the former being influenced by the frequency, aperture, orienta-
tion and persistence of discontinuities and the latter by weathering. Such properties
might be: E for the mass versus E for the material, or mass permeability (k )
static static mass
versus material permeability (k ), or compression wave velocity V (mass) ver-
material p
sus V (material), or any other property of both mass and material which would be
p
significantly changed by the presence, intensity and condition of discontinuities and
weathering.
The closer the ratio (mass properties/material properties) approaches unity the
nearer do mass properties approach those of the material.
The factors that determine the bearing capacity of a rock mass have been intro-
duced into rock mass classification systems (Bieniawski 1989) and the Hoek-Brown
empirical rock failure criterion (Hoek 1983). Serafim and Pereira (1983) have indi-
cated correlations between RMR (Rock Mass Rating) and mass cohesion, friction and

modulus, while Laubscher (1984), utilising a rock mass rating system arrives at a ba-
sic strength for a rock mass. It would seem clear that use of a rock mass rating system
is a way forward for establishing a method of estimating rock mass bearing capacity,
but much information has to be assembled in a database to allow development of a
reliable system; this is being done via in situ monitoring of ground movement under
foundation loads and numerical modelling of the same ground. The parameter for
strength and stiffness which a model requires so as to predict the movements mea-
sured are those that can be attributed to a rockmass rating system for the ground
(Marinos and Hoek 2000). Enough experience already exists to recommend guideline
bearing capacities for various rock types or formations but the data required to pro-
vide a non-empirical prediction is still developing.

Foundation Settlement on Rock
It is commonly assumed that settlement of structures on rock foundations is almost
always immediate or at least very rapid and may be calculated using the formula ap-
propriate for the settlement of a rigid circular plate, namely:
(11.10)
where S=settlement (m), Q=foundation load (N), r=radius of circular foundation
(m), E =(secant) modulus of deformation (Nm–2), and v=Poisson’s ratio.
s
The modulus of deformation, may be obtained by plate bearing tests on ‘samples’
of the rock mass. Which modulus is chosen as representative of mass behaviour de-
pends on the way the mass behaves, but a secant modulus to either a maximum de-
sign foundation stress, or higher, may be appropriate. A useful but approximate for-
mula for the settlement of a square foundation is:
(11.11)
where B=foundation width (m) and q=foundation pressure (Nm–2).
If no in situ tests are available to measure E, recourse may be considered to deter-
s
mine the deformation modulus from the Rock Mass Rating by the Geomechanics Clas-
sification (Bieniawski 1989). Bieniawski offers the correlation for RMR>50 of:
(11.12)
where E =in situ modulus of deformation in units of GPa and RMR=Rock Mass

Rating.
11.5 · Foundation Settlement on Rock 363
These very simple approaches are, of course, appropriate to only rather simple prob-
lems. In the case of major structures on heterogeneous rock masses recourse may be
had to finite element analysis to allow calculation of rock deformation. Here, the prob-
lem lies not only in the mathematics involved in such solutions but also in finding truly
appropriate mass property parameters to put into the equations.
One difficulty with rock masses is that anisotropy of the mass will deform the shape
of the bulb of stress under the foundation. Gaziev and Erlikhman (1971) have shown
by model testing that the bulb of stress will be deformed depending on the inclina-
tion of stratification (Fig. 11.7). Obviously such a stress distribution will have a pro-
found effect on deformation and perhaps also on bearing capacity.
If rock deforms unequally under a foundation then the problems of differential
settlement arise. Such problems are particularly significant in the case of concrete dams
for if the modulus of deformation of the rock formation is greatly different from that
of the dam concrete then the concrete may deform to the extent that it cracks or that
the watertight seals linking concrete monoliths are opened.
Another basic problem of concern in rock foundations is the problem of creep. Tests
have shown that any rock has an ‘instantaneous strength’, measured in the standard un-
confined compression test and a long-term strength, which may be assessed in a creep test.
The long-term strength may be perhaps but one quarter of the instantaneous strength.
Thus structures imposing a long-term load on a creep sensitive rock foundation could,
perhaps after many years, bring that rock to the point of failure. What seems to reduce
this potential problem to relatively slight proportions is the fact that most major struc-
tures are founded on the stronger rocks so that even their long-term strength is more than
adequate to sustain the foundation load. However, some consideration might have to be
given to potential creep problems if heavy structures are founded on obviously weak rock
which might be creep sensitive. Such rocks are the clayey rocks, highly porous and weakly
cemented rocks and rocks which might contain gypsum, anhydrite or salt.
Fig. 11.7. Changes in stress pattern following discontinuity structure (Gaziev and Erlikhman 1971)
364 CHAPTER 11 · Static Loading of the Ground
While creep phenomena might not lead to failure they might lead to settlement
that is somewhat greater than that calculated on the basis of elastic parameters.
Meigh (1976) has described how the settlement of a nuclear reactor founded on
Keuper Marl was calculated to be about 40 mm with an estimated total settlement of
about 60 mm. After application of 90% of the total load the settlement had already
exceeded 60 mm and was increasing under virtually constant load. Creep charac-
teristics of the rocks were investigated and taking these into account settlements
of about 115 mm could be anticipated. By the end of 1974, eleven years after con-
struction commenced, settlement had reached about 102 mm on one reactor and
120 mm on the other; time/settlement graphs indicated that settlement appeared
to be complete.

Preliminary Estimates by the Engineering Geologist
Every one of the calculations outlined so far requires the ground to be idealised in
some way so that a “typical” value for this or that parameter can be used. What should
the engineering geologist “do” to contribute relevant data? It helps to know the data
required, hence the introduction above, and the geology that will be relevant.
11.6.1
Estimates of Bearing Capacity
Over the years engineers have developed, as a consequence of experience, some gen-
eral knowledge of the likely bearing capacity of most ground masses. This knowledge
has been assembled and presented in codes of good practice in foundation engineer-
ing. The table presented in this text (Table 11.2) is that given in the 1975 edition of
Blake’s ‘Civil Engineer’s Reference Book’; it is not repeated in more modern editions of
that work. Once published, tables of this sort become too readily accepted by engi-
neers as short cuts for design purposes, which may lead subsequently to arbitration
in which even the authors of the tables could be held partly accountable.
The table gives ‘presumed bearing values’ for various types of soils and rocks. A
presumed bearing value is the net intensity of foundation loading considered appro-
priate to a particular type of ground for preliminary design purposes. The idea is that
the engineer, confronted with the need to begin designing a structure, might deter-
mine the nature of the ground from the study of a geological map, use the table to
assign bearing values and thus get some idea of the suitability of the site and the pos-
sible foundation type required for the structure and the ground investigation that
would be appropriate. This preliminary assessment might lead to selecting an alter-
native site, to changes in site layout design, to the recognition of certain requirements
in site investigation and so forth. Used this way the table can be extremely useful.
However, it must never ever be used as an alternative to undertaking either a site in-
vestigation, or a proper engineering design.
While the table may be considered rather old-fashioned, its consideration of foun-
dations on rock embodies certain fundamental principles, namely,
11.6 · Preliminary Estimates by the Engineering Geologist 365
i the stronger the rock material the greater the ‘presumed bearing value’,
ii the greater the number of discontinuities in the rock mass the lower the ‘presumed
bearing value’,
iii that whatever the character of the rock mass the ‘presumed bearing value’ will be
reduced by weathering and faulting.
Many structures founded on rock may not have the economic, industrial and so-
cial worth that merits the profound and detailed investigations given to major works.
For these structures, the office blocks, the minor buildings and the like, a philosophy
which may be followed is not to try to determine the true bearing capacity of the rock
mass by elaborate testing and calculation, but to ask the designer what bearing ca-
pacity is necessary for reasonable foundation design, and then to determine whether
or not the rock mass is adequate for that purpose. If this approach is undertaken then
the presumed bearing values given in the table are a good starting point for investiga-
tion. The investigation may be directed towards determining whether or not there are
Table 11.2. Approximate presumed bearing values for rock and soil masses
366 CHAPTER 11 · Static Loading of the Ground
geological factors, such as weathering, or geomorphological factors such as disturbance
of the ground by landsliding which make the presumed bearing value invalid.
11.6.2
Influence of Geological Factors on Foundation Performance
Variations in Mass Strength in Alternating Layers
It is not uncommon in bedded rocks to find a layer of strong foundation rock overly-
ing some softer or weaker material. While the upper layer may well be strong enough
to carry the foundation load the underlying layer may be overstressed and fail.
Kaderabek and Reynolds (1981) have described the problems of building on Miami
Limestone; a young deposit 100000 years old and forming a layer 3 to 14 m thick. Often
this layer occurs as a ‘mat’ or plate of rocky material resting on sand. The basic prob-
lem is whether or not the mat is able to carry a proposed building load.
The authors have recognised four possible modes of behaviour of the mat which
must be considered when attempting to assess its bearing capacity. These are: punch-
ing or diagonal failure of the mat (Fig. 11.8a); local crushing of the limestone under
the foundation; beam tension failure (Fig. 11.8b); and settlement of the mat into the
underlying soils.
The authors suggest that the first failure mode is most likely to occur if the ratio
H/B is small (H=mat thickness, B=foundation width). This might happen if foun-
dations are sunk deep into the limestone (as for basements) as the effective thickness
of the mat is thus reduced. To examine this possibility the authors suggest that a cy-
lindrical failure surface is assumed, the surface area of this cylinder equalling the pe-
rimeter of the footing times the thickness of the limestone below the foundation. The
ultimate resistance to shearing then equals the shear strength of the rock times the
surface area of the cylinder.
To overcome the second problem the authors suggest that the theoretical contact
pressure of the concrete foundation on rock be limited to no more than the uncon-
Fig. 11.8. Failure modes of
foundations on Miami lime-
stone (after Kaderabek and
Reynolds 1981)
11.6 · Preliminary Estimates by the Engineering Geologist 367
fined compressive strength of the rock material. The third type of failure may occur
when the H/B ratio is large and the flexural strength of the mat small. In such a case
the tensile strength of the rock is the dominating factor. To determine the settlement
of a structure on a limestone mat which has been established as unlikely to fail in any
of the three modes given above, the authors calculate the deformation of the mat us-
ing the elastic properties of the rock and thence calculate consolidation of the soils
below using conventional soil mechanics techniques.
The properties of the Miami Limestone are not uniform and the authors have de-
termined the shear strength of the rock mass (necessary to assess the possibility of
punching failure) by undertaking anchor pull-out tests.
Influence of Weathering
All materials wheather once they are exposed to the near surface environment. Un-
derground, chemical weathering takes place aided by percolating groundwater. Soils
are less likely to weather than rocks as they are in many cases already the products of
weathering. Changes can occur within them; e.g. in tropical climates the development
of lateritic soils is a consequence of weathering and is of importance in engineering
in such areas and the behaviour of “quick clays” is attributed to leaching (Kenney 1964).
The effects of weathering are much more obvious in rock. The susceptibility of a
rock to weathering depends upon its composition; in general the more clayey the rock
the greater its susceptibility. Thus shales could be considered to be more susceptible
than sandstones. If these two rock types are found in an interlayered rock mass and if
they have been subjected to exposure to weathering then the weathering in the shale
would be more severe than that of the sandstone. In dipping strata this can mean that
the shale would be weathered to a greater depth than the sandstone, so that weath-
ered shale could be found under almost fresh sandstone (Fig. 11.9a). This has an im-
portant effect on foundation bearing capacity. While weathering, differential or oth-
erwise, may be recognised as a potential problem it is very difficult to anticipate the
style and severity of weathering in a specific rock mass because this not only depends
on lithology but also on its geological history (unloading, glaciation, etc.).
In Europe and other parts of the world this is made particularly difficult because
of the changes in climate and weathering agencies which occurred during the Pleis-
tocene. Higginbottom and Fookes (1971) have described how, at the Pembroke Power
Station (Fig. 11.9b) softened shales and mudstones were reduced to the consistency
of a clay as a consequence of periglacial action, so that decomposed rock could be found
beneath fresher materials.
It is important to recognise that certain rock types have distinct styles of weather-
ing. Thus the coarser grained igneous rocks (such as granite, gabbro and dolerite) are
susceptible to spheroidal weathering. In this, weathering eats into the rock material,
beginning at the joints which conduct percolating water. The zone of weathered ma-
terial widens around the joints until rounded core stones of almost fresh rock lie in a
matrix of sandy residual soil. The boundary between the residual soil and the core
stones is often sharp; intervening weathering grades occupying but a few millimetres
of matrix, if they can be said to exist at all.
It may be very difficult to recognise this condition from borehole evidence
(Fig. 11.10). Thus two boreholes, A and B in the figure, may be, by chance, so situated
368 CHAPTER 11 · Static Loading of the Ground
Fig. 11.9. Consequences of dif-
ferential weathering in dipping
layered rocks; a the general
problem; b at Pembroke power
station (after Higginbottom
and Fookes 1971)
that borehole A shows mostly fresh rock and borehole B mostly residual soil. Unless
the results of these boreholes are interpreted in the light of background knowledge of
the likely weathering style, an interpretation of rock mass conditions could be erro-
neous. It is always a good idea, particularly if working in an area previously unknown
to the investigator, to examine natural outcrops, quarries, cuttings etc. to obtain an
impression of the style of weathering of the local rocks. In this way one is better able
to interpret mass weathering from the information given by a series of boreholes drilled
for the design of foundations.
Soluble rocks, the limestones, and the salt, gypsum and anhydrite bearing rocks,
present especial problems. The phenomenon of the solution weathering of limestone
is perhaps the most widely known. Areas of limestone in which extensive underground
drainage has evolved as a result of solution weathering and which display surface swal-
low holes, sinkholes, dolines, and the like may be described to be ‘karst’ (after the type
area in Yugoslavia). The solution process, by dissolving away the calcium carbonate
of which limestone is chiefly composed, leaves behind a mass of unweathered lime-
stone containing holes. If a limestone weathering product remains it is often red fer-
ruginous clay (terra rossa) but there is not a lot of it. Limestones, although full of so-

lution caverns, tend to form ridges through which rivers may flow in narrow steep sided
valleys. Such valleys are well suited topographically for dam construction but the en-
gineer has to accept the hazard of solution cavities.
If such a site is chosen for a dam the designer faces two major problems, first, that
the rock mass is weakened by the caverns within it so its bearing capacity is suspect
and, second, that leakage under the dam and through abutment rock could be through
karst. It is sometimes found that the problem is not the relatively simple one of cav-
erns in otherwise solid rock; in the geological history of the limestone mass caverns
may have collapsed, the debris become re-cemented, then further solution occurred
and so on. Sometimes caverns are partly filled with soil which may be the weathering
product of the limestone itself or have been washed into the caverns from some over-
lying formation. Boreholes sunk along a dam axis may reveal a nightmare melange of
such features. Many papers have been published describing such conditions. For ex-
ample, Moneymaker (1969) has described the conditions encountered in a number of
dams built in the USA; in the case of the Kentucky Dam, solution features extended
for some 70 m below the valley floor. In some cases the solution activity may be seen
to be concentrated along a particular band of limestone, this band being particularly
susceptible to solution as a result of texture, mineralogy, jointing or perhaps because
it is bounded by impermeable layers of shale. Solution activity revealed by karst need
not be of recent geological origin; Bless et al. (1980) have shown that the karst found
in Devonian Limestones in Belgium was of early Carboniferous age.
A major problem that faces all engineers dealing with any form of construction on
karstic limestone is whether or not the limestone solution is continuing or likely to be
370 CHAPTER 11 · Static Loading of the Ground
re-activated as a result of the construction work. In dams the danger is that water, slowly
seeping through the foundation rock under the hydraulic head of the reservoir, will
enlarge fissures and form cavities. This depends partly on water chemistry and lime-
stone mineralogy and it is prudent to measure solution parameters of carbonate rocks
to help assess these possibilities (James 1981). Existing limestone caverns may be filled
with grout and concrete to render the rock mass impermeable, but grout cannot pen-
etrate caverns filled with clay debris. This debris might, however, be slowly washed
out by percolating water from reservoir leakage.
If, on any site, bedrock is found under a layer of younger terrestrial sediment such
as glacial drift it follows that at some time in geological history the bedrock surface
was an exposed landscape and may display features associated with its erosion. Fea-
tures such as faults, dykes and so forth may be found eroded out to form deep gullies.
Rawlings (1971) has described glacial meltwater channels which were found in the
foundation rock of the Llyn Brianne Dam in Wales. In glaciated areas the bedrock may
contain major dislocated rock blocks and shear zones formed from the movement of
overlying ice. Knill (1968) has described the significance of such features in dam con-
struction. Bedrock outside the area of direct ice erosion may be severely disturbed by
‘periglacial’ features associated with permafrost conditions.
Discontinuities
All rock masses contain discontinuities and most rock masses have at least three sets
of discontinuities cutting them. Their significance to foundations is related to their
frequency of occurrence, orientation and openness. Orientation is important in that,
relative to the direction of the stresses imposed by the foundation and the shape of
the landscape on which the foundation is placed, sliding may occur along unfavourably
orientated discontinuities. Frequency is important in that the more frequent the
discontinuities the more opportunities there are for them to be open and to slide.
Not all loads imposed by foundations are vertical. In the case of dams the pressure
of the water in the reservoir is resisted by the mass of the dam, the connection of the
dam to the ground, and the mass strength of the ground (Fig. 11.11). During construc-
tion a dam imposes vertical load on its foundation but once the reservoir begins to
fill the water pressure on the dam adds a horizontal component to the foundation load.
The magnitude of this horizontal component depends on the type of dam. Gentle
sloped earth dams have a lesser component than steep sided concrete dams, for the
force of the water is at right angles to the water retaining component of a dam slope.
The ratio of dam mass vertical pressure to horizontal water pressure tends to become
smaller as the dam becomes thinner and steeper, reaching its ultimate in thin arch
dams, where the dam concrete transfers the water pressure to rock abutments.
If horizontal forces exist then there is always the possibility that the dam founda-
tion might slide along a low angled weak discontinuity, such as a shear zone, fault or
bedding plane, in the foundation rock (Fig. 11.12).
One obvious area of danger is the interface between the cast-concrete, or placed
earth/rock fill, and the rock foundation. For this reason foundation rock is always care-
fully cleaned before the foundation is placed and sometimes sprayed with gunite. In
concrete dams much attention is paid to a good concrete/rock bond and cored bore-
holes may be sunk through the interface to check this.

The reader should at this point recognise the similarity between the sliding dam
and the rock block sliding on a slope that forms the first page in many texts on slope
stability. The mechanism is the same; the difference is the origin of the forces and their
orientation relative to the horizontal. Answers to the problem are also similar. Frictional
forces may be increased by long cable anchors, as was done in the Les Cheurfas dam in
Algeria (Walters 1971) and water uplift pressures may be reduced by drainage wells sunk
into the rock mass and discharging into galleries. Grout curtains or concrete cut-offs,
and blanket grouting lengthen seepage paths and so reduce leakage and uplift pressures.
372 CHAPTER 11 · Static Loading of the Ground
Fig. 11.12. Potential planes for

According to Jaeger (1979) uplift pressures (Fig. 11.13) may be calculated using the
formula:
(11.13)
where F =uplift force (N), B=base area of dam (m2), H =height reservoir (m),
u r
H =height tailwater (m), γ =density of water (Nm–3), and j=a factor, not more than
t w
one, which is related to the percentage of the base area of the dam on which the uplift
forces act. It may be reduced to values of 0.8 or 0.9 using the judgement of the design
engineer.
11.6 · Preliminary Estimates by the Engineering Geologist 373
Fig. 11.13. Reduction of water uplift pressures on dams by drainage
In Fig. 11.13a uplift pressures are represented by the area of the shaded trapezium
below the dam. With drainage this area is reduced (Fig. 11.13b). Drainage holes are
sunk to a depth at least that of the height of the drainage gallery above the dam base.
Some engineers prefer large diameter holes or shafts to boreholes, for these are less
easily blocked. The water rises into the gallery and drains away. How much rises de-
pends upon rock mass permeability.
If the dam is so designed that the reservoir water thrust is almost totally resisted
by the rock foundation with little resistance given by the weight of the dam, as in arch
dams, then the direction and strength of discontinuities in the rock mass is of vital
importance in assessing rock mass resistance. For such projects extensive and detailed
geological mapping must be undertaken to determine orientation and location of
discontinuities and laboratory and field tests are required to determine their strength.
Having determined these factors then calculations must be undertaken to analyse
dam stability. These calculations are again based upon the sliding block concept. The
data required to allow calculation includes: (1) orientation of discontinuities, (2) ori-
entation of dam loads, (3) magnitude of dam loads, (4) shear strength parameters of
discontinuities and (5) estimates of water pressures on the dam and in discontinuities.
The investigation of the foundation conditions of the Monar Dam in Scotland pro-
vides a good example of this type of analysis; Henkel et al. (1964). The Monar dam is
a double curvature gravity dam (resembling an arch dam) on the river Farrar in Scot-
land. It is not a large dam, being 35 m high and 161 m long. The concrete of the arch is
divided into eleven blocks separated by construction joints which were sealed after
the concrete had cooled (Fig. 11.14). Construction took place between 1959 and 1963.
The dam is founded on metamorphic rocks which are psammitic granulites of Pre-
Cambrian age. The rocks have been folded in at least two periods of deformation and
are generally strong and little weathered but contain thin pelitic layers, pegmatites and
occasional quartz veins. The bulk properties of the rock mass are controlled by a sys-
tem of joints. These were examined in exposures and cores and were found to fall into
sets, shown in Fig. 11.14. The dyke was of heavily sheared, slickensided and weath-
ered lamprophyre, about 1.8 m thick and outcropped upstream of the dam, dipping
374 CHAPTER 11 · Static Loading of the Ground
Fig. 11.14. Monar dam (after Henkel et al. 1964)
under the dam to be about 18 m below the dam base in the river section. Joints were
tested for peak and residual strength and as a consequence of orientation and strength
it was considered that sliding of the dam might occur along the joint set dipping west-
ward at 31°. Accordingly the stability of six of the eleven component blocks was ex-
amined. In making the stability analysis it was assumed that resistance to movement
of the block was provided only by the foundation rock.
Three types of forces were involved in the stability calculation. These were:
i forces transferred to the dam foundation by the dam structure. These forces were
vertical and parallel to the dam axis;
ii forces due to the weight of the rock wedge forming the dam foundation;
iii water forces, consisting of thrust at the back of the foundation wedge and uplift on
the joint B at the base of the wedge.
These forces were resolved into components acting normal to and along the plane
of sliding. However, the joint A also provided some restraint to sliding and this was
taken into account. It was assumed that the orientation of the B joints was 31° dip to-
wards N284° and that the A joints were vertical, striking N285°, and that the angle of
friction of the B joints was 50° and that of the A joints 25°. The factors of safety of

each block were calculated assuming no drainage and drainage measures to reduce
water pressure (Table 11.3).
These results demonstrate the increase in safety achieved when water pressure is
reduced by installing drainage boreholes. Later in the analysis the effects of variation
in joint orientation were examined and it was found that, while the factor of safety
was in some cases reduced, it was never-the-less adequate. The technique used to
analyse the situation was essentially that used to analyse the stability of the sliding
block on a slope but was complicated by variations in force direction relative to geo-
logical structure. Performance of the dam after construction was monitored and it
behaved satisfactorily.
Other dams have been less fortunate. The 151 m high Canelles dam in Spain (Alvarez
and Sancho 1974), was founded on karstic limestone which gave a problem of leak-
age, solved by an extensive grouting programme. The limestones dipped upstream
(Fig. 11.15) and contained extensive vertical joints near parallel to the valley sides. It
was feared that these joints would lessen the resistance of the rock mass to the reser-
voir water pressures transmitted by the arch dam to the rock mass. Samples of joints
were cut out of tunnel walls and tested for shear strength.
Calculations confirmed these fears and accordingly a concrete buttress, held in place
by prestressed cable anchorages (Fig. 11.15), was proposed to provide additional re-
sistance to possible sliding on the vertical joints. However, possible problems with cable
corrosion and relaxation (as later experienced at Les Cheurfas dam) recommended
their replacement by tunnels, filled or lined with heavily reinforced concrete, which
cross the joints and act as shear pins to reinforce them.
11.7
Foundations on Slopes
Every slope has a stability that depends on the strengths of materials and disconti-
nuities in the slope, action of groundwater, slope angle and so forth. If a structure is
built at the top of the slope then the load imposed by that structure adds to the slope
weight and to the potential driving forces that can initiate failure. It is relatively easy
to assess the stability of a slope in fairly uniform soil which is additionally loaded by
a structure built at the top of the slope, however in many soils and in rocks this is some-
376 CHAPTER 11 · Static Loading of the Ground
Fig. 11.15. Canelles dam (after Alvarez and Sancho 1974)
what more difficult because the slope stability may be influenced by particular hori-
zons and by discontinuities. Larnach and Bradshaw (1974) examined the stability of
slopes in limestones and mudstones on which a hotel was to be built overlooking the
Avon Gorge, Bristol, England. They found that the slope had a potential for sliding on
clay layers in a direction oblique to that of the dip of the beds. Their solution to the
problem was to take the foundations of the proposed hotel down to a depth below the
potential sliding plane using deep piles or piers.
It is common for the foundations of bridges to be placed on slopes especially as
bridges tend to be as short as possible and are often located to cross narrow places in
valleys. The valley side in rock will probably be both weathered and relaxed, most in-
tensively weathered along discontinuities so that some may be weaker than others.
Inevitably, bridge foundations tend to be as close to the valley edge as possible and thus in
an area of most severely weathered rock; this has to be either penetrated to sound rock
or supported with cables, anchors, bolts etc. or improved. In such a situation a single
continuous highly weathered discontinuity could determine the stability of the foun-
dation. Placed on one side of it, the foundation could be potentially unstable, where as
if placed on its other side, perhaps only a metre or two away, it is stable (Fig. 1.2).
In the case of arch bridges (without mid-span piers) the thrust of the bridge struc-
ture is not vertical but directed into the valley sides. If there is a possibility of slope
failure into the valley along discontinuities dipping out of the valley side, then the
bridge thrust may improve slope stability by adding to the forces acting normal to the
potential sliding discontinuities. However, it must be remembered that this condition
exists only after completion of the bridge. Until the arch is formed abutment loads
11.8 · Construction Problems 377
tend to be vertical and would therefore increase potential instability. Thus the design
of a foundation on a rock slope should take account of stability both during and after
construction.
11.8
Construction Problems
11.8.1
Foundation Excavations
Recommendations for foundation design based on the results of site investigation have
to include comments on the level of the stratum capable of sustaining the proposed
foundation pressure (without exceeding allowable settlement), the stability of the ex-
cavation sides, likely occurrence of groundwater in the excavation and the method of
excavation.
The foundation material exposed at the bottom of an excavation has been relieved
of the weight of the material removed, and may rebound slightly and so loosen the
ground. This might result in the opening of any discontinuities, perhaps increasing
mass permeability and making it easier for groundwater to flow into the excavation.
If the ground is relatively weak and the excavation deep, the stresses from the side
slopes may cause the foundation ground to bulge upward or heave. Some clays may
take up water and swell, giving a form of ground heave. An excavation may be made
in ground overlying an aquiclude which confines an aquifer containing water under
pressure (Fig. 11.16). As the excavation is deepened the point must come when the
weight of the material overlying the confined aquifer is insufficient to restrain the uplift
pressure i.e.
xγ+yγ<γh (11.14)

where γ, γ and γ are unit weights of near surface ground, aquiclude and water re-

spectively. Excavation can only safely continue if water pressures in the aquifer are
reduced by some form of dewatering around the excavation.

378 CHAPTER 11 · Static Loading of the Ground
Most foundations on rock are too shallow to reach unweathered rock mass; open
joints, erosion gullies and so forth may be encountered. Having established that these
are not indications of a greater problem, such as karst at depth, mine collapse,
landsliding, etc., they are generally first cleaned out as well as possible and then back-
filled with compacted concrete or grout, to restore the integrity of the mass so that,
following the principles outlined above, the ground becomes more like that of the
material than its weathered mass.
The rock mass examination and any remedial works should be undertaken as soon
as possible after excavation, for weathering and decay starts as soon as the ground is
exposed. While in many rocks the effect is not particularly significant if the period of
exposure is a few weeks, in some rocks it could be quite serious. The clayey rocks, the
mudstones, shales, siltstones and similar materials can be particularly susceptible to
swelling phenomena or may simply decay due to wetting and drying, freezing and
thawing and temperature changes. Rocks containing readily soluble minerals such as
rock salt and gypsum should also be protected. One answer to this problem is to seal
newly exposed rock by covering it with a thin layer of concrete (as shotcrete, or gunite
or some similar grout-like mixture). This may be removed if need be before casting
foundation concrete on freshly excavated rock.
The sides of any excavation must be stable during construction of the foundation,
and consideration should be given to the design of these slopes and, if necessary, the
means of temporarily supporting them.
11.8.2
Stepped Foundations
A foundation may be constructed on a slope in such a way as to avoid problems of
foundation stability, but difficulties could arise for particular foundation elements
within the foundation excavation itself. Thus, for example, if a foundation, compris-
ing multiple pad footings, is constructed on sloping ground, steps may have to be ex-
cavated in the slope onto which the pads will be cast, so that some will be on a higher
level than others. Depending on the height of the steps, the spacing of the footings
and rock discontinuity orientation and spacing, some footings could be unstable. In
horizontal foundations the bulbs of stress from each pad footing will overlap to give a
uniform stress field at depth. If the foundation is stepped, then the stress from the
higher foundation will partly increase and distort the stress field under the next lower
foundation, and so on. This might result in unequal settlement across the footing width.
11.8.3
Foundations Piled to Rock
Often rock is too deep to be reached by open excavation from the surface. This depth
will depend on the character of the overburden, whether it requires support, the need
to support adjacent structures, ease of soil disposal and backfilling the excavation, and
the depth of the water table. Generally, if foundations for standard structures have to
be taken to rock because the overlying material is too weak, the maximum depth to
which an excavation can be taken economically is usually 6 to 8 m; if deeper than that
then piles are normally considered. The choice between using driven or bored piles
11.8 · Construction Problems 379
depends on a number of factors, Table 11.4, as pile design is a complex process and
certain parameters have to be derived by site investigation to allow this to take place.
Bored Piles into Rock
Bored and cast-in-place piles ending in rock may penetrate into the rock to pass
through any weakened upper weathered zone. In such ‘rock-socketed’ piles, the end-
bearing load capacity may be the safe bearing capacity of the rock mass times the area
of the pile base, while the skin-friction load capacity is the ‘skin-friction’ per unit area
times the area of the pile shaft within the rock socket. A simple conservative approach
is to assume that end-bearing load capacity plus skin friction load capacity is the
maximum safe carrying capacity of the pile.
In soft rocks the sides of the pile hole may be smooth and values of skin-friction
between pile concrete and rock may be used to calculate total skin friction load. If the
rock is strong it is probable that the sides of the rock socket will be rough so that the
load will be carried by the key between rock and concrete (Fig. 11.17). In such cases
the rock/concrete key rather than the rock at the base of the pile may carry most of
the load, and if so the critical factor in the carrying capacity of the pile is the shear
strength of the weakest member of the rock/concrete key.
Table 11.4. Factors to be considered in choosing between driven and cast-in-place piles

sockets for bored and cast-in-
place piles. The graph (Cole
and Stroud 1976) offers the
factors to complete Eqs. 11.15
and 11.16
Design of such piles best follows pile tests in which skin friction factors and end
bearing factors are measured for the particular rock type. However, such tests are ex-
pensive and on sites with variable rock types a pile test for each rock type would not
be economic. Accordingly, certain empirical formulae have been devised which sug-
gest the depth of rock socket required to carry the pile load. The rock socketed part
of the pile under load may be viewed as a cylindrical shear box test, the shear force
being that imposed by the pile load, which acts vertically, while the normal force is
that imposed by the diametral expansion of the pile in response to the vertical load
(Fig. 11.17). Any formula must take into account shear strengths of rock and concrete
and the load on, and strength of, the rock at the base of the pile. Cole and Stroud (1976)
11.8 · Construction Problems 381
have offered a formula to determine the depth (L) of the rock socket to carry the re-
quired pressure (Q ) to be imposed on the pile. This is:
m
(11.15)
where Q =maximum pressure to be carried by the pile, Q =allowable pressure on
m a
the rock at the base of the pile (its bearing capacity), C =shear strength of the rock
s
in the socket and A=shaft adhesion factor (taken as 0.3).
The authors calculated Q using the formula:
a
(11.16)
where C =shear strength of rock below the pile base, N =bearing capacity factor,
b c
taken as 9 and F=safety factor, usually 3.
Note that this method gives the depth of the rock socket for the pile to carry the
required load, but does not indicate the pile settlement. However, the method is con-
sidered conservative so that piles designed by this method will usually give settlements
under the working load within the limits of tolerance of a normal structure. The
method takes no account of the roughness of the socket wall and the relative strengths
of concrete and rock. Most rock sockets are examined before placing concrete and the
observer may decide, if the rock surface is rough and strong, to reduce socket depth.
Alternatively, if the rock is weak and the surface smooth and muddy, it may be pru-
dent to be conservative.
Driven Piles into Rock
In ‘hard’ rock it is unlikely that the pile can be driven for any significant depth and so
this is an unlikely construction technique for use in such ground. On ‘soft’ rock the
pile may be driven considerable depths. Piles may be heavily reinforced concrete with
a steel point, or steel cylinders or ‘H’ beams. The piles have usually to be very strong
so that they can withstand the hammering required to obtain the penetration to en-
sure lateral stability. Piles can pass down through weak soils to meet a rockhead that
slopes steeply. As with the stepped foundation, higher piles might give additional load
to lower piles; further if a group of such piles is loaded the lateral resistance of the
soil may be inadequate to restrain the pile toes from slipping on the inclined rockhead
surface. Steeply inclined rockhead topographies are common in glaciated areas espe-
cially on the sides of fjords, which often form the sites of jetties for shipping; such jet-
ties would be founded on driven piles. Since many fjords are also in hard rock, the
problem of the pile penetrating into rockhead to give support against slippage over
rockhead, is one of importance. To overcome this, hardened steel tips may be welded
on to the end of a conventional ‘H’ steel pile and serve to gain a few centimetres pen-
etration.
382 CHAPTER 11 · Static Loading of the Ground
Such piles are not readily commercially available and have to be especially manu-
factured. Accordingly it is very important for the engineering geologist to:
1. recognise the geomorphological history of the area, to suspect that rockhead may
be steeply inclined beneath soft soils, and
2. design an investigation to determine the topography of rockhead and nature of the
overlying soil, so as to allow pile toe and pile lengths to be designed.
In marine structures ‘dolphins’ may have ‘raker’ piles inclined from the vertical. In
such a case recognition of rockhead topography is also clearly important.
Piles driven into soft rocks (weak sandstones, shales, mudstones, marls, chalks and
the like), are largely held in place by the shearing resistance between the pile and the
rock. This becomes greater as more pile length is driven and greater depth is reached
because lateral pressures increase until, for that particular type of pile and hammer,
the pile reaches a ‘set’. In soft rocks the first ‘set’ may be transitory because the rock
may ‘relax’ and the forces holding the pile diminish. Accordingly it is common to re-
drive a pile in soft rock for a second time, possibly after some days. The cause of this
relaxation is not fully understood but suspected to be related to the re-establishment
of porewater pressures reduced by dilation of the ground during pile driving.
In soft chalk it has been possible to drive piles for many metres penetration with-
out reaching a set, only to find that if the pile is left for a few days it will bear the working
load. The precise nature of this phenomenon is also unclear, but evidently the rock is
pulverised by driving and, if saturated, becomes a liquid with little frictional resis-
tance to shaft penetration. However, if the ground is left to ‘settle’, (during which time
some of the pore pressure generated by piling drains away and permits frictional re-
sistance between the ground and the pile to be re-established) the rock resumes a pro-
portion of its original strength, grips the pile shaft and provides end and side bearing
resistance.
It is quite possible that rockhead is irregular; this may be discovered as the piling
progresses (Fig. 11.18a). It is thus always better to begin piling from the lowest level
of rockhead and to work upwards, for the opportunity then exists to modify pile de-
sign (Fig. 11.18b). Whether or not this is a major problem will also depend upon the
lateral resistance offered by the overburden soils but, clearly, investigations for struc-
tures that may be founded on piles over a buried valley should include defining the shape
of the valley.
It should be noted that piles, either driven or cast-in-place, may heavily and locally
load rock and attention should be given to the quality of the foundation material be-
neath piles. The opportunity to inspect the material before pile installation may ar-
gue in favour of a bored, rather than a driven pile foundation.
11.9
Field Assessment of Exposed Foundations
A time comes when the foundation excavations are opened and the suitability of the
foundation mass must be validated by inspection. The engineering geologist examin-
ing the excavation has to consider whether or not the mass exposed conforms to the
11.9 · Field Assessment of Exposed Foundations 383
Fig. 11.18. The correct se-
quence of piling may help over-
come problems caused by steep
rockhead slopes
prognosis of the site investigation and can thus adequately fulfill its function as a foun-
dation. For ordinary structures there is usually no time available to undertake any
material or mass testing of ground, so that only simple techniques may be employed.
When the structure to be built is not a major work like a power station or a dam, it is
likely that the foundation design proposal is based on less information than that which
can be derived from viewing the excavation itself. The site investigation report should
have recommended an allowable bearing pressure for the foundations based on the
geotechnical properties of the foundation mass at a certain depth below surface. The
first part of any inspection is thus to check that the mass exposed corresponds to that
anticipated. This tends to be relatively easy for foundations on soil but may be much
more difficult for rock. The reason for this is that in most cases the rock mass will be
to some degree weathered and weathering may have significantly affected mass prop-
erties, perhaps in an irregular way. If allowable bearing pressures could be gauged by
a rock mass classification then values of parameters, gathered from borehole infor-
mation and utilised in that assessment, could be verified in the field, and if necessary,
384 CHAPTER 11 · Static Loading of the Ground
allowable bearing pressures adjusted. However, no such rock mass classification sys-
tem presently exists; perhaps it soon will.
The author, confronted with this problem, has tried to clarify his own thinking.
Assuming that the site investigation has indicated that the allowable bearing pressure
required by the design engineer can be carried by the rock mass at a particular depth,
the problem reduces to determining whether or not the rock mass exposed conforms
to that expected.
Table 11.5 approaches this problem by first posing a series of questions that the
investigator has to ask of the information derived from a rather ordinary site investi-
gation undertaken using boreholes, with some testing of rock materials. With regard
to bearing capacity the reader will see that, providing the rock mass is composed of
adequately strong materials with closed discontinuities, the only issue is that of the
comparing the foundation pressure with the compressive strength of the rock. With
most fresh rocks this is unlikely to be a problem. However, as is generally recognised,
if discontinuity intensity increases, discontinuities become open, and layer strength
contrasts occur, then either the foundation pressures have to be reduced or the ground
has to be treated to improve its quality.
The same sort of approach may be adopted to examine settlement, utilising the rock
material E value as a ‘baseline’ for assessing best case settlement, thence antici-
secant
pating greater and /or differential settlement as other factors, as indicated in the table,
are taken into account. In the investigation stage the questions are answered as well
as possible from such information as is available.
If the assessment of foundation conditions is found to be correct, no further ac-
tion need be taken. If not, some modification of foundation construction is required.
The actions commonly undertaken include:
i increasing the size of the foundations to reduce bearing pressure,
ii deepening the foundation either to reach a better quality rock mass or to increase
the downward force operating against any upward force coming from failure of
ground beneath the foundations,
iii removing weak materials and replacing by mass concrete, and
iv improving the ground by such techniques as grouting.
Table 11.5 applies to the common foundation excavation on level ground. Should
the foundation be of a bridge, at the top of a sloping valley side, then the excavation
should be examined to see if any discontinuities existed which would allow sliding of
the bridge abutment into the valley. Clearly, each excavation examination should take
account of the particular circumstances pertaining to each structure.
The ideas outlined above apply to structures of modest significance. Structures such
as dams, nuclear power stations, major bridges and the like are of sufficient economic and
social significance to require in situ testing to establish rock mass bearing capacity
and settlement characteristics. However, such tests as the plate bearing test, test only
a comparatively small volume of the mass that may be stressed, and an examination
of the foundation excavation must determine whether or not the ‘sample’ of the mass
tested is representative of the whole. To do this the readily observable rock mass charac-
teristics of the ‘sample’, as given in Table 11.5, must be recorded to allow comparison to
be made with the more extensive rock mass revealed in the foundation excavations.

386 CHAPTER 11 · Static Loading of the Ground
The investigator examining an excavation can only see what is visible and condi-
tions may change below surface. If the excavation is large enough, it may be useful to
measure seismic velocities of the mass, and shear stiffness with depth, to give assur-
ance that mass quality does not deteriorate with depth. Such work takes little time and
would give no undue delay.
The examination of the foundation excavation may well reveal features which were
entirely unanticipated by the investigation. Such features could be minor faults, shear
zones, open joints, solution cavities, mine shafts and such like. How significant these
could be will depend upon the project, but they should not be viewed lightly. They
might be regarded as symptoms of a ‘disease’ which may have a greater influence on site
security than the symptoms themselves. Thus opened joints in a hillside site could be the
result of erosion, glacial shear, old mining subsidence etc. but could also indicate con-
tinuing slope movement. If this last is the cause of open joints then site stability could
be in jeopardy. Waltham et al. (1986) have reported the problems revealed by the foun-
dation excavations for the Remouchamps Viaduct in Belgium. Solution caves in De-
vonian limestones, sufficiently spectacular to be a tourist attraction, were known to
be in the vicinity and had been, as far as possible, mapped. Extensive (by conventional
standards) borehole investigations found no major cavities but foundation excavations
for an abutment and a pier revealed significant caverns. Thereafter further investiga-
tions on all piers on limestone incorporated probe boreholes on a 2 m grid.
The accuracy with which site foundation conditions can be predicted depends on
the complexity of the geology and the opportunity for accurate calculation may not
exist. In such a case the foundation design must allow for an element of geological
uncertainty. This uncertainty as to the nature of the foundation geology is not neces-
sarily a consequence of inadequate investigation. It may be that, for reasons beyond
the control of the investigator, access to all parts of the site is limited. It may also be
that the geology is simply too complex to be unravelled by the available site investiga-
tion techniques, however extensively applied. This is particularly the case with older
rock masses, those which may have suffered several phases of tectonic disturbance and
perhaps also metamorphism. Tight sharp folds, multiple faults and shear zones may
be so closely spaced that correlation between boreholes, even with the aid of geologi-
cal mapping of surface outcrops, may be totally inadequate to reveal the true geologi-
cal situation.
In such a case the investigator must be under no illusions as to the accuracy of any
forecast of sub-surface geology that can be made. It is important to recognise that a
range of possible foundation problems might exist in order that solutions for them
may be devised in alternative foundation designs. These solutions must be allowed
for in the provisions of the construction contract.

Dynamic Loading of the Ground
The ground may be subject to dynamic loading by either natural phenomenon or the
activities of man. Some sources of dynamic loading are the action of heavy machin-
ery, traffic, especially trains, explosions, mine collapse and earthquakes. Vibrations
travel through the ground and may cause damage to property and, at the very least,
annoyance to residents. The public expectation of the severity of the damage likely
to be caused by such vibrations is often much greater than that which takes place,
but it is generally desirable to record accurately their effects. In urban tunnelling
projects, for example, it is prudent to monitor trial blasts and machine noise at ground
level, and, if necessary, adjust blasting and tunnelling procedures to minimise distur-
bance.
While vibrations caused by man are of importance in engineering, the problems
they pose pale into insignificance in comparison with those brought about by earth-
quakes. Earthquakes are a severe natural hazard faced by mankind, as witnessed by
the tsunami from the Banda Aceh earthquake of 26 December 2004, which is estimated
to have killed at least 270000 and left many more homeless; few other natural hazards
kill and damage on this scale.
12.1
Engineering Geology and Earthquakes
To engineer safely in a seismic area it is necessary to possess the following:
1. an estimate of the likely strength, frequency and location of future earthquakes. This
may be assessed from knowledge of the geology of the region around the construc-
tion site and a survey of past earthquake events.
2. knowledge of site geology, in order to assess the ground response to previous earth-
quakes and the likely response of the ground to a future earthquake. This would
determine whether any possibilities existed for phenomena such as liquefaction, land
spreading and flow slides to occur, which are associated with weak saturated depos-
its, often of Quaternary age.
3. an assessment of the likely response of the proposed structure and any other struc-
tures in the vicinity of the proposed structure, to the anticipated tremors.
4. knowledge of the vulnerability of coastal sites (if that is where the structure is to be
built) to sudden flooding by tidal waves (tsunamis) generated by off-shore earth-
quakes that can cause an abrupt vertical displacement of the ocean floor.
388 CHAPTER 12 · Dynamic Loading of the Ground
Attention must be given to the effects of earthquakes on infrastructure (roads, water,
supply, electricity supply, etc.) as well as on the principal constructions so that, in the
event that a major earthquake occurs, sufficient infrastructure remains for relief mea-
sures to be implemented.
12.2
Sources and Characteristics of Earthquakes
Many of the recent and best documented earthquakes can be attributed to movement
along faults associated with either inter-plate or intra-plate adjustments to global plate
movements. Such faults may be continually moving but from time to time move-
ment may be partially or totally restricted by unevenness and lack of planarity on
the fault surface, until sufficient stress builds up to break through the crustal obstruc-
tion. This release of stress and sudden relaxation of elastic stored strain energy in
the ground generates the seismic shock. Many faults give rise to numerous very
small and, to human senses, imperceptible earthquakes which may be described as
“seismic noise”. This may increase prior to a major shock and some earthquakes are
preceded by “foreshocks”, together with small but measurable changes in the charac-
ter of the crust and shape of the ground. The main shock may be followed by “af-
tershocks”, sometimes of a severity close to that of the main shock, and perhaps ex-
tending over a period of many weeks after the main event but with diminishing
strength.
A mechanical shock generates mechanical waves and in an earthquake the waves
are compression (P) and shear (S) (also known as longitudinal and transverse waves,
respectively); the former oscillate particles in the direction of wave travel and for this
have been called “push-pull” waves, the latter at right angles to it. An earthquake also
generates “surface” waves where most of the motion is at ground level; “Love” waves
shake the ground horizontally and “Raleigh” waves move it vertically and horizontally.
The P wave velocity is significantly greater than the S wave velocity. Seismographs
record the time of arrival of waves at a seismic station and there will be a time differ-
ence between P and S wave arrival; that difference increases the further away the ob-
servation station is from the source. If the earthquake is recorded by a number of seis-
mic stations and P and S wave velocities are known, the location of the source or the
“focus” of the earthquake can be established by triangulation. Seismographs commonly
record the accelerations produced by the earthquake as “accelerograms”, which dis-
play components of the accelerations experienced by a particle in three orthogonal
planes, two horizontal and one vertical. Ideally, at a particular station, the P wave
motions are the first to be recorded, principally in the “up/down” component, thence
the S wave motions, and thereafter diminishing surface waves. Accelerations are usu-
ally expressed as proportions of “g”, the acceleration due to gravity, and are commonly
much less than “g”, but have been known to exceed it in very severe earthquakes.
Ground shaking caused by an earthquake is usually of short duration, often less than
one minute between onset and end, while the cycles of “strong motion”, associated with
peak accelerations, occur within a yet shorter period, perhaps less than 10 seconds.
These patterns of movement tend to be quite different from those created by rock bursts
in mines where the stresses are so high that their supporting pillars and tunnel walls
12.2 · Sources and Characteristics of Earthquakes 389
literally burst apart, generating a very short lived local earthquake (known in the mines
as a “bump”). Likewise, underground nuclear explosions radiate a different signal from
natural earthquakes; indeed were it not for the “cold war” and mutual distrust of the
nations our seismic network would not be as good as it is because we were all listen-
ing to each other!
12.2.1
Magnitude
The strength of an earthquake at source is described as its “magnitude”; seismologists
recognise several types of magnitude but two measures are commonly used:
1. Richter Magnitude (M) where
(12.1)
Here, A=maximum amplitude of the wave (10–6 m), T=wave period (secs),
q=function correcting for the distance from the source of the quake, ∆=angular
distance from seismometer to epicentre, h=focal depth of the quake and c=an
empirical constant related to the station and regional characters.
2. Moment Magnitude (M ) where
w
(12.2)
Here, µ=shear modulus, A=ruptured area of the fault, and u=average displace-
ment of the fault. The multiple (µAu) is called the seismic moment of an earthquake
Mo (Nm).
Both magnitudes give roughly similar values but (M) is more closely related to the
effects of a quake, and thus valuable to planners, whereas (M ) relates to the cause of
w
the quake and is thus valuable to scientists. Engineers are interested in both. The Banda
Aceh quake of 26 December 2004 registered 9.0 on the Richter scale and 9.5 for its
Moment magnitude.
These and other magnitudes that can be calculated, are a measure of the energy (E,
in ergs) released by the earthquake at source. For example, the relationship between E
and M is
Log E=12.24+1.44 M (12.3)
10
The magnitude “scale” has no upper limit and because of the logarithmic function
in the equation, one unit of magnitude increase approximates to a 27 times increase
in energy release.
390 CHAPTER 12 · Dynamic Loading of the Ground
12.2.2
Intensity
The “focus” of an earthquake, also called its “hypocentre”, is the point below ground
level where the earthquake nucleates; e.g. where the snag on the fault shears. The
“epicentre” is the point at the ground level, immediately above the focus. A school-
child may observe, by throwing a stone in a pond, that waves passing through a me-
dium lose energy (are “damped” or “attenuated”) with increasing distance from their
source. Earthquake waves are similarly damped and the strength of the shaking ex-
perienced on the surface (the “intensity”) will, to some degree, depend upon the dis-
tance from the earthquake focus to any point where intensity is measured on the
surface.
The amount of damping will depend not only on distance but also on the nature of
the geology through which the wave travels, and to determine how geology influences
intensity seismologists undertake intensity surveys after major earthquakes to pro-
duce intensity maps (Fig. 12.1); these show “isoseismal” lines, i.e. lines joining points
where similar ground motions were experienced; they are assessed by examining the
damage done. Table 12.1 shows a Japanese scale of intensity to illustrate this idea. In
homogeneous ground, and on a regional scale, the isoseismals should be almost cir-
cular – like the waves from a stone thrown into water, but distortions may reveal broad
geological structure.
Various isoseismal scales have been developed over the years. One commonly used
in Europe and America is the Modified Mercalli (MM) scale which has twelve inten-
sity grades. The MSK scale (after Medvedev, Sponheuer and Kárník), is a modifica-
tion of this (Grünthal 1993), and there are others, each modification trying to pro-
duce more accurate criteria for intensity assessment. One problem has always been
that the damage to a structure depends not only on the strength of shaking, i.e. ground
movement, but also the type of structure, its age and condition. In the very detailed
Herkenbosch study (Fig. 12.2) intensities (as judged from structural damage to prop-
erty) varied from house to house! (Den Outer et al. 1994).
The European Macroseismic Scale of intensity (Grünthal 1993) recognises (a) the
difference between intensity effects on humans, objects and nature, and damage to
structures, (b) five different classes of structural damage (Grade 1=least damage;

12.3 · Liquefaction 391
Table 12.1. Japanese (JMA) seismic intensity scale
Grade 5=greatest damage), and (c) six different classes of vulnerability of structure.
Table 12.2 presents a précis of the scale.
As the strength of shaking is related to the acceleration of particles, attempts have
been made to relate acceleration to intensity; Table 12.3 illustrates one example (for
the original see Okamoto 1973).
12.2.3
Amplification
The damage accompanying earthquakes often depends upon the nature of the soil im-
mediately underlying structures. In the 1944 Tonankai earthquake in Japan (Okamoto
1973), 26% of the houses that totally collapsed were founded on clay, 3.5% were on sand,
1.4% were on gravel and 0.2% were on rock. The general experience is that the softer the
ground the greater the shaking. This phenomenon is known as amplification (Fig. 12.3).
Amplification ratios (surface shaking to bedrock shaking) may be as much as 4 to 1.
The implication is that, if it is possible to do so, structures are best not built on soft ground.
If they must be built on such ground precautions against damage should be taken.
12.3
Liquefaction
Deposits of loose silts and fine sands, without significant clay content to fill the voids
between the particles and bind the silt and sand particles together, will attempt to
compact when shaken (i.e. the volume they occupy will “contract”, in soil mechanics

terms). If these materials are saturated no compaction can take place until the water
is driven from their pores. However the low permeability of fine grained soils (in com-
parison with coarser granular materials) prevents this taking place rapidly. Consequently,
if the shaking is strong enough and continues long enough, pore pressures build up
until the granular material with water in the pores becomes water with grains in sus-
pension; i.e. it becomes a quicksand. This is “liquefaction” and it may drive fine sand in
suspension upwards to appear at surface as “sand volcanoes”; evidence that this has oc-
curred may be seen in excavations (Fig. 12.4). If these, and other features, can be found
in association with datable deposits then the approximate date and magnitude of the
earthquake that caused them can be established (Davenport and Ringrose 1985, 1987).
When liquefaction happens, and usually it occurs 6 to 8 m below ground level, struc-
tures may sink into the ground by foundation failure, often tilting severely. Buried

artefacts, such as petrol filled tanks in garages, pipelines and sewers, may float and
rise up to surface. If liquefaction occurs under sloping ground then the whole mass
resting on a liquefied layer, may move down slope. A classical example of an earth-
quake causing liquefaction was at Niigata, Japan in 1964; there, slopes on either side
of the River Shinano moved into the river by as much as 23 m (Hamada et al. 1987).
Interestingly areas with SPT-N-values (Chap. 6) of 0 to 10 suffered severe damage whilst
those of 20 to 40 suffered no damage and it is frequently found that the lower the rela-
tive density of the silt or fine sand the greater is its likelihood to liquefy (Seed and
Idriss 1971). Great reliance is thus placed on measurements of the in situ relative den-
sity of sands using the Standard Penetration Test, but this is an empirical test, which
requires exact adherence to standard procedures, equipment, and corrections to the
results for reasonable and comparable data to be obtained. The thickness of material
liquefying does not have to be great; thin lenses of saturated fine sand, if liquefied,
may render any slope containing them unstable.
The reader may wonder why such attention is given to the liquefaction of fine satu-
rated sands as an earthquake related hazard. Many earthquake prone areas in the world
are associated with high mountain ranges near to the sea. Rivers from the mountains
can deposit fine sediments as coastal alluvial plains at the foot of the mountains which,
being flat and near water, are ideal locations for agriculture and development. Often
the wide river mouths and deltas are also suitable for harbours, river transport and
industrial development. Thus the areas most attractive for human settlement can
readily be associated with those factors conducive to liquefaction.

12.4
Other Effects of Earthquakes
Earthquake intensity may be assessed as a proportion of “g”, the strength of the earth’s
gravitational acceleration. During an earthquake the local “g” will change and any fea-
ture which depends upon the value of “g” for its stability may become unstable. Thus a
slope whose stability is related to the weight of ground above a potential sliding sur-
face may become unstable, because the downward forces promoting stability may be
reduced relative to the horizontal forces promoting instability, which could also be
increased. Most major earthquakes in mountainous areas are associated with wide-
spread landslides arising from an imbalance of forces which promotes rapid displace-
ments that can cause such an increase in porewater pressures within the ground that
the near surface masses so affected are able to flow like a fluid, downslope, sometimes
with great speed and devastating effects.
Foundations of buildings are designed assuming a given load intensity on the
ground. This may increase during the earthquake, perhaps sufficiently to cause foun-
dation failure. Ground waves can cause lateral movements in foundations which may
not all be in the same direction at the same time, bringing about failure of structural
columns.
Earthquakes may be caused by fault rupture and such ruptures may extend to the
surface with severe effects on any structures above or below ground. Ground shaking
may damage buried pipelines and cables, disrupting supplies of water, gas, electricity
and the disposal of sewage. Water well casing may be damaged, cutting off supplies of
groundwater. Water levels in aquifers may be temporarily or permanently disturbed.
As mentioned earlier, much more widespread damage can follow a fault rupture that
displaces the ocean floor and generates a tsunami
12.5
Assessing Seismic Risk and Seismic Hazard
The term seismic risk indicates the likelihood that earthquakes of given intensities or
magnitudes will occur within an area or at a site. The basic data required to assess
seismic risk is a catalogue of past events and an understanding of regional geology.
Accurate and complete earthquake records are a recent development; seismograph
networks were limited before the 1950s. Before this century accounts of seismic events
are more journalistic than scientific and before the 17th century records are very sparse
indeed. To extend the seismic record to earlier than about 4000 years ago ‘palaeoseismic’
studies are undertaken; these seek geomorphological and soil structure information
(as in Fig. 12.4) which can be used to indicate whether a major seismic event had oc-
curred (Fig. 12.5)
Figure 12.5 illustrates a river meandering between its terraces (a) and (b). Faulting
accompanying an earthquake in pre-historic times, ruptures the ground, displacing
the terraces laterally, and downthrowing them towards the south. The river channel is
also displaced. This geomorphological record records the presence of an active fault
and to study that further a N-S trench is excavated across its likely position. The trench
exposes displaced strata unconformably covered by recent alluvium. Dating the fault

and thus the earthquake may be possible as it can be no younger than the alluvium
and no older than the strata it displaces.
If the seismic catalogue is adequate, maps may be produced displaying, in some
fashion, varying degrees of risk of earthquakes in a specific area. Figure 12.6 is a seis-
mic zoning map for northwest Germany and the Benelux countries, showing maxi-
mum expected intensities (MM scale). A comparison between this figure and Fig. 12.1
shows that the credibility of this map was verified by the 1992 Roermond earthquake.
This type of map leaves it to the user to determine the damage that may ensue from
an anticipated earthquake. Other maps, such as some published in the United States,
may link such predictions to building codes recommending structure strengthening
against earthquake damage.
For major structures whose failure would have serious consequences for society,
special studies are required to evaluate seismic risk. The first task is to establish the
“design” earthquake; that is, the earthquake whose effects the project must resist. The
characteristics to be established are its possible location, magnitude, duration, and
intensity and its frequency of occurrence. Location may be established from regional
and local geological studies and the seismic record. The magnitude may be estimated
by assessing the length of fault rupture which could occur to generate the next earth-
quake, while the duration, of cycles of strong motion in particular, is related to mag-
nitude. The intensity at a site will depend upon its distance from the focus and attenu-
ation factors which have been derived from intensity studies of past earthquakes, such
as illustrated in Fig. 12.1. Frequency of occurrence may be assessed from the seismic
record.
Establishing the design earthquake requires not only the assembly of information
relative to the site but a review of the latest methods of parameter assessment. Once
the design earthquake has been established, the task of the engineering geologist is to
assess site response. This requires a study of soils, rocks, geomorphology and geohy-
drology to assess how the ground may react to the design earthquake. Thus, attention
would be given to assessing the characteristics of ground with a potential for lique-
faction, and calculating the stability of slopes that could fail. Faults should be located
to see if, should they rupture, major damage would be caused. All associated hazards
should also be evaluated.

Ground Engineering Design against Earthquake Hazards
The surface of the earth may be divided into zones each characterised by one of three
grades of seismic risk. In the first, earthquakes have been observed to occur either very
rarely or never, in the second earthquakes giving some damage occasionally occur and
in the third damaging earthquakes frequently occur and become a part of life. The
second gives the greatest difficulty for not only is the seismic record likely to be in-
complete but the public may not perceive earthquakes as a hazard requiring special,
and possibly expensive, engineering precautions; only an “unexpected” and possibly
damaging earthquake may sharpen that perception.
However, having established that a hazard exists, engineering design may be em-
ployed to mitigate the damage that could result. Every building rests on a foundation
and static foundation designs may be modified to allow for dynamic loading. One
approach in Japan (Okamoto 1973) has been to divide the country into areas with
particular seismic coefficients which relate to expected intensities of shaking. In
Table 12.4 the seismic coefficient k is 0 for static conditions rising to a maximum of 0.4
for maximum shaking. The Terzaghi bearing capacity factors are thence reduced as k
increases to give larger area footings (and thus less bearing pressure) to compensate
for increased loading under dynamic conditions. The reader can be forgiven for feel-
ing this all sounds too simple a solution and the author admits that here only the ba-
sic ideas of 30 years ago are described as at that time the concepts were simple enough
for most engineers to understand them.
12.6 · Ground Engineering Design against Earthquake Hazards 399
Table 12.4. Modification of
bearing capacity factors for

(simplified from Okamoto
1973)
Earthquake engineers can be said to design against “the last earthquake”, for each
new event may reveal the success or failure of some previous approach. For example,
one idea to combat damage from liquefaction was to build on piles to a bearing stra-
tum below the liquefiable layer. Hamada et al. (1987) described how a building, dam-
aged in the 1964 Niigata earthquake, was 20 years later scheduled for reconstruction.
As part of this work the old pile foundations were excavated to examine their condi-
tion. Out of a total of 304 piles, 74 were excavated and most of these were found dam-
aged, showing fracture displacements in a direction corresponding to that of the per-
manent ground movements and suspected to be a consequence of liquefaction. Clearly,
piled foundations alone are not the answer to liquefaction; if liquefaction induces lat-
eral movement piled foundations may be damaged and even if this does not occur,
the loss of lateral support to the pile in the liquefied layer may cause damage as piles
and building shake.
Greater benefits can be obtained by improving the ground where possible so that it
is not weakened by shaking. Paradoxically, the most commonly used technique in sands
and silts is to increase their relative density by giving them a good shake, where nec-
essary induced by dynamic loading! The objective is to attain a relative density which
safeguards the deposit against liquefaction from the earthquake the structure is de-
signed to withstand. This might be achieved by the process of vibroflotation, in which
a vibrating cylinder, the vibroflot, is jetted into the ground, and then vibrates the ground
so expelling water from its pores and enabling the material around it to consolidate
and strengthen. In the 1968 Off-Tokachi earthquake, which gave MM intensity IX at
the site of the Hachinohe paper mill, surrounding untreated ground cracked and liq-
uefied, while buildings on the consolidated ground suffered only light damage
(Okamoto 1973). Ground improvement may be monitored by in situ testing using the
Standard Penetration Test, the static cone test or the Menard pressuremeter, and geo-
physical methods. The seismic design of engineered structures is continually improv-
ing to accommodate the most recent experiences.
12.7
After the Earthquake
The number of casualties caused by an earthquake is, to some degree, a matter of
chance. In relatively primitive agricultural areas where the inhabitants may dwell in
adobe buildings with heavy roofs, there are likely to be many more casualties if the
earthquake occurs at night when all are asleep in their readily collapsible homes than
if it occurs by day when most are working in the fields. The 1992 Roermond earth-
quake, which occurred at 3:20 A.M. on a Monday morning, caused almost no casualties
400 CHAPTER 12 · Dynamic Loading of the Ground
although many chimneys fell into the streets. Had it occurred on the previous Satur-
day afternoon, when the area was densely crowded with shoppers, the consequences
would have been much more serious. However, while few may be killed during the
earthquake, many more may die after it due to the destruction of engineering works
of social significance. Thus in past earthquakes most deaths have occurred due to fire,
disease, and exposure, or to civil unrest consequent to the earthquake.
Earthquakes located off shore usually kill no one but if they initiate a tsunami their
effect on coastal communities thousands of kilometres away and in different lands,
can be devastating; the quake of 2004 at Banda Aceh was such an event.
Accordingly, in earthquake-prone regions attention must be given to protecting
those engineering works, such as roads, bridges, airports, water reservoirs and deliv-
ery systems, which will allow relief measures to take place. As far as ground engineer-
ing is concerned this includes ensuring that roads are not blocked by landslides, run-
ways and hospitals are located in safe places and all are designed to resist dynamic
loading.

Ground Reaction to Changes of Fluid and Gas Pressures
13.1
Subsidence due to the Pumping Out of Fluid
The fluids found naturally underground are groundwater, oil and gas. Of these the fluid
most familiar to engineers and most frequently encountered in civil engineering is
groundwater. Groundwater is derived from rainfall and when rain infiltrates the ground
it recharges the groundwater reserves that are there; if this occurs at a certain rate water
levels will rise and with them the water pressure in the pores and fissures of the ground.
This water will be draining towards a river valley and ultimately to the sea. It is when
the rate of recharge is greater than the rate of drainage (or discharge) that water level
will rise. When the reverse is the case, water levels will fall. Any measure of natural
water levels will show they rise and fall with time in a seasonal way, perhaps over a
few tens of metres. Pore water pressures will likewise rise and fall in a seasonal way
too.
This natural cycle has superimposed upon it an artificially stimulated set of changes
when wells are sunk and fluids are pumped from the ground. Such unnatural changes
in fluid levels, due to the withdrawal of water, are almost entirely due to the activities
of man. Wells are sunk into aquifers and petroleum reservoirs to permit their fluids
to escape up them in a controlled manner but this reduces the pore pressures in them;
as fluid pressure reduces so fluid levels reduce too. This reduction in pressure brings
about changes in the balance between the total stresses in the ground coming from its
self weight, and the pressure of fluids in its pores; i.e. the effective stresses within the
ground. These stress changes cause consolidation of the ground in the areas where fluid
pressure has been reduced; i.e. its particles move more closely together; the density
of the ground increases and because of that the strength of the ground usually increases
as well.
Consolidation causes settlement in oil and gas reservoirs and groundwater aqui-
fers, which occurs with time and can be explained as follows. The pressure of oil or
gas or water in situ depends mainly on its depth. The weight of the overburden at that
depth acts partially through the grain structure of the fluid bearing rock and partially
through the fluid itself. During fluid withdrawal, the pressure on the fluid will decline
so upsetting the balance of forces and transferring more of the overburden weight to
the grain structure; in other words, the effective stress will increase. The rate of increase
will be the same as the rate of pressure decrease, however, for reasons explained later,
the response of the ground i.e. consolidation and settlement, can be either at a simi-
lar rate or at a much slower rate than this.
402 CHAPTER 13 · Ground Reaction to Changes of Fluid and Gas Pressures
13.1.1
The Principle of Effective Stress
A porous mass such as soil, and to a certain extent, rock, consists of particles surrounded
by pore spaces. These pore spaces may be filled with air, water, oil or gas. The contents
of the pore spaces can be thought of as offering some support to the particles they sur-
round. If the contents are strong, as can be the case when pores contain mineral cement,
the support they offer can be considerable and much force is required to move the
particles – the material will be strong; it will be able to resist deformation under load,
in particular it can resist shear. If the pore contents are weak, and fluids have little or
no shear strength, then the support they offer is small especially if the fluids can move
– the material will be weak and offer little resistance to deformation under load.
Consider porous ground where the pore spaces are filled with air under normal
atmospheric pressure. At any point below ground surface, the weight of the material
above that point is almost entirely carried by the solid skeleton of particles because
the air around the particles can offer only its pressure as a support. In Fig. 13.1a the
small arrows indicate load carrying point contacts between grains. In such a case the
total load per unit area (σ) on the base of the element of ground equals h (the height of
the element) times γ (the unit weight of the dry ground) and may be described as the
“effective pressure or effective stress” (σ') at that depth, the resultant of all the contacts.
Fig. 13.1. Effective stress
13.1 · Subsidence due to the Pumping Out of Fluid 403
If the fluid, be it a liquid or a gas is under an additional pressure and cannot escape
from the pores then its support to the grains increases; indeed it has been shown time
and again that when a fluid of given pressure ‘u’ exists in pores then the total pressure
at a depth in the sample is given by either
σ=σ'+u (13.1)
or
σ'=σ–u (13.2)
Figure 13.1b shows the stresses on a point A below ground level when water pres-
sures change. In (i) the effective stress σ' at point A is given, following Archimedes’
principle, by either
(13.3)
or
(13.4)
where γ=unit weight of solids and γ =unit weight of water.
g w
However, if the water table is lowered below the level of point A, as in (ii)
(13.5)
The effective stress on point A has thus been increased by (γ ×h ) and there has
w 1
been a gradual increase in effective stress in the soil through the h zone. This pro-
1
duces deformation of the soil within the zone, leading to consolidation of the zone
and to surface subsidence.
The terms “consolidation” and “compaction” cause some confusion. Geotechnical
engineers in soil mechanics, rock mechanics and engineering geology, use the term
consolidation to mean a reduction in pore space as result of increase in effective stress
and “compaction” to describe densification of soils by mechanical tools to increase the
soil strength (i.e. for road embankments). The term compaction is used by petroleum
engineers to define reduction in pore spaces of soils or rock produced by an hydro-
carbon extraction; in other words, consolidation due to an increase in effective stress.
In this context the two words are synonymous.
The equations describing either process can be stated in a simple way; total settle-
ment at the surface, ∆h, is related to the deformation properties of the ground, the
reduction of the fluid pressure ∆u (=the increase of the effective stress, ∆σ') and the
thickness h of the formation in which the pressure declines.
The basic formula to calculate total consolidation when time is infinity is of the form:
∆h=m ×∆σ'×h (13.6)
v
404 CHAPTER 13 · Ground Reaction to Changes of Fluid and Gas Pressures
where m is the coefficient of volume compressibility and is defined as the relative
v
reduction in length per unit of stress increase in an axial direction under a constant
loading rate in the stress range ∆σ'.
In order to predict the compaction behaviour of a producing aquifer or reservoir
the following information is required:
(cid:1) the full extent of the reservoir area expected to be subject to pressure decline;
(cid:1) a map of reservoir body thickness (h), including the area beyond the field where
pumping is to be undertaken (remember these fluids will flow from outside the area
being pumped towards the pumps – that is why wells “work”;
(cid:1) a prediction, based on future field development, of the reduction in fluid pressure
that is anticipated at each point of the reservoir, i.e. the distribution of ∆u or ∆σ' at
a given time;
(cid:1) the coefficient m , which is best measured in situ but failing that on representative
v
samples using appropriate apparatus and procedures.
These “simple” models describe and are therefore used to predict “final settlement”
however it is important to appreciate that the time taken for this settlement to occur
can be many years, depending on the permeability of the soil or rock, and on the length
of the drainage path for the pore fluid. Terzaghi (1925) presented a pioneering publi-
cation on the concept and a mathematical model for describing consolidation with
time. Many subsequent workers, notably Biot (1941), Koppejan (1948), Gibson et al.
(1967) and Den Haan (1992) have since refined and adapted the basic concepts of his
model so that several metre high piles of papers could be assembled on the subject,
each consolidating under its own weight. These papers not only describe consolida-
tion processes but also present case histories where ground response to pumping can
be explained using this model.
Helm (1984) has reviewed many of these computational techniques and their as-
sumptions. Subsidence calculations based on formulae such as Eq. 13.6 assume uni-
formity in the consolidation characteristics of the ground. Such assumptions must be
verified by field data to obtain layer thickness and by field and laboratory measure-
ments to investigate the consolidation properties of the individual layers. The whole
exercise is much helped by survey levelling and deep observation wells.
13.1.2
The Role of the Engineering Geologist
It is easy to become overwhelmed by the mathematics and mechanics of the calcula-
tions involved with predictions of settlement but these efforts are worthless if the
ground model they use is incorrect. The role of the engineering geologist is thus clearly
defined; it is to supply the correct ground model. The ground has to be divided into
layers and zones that can be ascribed typical values for their mechanical and hydrau-
lic properties. This means the vertical profile has to be known, especially the presence
and thickness of potential confining layers; that requires the sensible location of bore-
holes based on the existing knowledge of local geology, good drilling and meticulous
core logging. The lateral variation of these vertical profiles needs also to be established
particularly if they are bounded by faults. This is another way of saying that the bound-
13.2 · Water 405
aries of the problem need to be defined. The next aspect to define is the fluid pressure
at depth; it will not be uniform and changes can be quite marked across low perme-
ability boundaries. Such changes are often only detected during drilling and unless
the drilling equipment is able to detect and record such changes they will have to be
noted by the engineering geologist on site; in other words, drilling for these studies
requires on site supervision. Lithologies, levels and pressures all constitute what is
described by numerical modellers as the initial conditions. But they are not sufficient
to complete the prediction; values for compressibility are required for the layers and
zones defined, and obtaining them can be a major problem. Sometimes values of hori-
zontal stress are also requested – and obtaining them is an even greater problem.
Samples for testing need to be selected and protected from the effects of distur-
bance, especially from stress relief. In many cases such disturbance is impossible to
prevent and the best method by far is to change fluid pressures in the ground and
measure how the ground responds; i.e. to undertake appropriate in situ trials from
which values for stiffness and compressibility which link cause (i.e. fluid pressure re-
duction) to effect(settlement at ground level) can be calculated. That will need instru-
mentation and monitoring prior to field testing, and for this the position of the in-
struments has to be defined both in plan and in vertical section; they must be related
to the relevant geology and vertical settlement across the most compressible layer needs
to be measured.
Finally, the engineering geologist should be consulted over the likely variability of
surface settlement because it is unlikely to be uniform. Near surface geology is rel-
evant to this assessment, especially the location and nature of Quaternary deposits;
air photos and mapping of the near surface deposits can be of considerable value in
this aspect of the work. Risk assessments for likely damage to property cannot be com-
pleted sensibly without such mapping.
In the following sections examples will be given of settlement and the circumstances
associated with it; in each case the principles outlined above can be clearly seen.
13.2
Water
Groundwater occurs in aquifers which may be “unconfined” at some locations i.e. have
their upper surface at ground level (you can walk on them), and “confined” elsewhere
i.e. their upper surface is not at ground level but under a confining layer. The situa-
tion shown in Fig. 13.1b is that for an unconfined aquifer and lowering of the ground-
water table within it gradually increases the effective stress with depth below the origi-
nal groundwater level, in both the drained and saturated zones. In Fig. 13.2 an aquifer
is confined between two low permeability layers (“aquitards”) and the water pressure
within it results from water levels outside the confined zone.
When water is pumped from the confining layer, fluid pressures drop and the layer
and its confining layers (where pressures will also drop but more slowly) will tend to
consolidate; if the aquifer and its confining layers form a mechanically stiff rock mass
the consolidation is likely to be small. If the aquifer and its confining layers are more
soil-like, e.g. uncemented sediments, then consolidation can be large. Such responses
have been understood for almost a century and were well set out by Meinzer (1928)
and Terzaghi (1929). Extraction of water from compressible ground has resulted in

considerable settlement in Venice, Bangkok and in many delta systems around the
world (Table 13.1). A frequent occurrence in Venice, largely as a consequence of sub-
sidence following water extraction from aquifers at depth, is the periodic flooding of
St. Marks Square when tides are high at the northern end of the Adriatic, Fig. 13.3.
(The photograph shows Professor Helm walking along a cat-walk leading to the Ca-
thedral as part of the Seventh International Symposium on Land Subsidence; 2000).
The imperceptible lowering of the land associated with groundwater extraction is of-
ten only realised by the increased frequency of flooding, when people begin to realise
that “something is happening”; by the time survey levelling reveals the presence of
subsidence it is usually much too late to rectify the causes of the subsidence i.e. exces-
sive pumping.
How could this situation have been allowed to happen? It is unfortunately the case
that when water supplies are required it is the properties of aquifers and associated
aquicludes that are gathered (aquifer yield, drawdown/pressures, water quality and
recharge obtained from pumping tests and monitoring of observation wells); little if
any regard seems to be given to the consolidation properties of these formations, sug-
gesting that the consequences of extraction in relation to subsidence is not an issue
for water supply even though consolidation is irreversible. The engineering geologist
must be aware of the dangers of this hydro-schizophrenia.
13.2.1
Subsidence in Unconfined Aquifers
Subsidence from the reduction in groundwater levels in unconfined aquifers may be
complicated by other aspects of geological variability in addition to layer variability,
lateral variations and the like, because recent near surface deposits are capable of hav-
13.2 · Water 407
Table 13.1. Settlement in major
cities (Dolan and Goodell 1986)
ing considerable variation in their thickness. Figure 13.4 (Foose 1968) shows how the
non-uniform compaction of unconfined aquifer sediments infilling valleys in the bed-
rock below may give rise to differential settlement and surface shearing.
In areas where pinnacle weathered limestone is overlain unconformably by more
recent soil deposits the further removal of carbonates or soil infill by groundwater
movement may result in the development of soil arches spanning cavities within the
rock (Fig. 13.5). If the groundwater table is lowered, say from level A to level B in
Fig. 13.5, stresses in the arches can increase to the point where they cause failure. Col-
lapse of the arch permits sudden settlement and subsidence at ground level.
Foose (1968) records how increased pumping from a mine in the Hershey Valley,
Pennsylvania, lowered the groundwater table in sediments over an irregular bedrock
surface in Ordovician limestones, and brought about the development of such sink-
holes. When the groundwater table was allowed to recover to its former levels the de-
velopment of further sinkholes ceased. Such sinkholes may be very large. In Decem-
ber 1962 a mine crusher station near Johannesburg, South Africa fell into a sinkhole
30 m deep and 55 m wide, with the loss of 29 lives.
Such soil bridged cavities may occur anywhere where soil covers irregular solution
weathered limestone rockhead. Concentrated water inflows, as may be formed by soak-
aways, used to allow surface water to drain away from newly built roads and housing
developments, can cause the soil bridges to fail and sinkholes to develop in ground
prone to this.

13.2.2
Subsidence in Confined Aquifers
The vulnerability of confined aquifers to consolidation comes from the fact that their
confining layers can permit much higher water pressures to be developed within them
than occurs in unconfined aquifers; so high that at times wells drilled into them bring
water gushing to the surface as a fountain (these are called artesian wells). Pumping
can produce considerable lowering of water pressures in such aquifers with an equally
considerable increase of vertical effective stress within them, and hence consolida-
tion. Figure 13.6 shows a typical subsidence bowl developed by the extraction of
groundwater beneath the city of Hanoi, Vietnam (Nguyen and Helm 1995). Ground-
water is taken from an unconfined aquifer and a lower confined aquifer, separated from
it by a layer of compressible clay. Since the beginning of extraction in the early part of
the century when the water levels were 2 to 5 m below ground level, the piezometric
level in deep wells has sunk into the confined aquifers, and fallen to 37 to 40 m, as
measured in 1993. This has not only caused the confined aquifer to consolidate but
also has initiated consolidation in the confining compressible clays.

A similar situation is to be found in the city of Bangkok, Thailand. The city is situ-
ated about 40 km from the sea on either side of the Chao Phrava River which runs
through a large flat deltaic plain. This delta fills of a broad deep basin with recent sedi-
ments and available evidence suggests that these have formed nine confined sand and
gravel aquifers, separated by clay strata of very low permeability (Young et al. 1995).
The profile of the surface of the bedrock is still undetermined, but its depth in the
Bangkok area is known to be between about 550 and 2000 m below ground level. The
city is generally only 1 to 1.5 m above mean sea level.
Water has been extracted from these deltaic unconsolidated sediments at an ever
increasing rate since 1960 with the result that there are now serious hydrological and
geotechnical problems associated with depletion of aquifers, arising from a deterio-
ration of water quality as saline water is drawn into the aquifers, and general land
subsidence. The large draw downs in the piezometric level of the main production
aquifers, has resulted in the installation of deeper and deeper wells, thus making the
problem worse. Some consolidation of the aquifers has occurred but much greater
consolidation of the intervening clays and overlying near surface clays has been re-
corded; remember, recently deposited clays tend to have porosities of >60%, much

greater than those of sands and gravels (<30%) and thus will suffer greater changes
in thickness on consolidation.
Maximum subsidence in 1978 was 75 cm but by 1980 the maximum rate of subsid-
ence was of the order of 10 cm per year. Alarm at the settlement caused this to be re-
duced to between 4 and 5 cm per year by 1988, by reducing pumping rates (Phien-Wej
et al. 1989). Figure 13.7 illustrates some of the effects witnessed there; consolidation
of the upper soft clay causes the pump house of water wells to sink onto the pump
causing the well to fail – another is then sunk, a little deeper this time. Buildings
founded on piles taken to the sand aquifer are bordered by roads founded on the clay
that has consolidated; this separates from the building but more dangerously can drag
down the piles and cause them to fail. These are the consequence of pumping water
from the shallowest aquifer. Subsidence from pumping the deeper aquifers could dam-
age any structure whose foundations were taken down to below the upper aquifer. All
structures, perhaps already damaged from shallow aquifer subsidence, will suffer a
change in elevation as a consequence of deeper aquifer and aquitard compaction. A
similar situation exists in Mexico City.
Significant subsidence problems are not necessarily associated with the extraction
of large quantities of groundwater; small quantities can also have dramatic effects. In
Stockholm, hollows in the bedrock scoured by glaciers, sometimes over crush zones,
may be filled with clay to give isolated “clay lakes”, each with its own water table
(Morfeldt 1970). Tunnel boring under these areas may experience slight seepages
through crush zones, of little significance to either tunnel construction or stability.
However, such drainage lowers the water table in the clay lake, producing consolida-
tion, subsidence and marked differential settlement, with serious damage to structures
at ground level. Here uneven bedrock and changes in thickness of the compressible
layer combine to magnify the effects of consolidation
13.3
Subsidence in Rock Aquifers and Reservoirs
13.3.1
Extraction of Water
Rock aquifers, such as limestone and sandstone, are much stronger than uncemented
and weakly bonded sediments, such as sands and silts, and suffer very little compres-
sion from the changes in effective stress that extraction of water within them creates.
Nevertheless if the aquifer is deep enough for the loads upon it to be high compared
with its strength, it will deform when the water pressures within it are lowered. This
hardly ever causes problems of settlement at ground level because the movements are
small and their origins are at such depths that the effects of any differential move-
ments are spread over a large area by the time they reach ground level – they become
imperceptible. However, the lithologies of a sedimentary sequence can easily place a
sediment that would be described as rock against one that would not be described as
rock. A typical example of this occurs beneath London where the major confined aqui-
fer, the chalk (of Cretaceous age) is unconformably overlain and confined by the Lon-
don clay (of Tertiary age). The chalk beneath London was severely pumped for water
412 CHAPTER 13 · Ground Reaction to Changes of Fluid and Gas Pressures
supply in the 19th and early part of the 20th century, and the question whether Lon-
don is sinking as a result, has been asked. Wilson and Grace (1942) used Terzaghi’s
equations for consolidation to examine the long-term pumping and coupled subsid-
ence effects in the London Basin from 1850 to 1940. They concluded that settlement
should be expected from the consolidation of the London clay – this being a result of
the reduction of pore water pressure in the strata beneath it. They did not discuss the
possibility of the chalk compressing as the effective stresses increased but subsequent
analyses shows that the changes in effective stress would probably have been too small
to make a significant contribution to the settlement that could reasonably be expected
from the London clay alone. This is not the case in the oil fields where the levels of
stress and stress change produced by pumping can easily match the strength of the
sedimentary reservoirs from which oil and gas is being extracted causing the reser-
voir rock in the vicinity of the well to fail.
13.3.2
Extraction of Oil and Gas
Contrary to experience from the extraction of water from the chalk under London or
elsewhere on land in Great Britain, subsidence associated with the extraction of oil
and gas from the chalk of the Ekofisk reservoirs in the North Sea caused more than
3.5 m settlement. In this instance, lowering oil pressure in the chalk around the wells
increased effective stresses at depth so much the yield point of the chalk was passed,
making it highly compressible and causing it to fail. The reasons for this compress-
ibility under the change in effective stresses that were imposed on the chalk reservoir,
are complex and reflect the geological history of the ground. In studying this, Sulak
and Danielsen (1989) had to differentiate between mechanical and chemical mecha-
nisms. Mechanical compaction (in petroleum engineering language) is comparable
to consolidation: the expulsion of water under gradually increasing loads from the
accumulation of overburden sediments. Chemical compaction describes pressure so-
lution processes that continue to influence the rock when mechanical compaction is
largely complete – a process that would probably be recognised as “creep” i.e. slow and
long-term deformation under constant effective stress. To appreciate how these mecha-
nisms can operate in chalk it is necessary to understand the material as well as the
mass. The chalk is largely made from microscopic biogenic platelets of silt to clay size
particles, that are the fragmentary remains of larger rings of platelets known as
coccoliths, which are themselves broken down from planktonic unicellular algae known
as coccospheres. The platelets and less frequent coccoliths, and coccospheres, accumu-
late on the sea floor to create an open and porous delicate structure that is preserved
in an early cementation phase of sedimentation on the floor of the chalk sea; the bonds
between these particles are likened to “spot welding”. Once effective stresses increase
sufficiently, due to pumping, this light cementation breaks down and the chalk begins
to disaggregate; when this happens completely the chalk becomes a slurry, with the
consistency of toothpaste. At this point compaction is rapid and dramatic. Table 13.2
(Iingersoll and Ulstein 1987) summarizes the settlements that have taken place in major
oil fields.
The Goose Creek oil field in Texas provides another example of a subsidence bowl
(Fig. 13.8) and a typical example of seismogenic faulting associated with fluid extrac-

tion. The Goose Greek displacements were accompanied by minor seismicity within
the marginal zone of the subsidence bowl of the oil field, and characterised by high
angle normal faulting in which the interior blocks dropped down towards the centre
of the field. The faults were located along the margins of the subsidence bowl, within
the zone of radially orientated horizontal extensional strain; the maximum subsid-
ence was about 1 m.
The Wilmington oilfield in California produces oil from depths of between 600 and
2000 m and has been pumped since 1932; it has much greater subsidence than Goose
Creek. Subsidence is believed to have begun in 1937 but was first recognised by level-
ling in 1941. At its greatest point of depression the subsidence was 2.4 m in 1947, 4 m
414 CHAPTER 13 · Ground Reaction to Changes of Fluid and Gas Pressures
Fig. 13.8. Goose Creek oil field subsidence. The subsidence shown occurred in the period 1917–1925.
The ‘production limit’ encloses the producing wells during that period
in 1951, 6.1 m in 1954, 7.9 m in 1958 and 8.8 m in 1965. Because the subsidence bowl is
deep, horizontal displacements associated with the vertical movements were large,
reaching a maximum of about 3.6 m. Small earthquakes, with hypocentres at 450 to
550 m, occasionally occurred.
Although the subsidence at Wilmington is high for on-shore oil and gas fields, it
may well be exceeded by that in the Ekofisk oil and gas field, mentioned earlier. There,
subsidence, first noted as significant round about 1984, had reached 6 m in 1994 and
may reach as much as 18 m at the centre of a subsidence bowl, which itself is likely to
be about 12 km in diameter in 2028. This will bring about changes of significance to
platform foundation performance and design (Broughton et al. 1997). The practical
aspects of determining the parameters for modelling compaction are recorded in Ri-
chard Goodman’s recent biography of Karl Terzaghi (1999). Key amongst these is ei-
ther obtaining sufficient “undisturbed” samples (in this instance rock core) from depths
of over 1000 m without them being unduly influenced by considerable stress relief or
measuring stiffness in situ at those depths.
13.3.3
Extraction of Gas
The Groningen gas field was discovered in 1959 and is now known to extend over a
net thickness ranging from 70 m in the south to 200 m in the north, and covering an
area of some 900 km2. The gas reservoir belongs to the Permian Rotliegendes Forma-
tion, is confined by the salt deposits of the Permian Zechstein Formation and overlies
the Carboniferous (Fig. 13.9). Its depth of burial is approximately 2900 metres. When
the true size of the field was recognized, it was realised that subsidence would accom-

pany extraction of the gas because the total drop in reservoir pressure (when the re-
serves have been exhausted) was expected to be approximately 30×106 Nm–2.
A geological model of the entire area likely to become affected by compaction and
subsidence was designed on the basis of the available seismic stratigraphy and well
logs. Subsidence, calculated on the basis of Eq. 13.6, was presented in the form of maps
for the years 1975, 1990 and 2005, indicating maximum subsidence of 160 mm, 600 mm
and 850 mm respectively. While the development of the gas field has been somewhat
different from that anticipated at the time of making these initial estimates, those pre-
dictions now appear to be rather conservative, probably due to the difficulty of estab-
lishing representative values for compressibility. Actual maximum subsidence mea-
sured in 1990 was 180 mm. Modern calculations employ finite element techniques
(Fig. 13.9) and benefit from back calculating compressibility from known gas pres-
sure changes and measured ground movements; not surprisingly they now appear to
give reasonable forecasts when compared to measured values. A maximum subsidence
of about 360 mm is predicted for the year 2050. The reservoirs are fault bounded and
over recent years small earthquakes, of Richter magnitudes 2 to 3 and with shallow
hypocentres, have occurred. These are thought to arise from differential compaction
at fault boundaries
13.4
Reduction and Monitoring of Subsidence from Fluid Withdrawal
Subsidence can be halted and in some cases stopped by no longer reducing pore fluid
pressures. Sometimes this requires more than the cessation of pumping out because
416 CHAPTER 13 · Ground Reaction to Changes of Fluid and Gas Pressures
extraction will have created a distribution of different pore pressures through the
ground and the cessation of pumping will not stop them from eventually equalising.
Thus the areas with lowest pore pressures will be recharged from the areas of highest
pore pressures and all pore pressures in between will be affected too. In other words
consolidation will continue in those areas where pore pressures are declining. To alle-
viate this, fluid can be injected into the formation, so increasing pore pressures to-
wards their original value and decreasing effective stress levels towards their original
value.
The following conditions must be satisfied for injection fluids to decrease effective
stress levels: the formation should accept fluids into its pore spaces but its permeabil-
ity needs to be low enough for pore pressure to build up. Further, the injection of flu-
ids into the formation must be at such rates and pressures that (in conjunction with
above) the formation pore pressures are significantly increased over a wide area. Note
that the aim of injection is to restore pore pressures; it may also reverse settlement
locally and for a short time but is unlikely to permanently restore ground level – the
ground has consolidated and that is an irreversible change. Also, increasing pore pres-
sure can promote chemical effects. Cook et al. (2001) describe how increasing pore
pressure in chalk to halt pore collapse, resulted in further collapse from the change in
solubility of CaCO (from which chalk is made) under high pressures.
3
Fluid injection has been applied successfully in the Wilmington Oil field; large scale
injection was initiated in the upper four reservoirs and a response was noted almost
immediately, both in decreasing and halting subsidence; it also increased oil produc-
tion (Leps 1987). As the water injection programmes proceeded, surface uplift (called
rebound) was noted and measured over wide spread areas as the elevations of over
900 bench marks were surveyed every 3 months. As a result of injection rates as high
as 84×103 m3 per day, the rebounded area spread to over twenty or more square
kilometres between 1960 and 1967. During this period the rate of ground level lower-
ing at the centre of the subsiding area, which was about 87 mmyr–1 before injection
commenced, reduced to approximately 78 mmyr–1.
Injection methods employed 27 km north west of Wilmington, at the Inglewood Oil
field resulted in differential movements along a fault that passed beneath the embank-
ments of the Baldwin Reservoir (Jansen 1987); the embankment displaced allowing res-
ervoir water to escape and the embankment to be eroded, culminating in its failure.
13.4.1
Measuring Consolidation and Compaction
Periodic measurements of the ground surface elevation usually are the only means
for recognising and calculating the initial stages of surface subsidence. In the Nether-
lands, a country where large tracts of land surface are close to or below sea level,
changes in land elevation are closely tied to the maintenance costs of drainage sys-
tems. Parts of the Netherlands settle at rates of between 1 and 2 mm per year as a re-
sult of consolidation of the deeper Tertiary clays and sands. Such measurements, on a
yearly basis, are within the error of the survey methods especially if older data is used
and survey points are not protected from accidental movement; measurements have
to be made over a span of several years to be able to determine most settlement rates.
13.4 · Reduction and Monitoring of Subsidence from Fluid Withdrawal 417
In the northern provinces of Groningen and Friesland extraction of hydrocarbons
has accelerated settlement. Here a number of factors combine to produce the settle-
ment experienced: natural gravitational consolidation of the near surface sediments,
extraction of near surface and deeper groundwater, to suit the needs of agriculture
and water supply, local hydraulic mining of salt and extraction of hydrocarbons from
deeper reservoirs. Claims for damage resulting from land subsidence cannot be easily
resolved in the courts as proper measurements are scarce so making it impossible to
distinguishing the contribution of each of these factors. Various approaches have been
tried to resolve this problem; one uses stochastic methods based on movements at
depth to determine settlements at the surface. Another has examined sedimentation
thicknesses either side of the faults of the Roer graben in the Netherlands to deter-
mine rates of subsidence (Zijerveld et al. 1992). Others use down-hole geophysical logs
correlated with geotechnical parameters to model subsidence rates in the Cainozoic
deposits (Kooi 2000). Despite these approaches for determining subsidence the data
for use in predictions remains both inaccurate and insufficient. The following tech-
niques describe direct measurement techniques which, if installed, give by far the most
satisfactory data.
Cable Measurements
The principle is to measure the length of a cable which is held under constant tension
by means of an anchor weight at the bottom of a deep well and counterweights at the
surface (Fig. 13.10). This method was used in the San Joaquin and Santa Clara Valleys,
California during the early 1900s, where water is withdrawn from confined aquifers.
A series of holes to various depths will identify the layers that are compacting
These techniques can also be used when settlement is occurring in sediments over-
lying karstic limestone and/or mined ground and be the only means of determining
whether settlement is the result of either consolidation (which at least makes the
ground stronger) or subsidence from a collapsing void at depth (which definitely makes
the ground weaker). With the former the length of the upper holes will decrease rela-
tive to the deeper ones where as in the latter the length of the deeper holes will in-
crease relative to the shallower ones.

urements by cable and weight.

movements recorded by A, B
and C serves to identify ap-

418 CHAPTER 13 · Ground Reaction to Changes of Fluid and Gas Pressures
Collar Counting
In general, when drilling an oil or gas well, casing is installed in the hole to the depth
where the productive formation has been reached. Subsequently the annulus between
the casing and the ground is sealed with cement grout bonding the casing to the ground.
If the ground settles it drags the casing down with it, which in turn shortens due to its
elasticity. A simple method of measuring formation compaction is therefore to peri-
odically measure the vertical distance between the well casing joints; this is done us-
ing a geophysical tool which can de lowered down a well and is designed to measure
aspects of its construction, such as the condition of the casing. The shortening of the
distance between joints will give a good indication of the vertical compaction or
stretching (if the distance lengthens) in the formations around the individual wells.
Marker Bullets
In a later stage of consolidation when casing shortening exceeds the maximum elas-
tic deformation of the casing, collar movements may no longer be representative of
formation movements, and fixed points (markers) placed in the formation itself may
provide a better means of measuring compaction. This can be accomplished by mea-
suring the relative displacement of marker bullets shot into the formation at regular
distances. The bullets can be traced periodically by means of borehole logging using
a Geiger counter if they are radioactive, or some other appropriate detector.

Epilogue
So, what is engineering geology about and what does an engineering geologist do?
I hope these pages written by David Price and completed by his colleagues have
made the reader aware that geology is fundamental to engineering geology. It used to
be said, and David would say it, that “the best geologist is the one who has seen the most
rocks” and that “no one can truly think of themselves as a geologist unless they have
also visited a volcano, a glacier, and a coral reef”. That is true for the best engineering
geologist too but in addition the engineering geologist needs to have seen the most
soils and the greatest variety of tectonic, and geomorphic settings. It also helps im-
mensely to have witnessed failure of the ground, be it the natural failure of a slope as
a landslide or an avalanche, the natural failure of the crust as an earthquake, or the
failure of ground in a mine or below a foundation. However, it is the experience of
catastrophe that matures the engineering geologist; the devastation caused by a tsu-
nami, a mudflow, strong ground motion, the collapse of strata underground, the flood-
ing of mines and tunnels; the area covered by these and their speed of occurrence is
awesome and powerfully illustrates there is nothing steady state about geological pro-
cesses, not even the slow and silent contamination of groundwater. This is the real world
in which engineering geology is practiced and it requires what used to be studied under
the name of Practical Geology.
So, what should an engineering geologist be able to do?
The answer is “Practical Geology”; it is important to be able to identify the com-
mon and especially the dangerous minerals and rocks, to be able to read geological
maps and to be able to map at any scale, not only rock types but their structure too,
together with the superficial evidence of events during the Quaternary; in short, to
know how to address a volume of ground so as to reveal its relevant aspects for
geotechnical engineering. It is important to be able to keep a good field notebook, to
be able to sketch the salient features of site and landscape, and to be able to interpret
from these geological products the natural processes that formed them, for it is these
processes that the engineering geologist must reveal. Engineers analyse processes, in
particular stability, and it is here, in the description and quantification of materials
and processes, that the engineering geologist usually needs most help, in the form of
further education.
Most young geologists have received little if any proper education in mechanics and
its application, especially to the natural world, and that is where they need further train-
ing at an appropriate stage in their career. It is extremely frustrating to operate in
geotechnical engineering without having a workmanlike grasp of forces and their
moments, stress and strain, deformation and failure, failure criteria, hydraulic head
420 Epilogue
and groundwater flow. Without these, landscapes cannot be read in a meaningful way
and the products of natural processes cannot be used to quantify the process that
formed them. These are the tools which facilitate the interface between geology and
engineering, that link field to laboratory and design to analyses; they take time to as-
similate and most geologists need help to acquire them.
But will all this be relevant to the future?
Absolutely; this book describes the core of the subject. The ground will deform and
fail in the future in the same way as it has done in the past; the geological controls on
strength, deformation, conductivity and durability have been placed there by nature
and will not go away! There is no doubt that numerical modelling will change the way
geology is used in geotechnical engineering. Limit equilibrium analyses that require
propositions for relevant boundaries, material properties and mass processes, will give
way to forms of analyses that will indicate the failure and deformation to expect with
time. Far from removing the need for geology these analyses, when used properly, in-
crease the demand for good quality geology; they require information about the geo-
logical history of the site so as to set initial stresses and a basis for separating the lat-
eral and vertical variations needed to make model output equal measured ground
response. Second rate geology will be of no value to numerical modelling. Likewise,
the use of sophisticated methods for data analyses is fatally flawed if the data is not
founded on a solid understanding of basic site geology. The chemistry of the ground
will play an increasingly important role in predictive ground engineering and here a
major problem exists with no obvious solution to it at present; viz, that most geolo-
gists, chemists and engineers are unable to talk to each other in meaningful terms.
However, from the many attempts made to solve this problem, it is certain that the
solution will require geologists to have a good grasp of their subject and practical
experience in its use.
Geologists understand that the Present is the key to the Past and for engineering
geologists the past is an important key to the future; the value of case histories to pre-
dictions of likely ground response bears witness to this. David Price reminded his stu-
dents that “…there is no substitute for geological knowledge; you either acquire it be-
fore the engineering work starts or suffer the painful, and often expensive, lesson of being
taught it as the work proceeds.” It was his wish that this book would promote the former
and prevent the latter.
