A more accurate measure of earthquake activity is
provided by the amount of seismic energy released in
an earthquake; this defines its magnitude, for which the
symbol M is used. The Scale of Magnitudes due to C. F.

by Love-wave (LQ) and Rayleigh-wave (LR) ground

the periphery of the Earth; they are the slowest but have
a large amplitude and do the greatest damage at the
surface: M is calculated from their amplitude. The
vibrations are detected and recorded by a seismograph,
an instrument consisting essentially of a lightly suspended
beam which is pivoted to a frame fixed to the ground,
and which carries a heavy mass (Fig. 1.5a). Owing to the
inertia of the heavy mass a movement is imparted to the
beam when vibrations reach the instrument, and the
movement is recorded on a chart on a rotating drum
(Fig. \.5b). On this record, or seismogram, time intervals

The oldest rocks so far discovered are dated at about
3900 million years, and as rock samples from the moon
range in age from 4400 to 3200 million years, it is probable
that a primitive crust formed on Earth about 4400 to
4500 million years ago. Stony meteorites (chondrites)
which have fallen on the present surface of the Earth also
give ages of the same order. These results together suggest
an age of 4600 million years for the Earth and its moon.
The primitive crust was probably basaltic, and was
cracked and re-melted, with the separation of lighter
(granitic) fluids, which accumulated and eventually con-
tributed to the material of the continents. As the Earth's
surface continued to cool, water began to collect on the
surface to form the embryo oceans. The atmosphere that
we know was formed much later, perhaps within the last
1000 million years, when plant life had become estab-
lished and contributed oxygen to the volcanic emanations
of an earlier stage.
Modern estimates of the ages of rocks are based on
determinations made on radioactive minerals contained
in the rocks. Before these radiometric methods were de-
veloped, earlier estimates of age had been made from data Fig. 1.21 Geological time (after Harland eta/., 1982: see

an example of this relationship.
Geosyncline
A geosyncline is a large, elongate trough of subsidence.
On the subsiding floor of the trough marine sediments are
deposited over a long period, in relatively shallow water,
as the down warping of the trough proceeds. Later, much
coarser sediment derived by rapid weathering of nearby
land areas is poured into the trough. Volcanic activity
adds igneous material to the accumulation in the trough

Cenozoic fossils
Fossils within the Tertiary sediments record a great div-
ersification of life as new species developed on the isolated
continents that were drifting across the latitudes. Mam-
malian life flourished and plants and animals came to
resemble present day forms by the late Neogene (Tables
2.1 and 2.2). Some commonly found Tertiary fossils are
shown in Fig. 2.22. Microfossils of Protozoa are of special
importance because they indicate the temperature and
salinity of the water they inhabited. Remains of micro-
scopic animals can be found, in various states of preser-
vation, in all the marine sediments of the Phanerozoic

posited as loss of carbon dioxide occurs (i.e. the equation In sub-tropical climates where the gound is covered
given on p. 32 is reversible). In this way masses of stalac-
tite, hanging from the roof or coating the walls of a cave,
are formed, sometimes making slender columns where
they have become united with stalagmites which have
been slowly built up from the floor of the cave, onto
which water has dripped over a long period of time. Sheet
stalactite coats the walls of many caverns and may be
coloured by traces of iron and lead compounds.
Chemical weathering is not restricted to easily soluble
rocks but attacks all rock types. The most easily weath-
ered are limestones; of greater resistance are sandstones
and shales: igneous rocks (excluding certain volcanic
rocks that weather rapidly) and quartzites are the most
resistant. The effect of chemical weathering on these more
resistant rocks can be clearly seen where deep weathering
has occurred and a thick cover of rotted material lies
above the irregular surface which bounds the solid rocks
beneath the weathered zone. In areas of jointed igneous
rocks, such as granite, groundwater made acid during its
passage through the soil, penetrates along joints and can
reduce the granite to a crumbly, rotted condition often
many metres in depth. In parts of Australia depths of 60
to 90 metres of weathered granite have been recorded in
engineering works. On Dartmoor, England, weathered
rock up to 10 m deep has been encountered in excava-
tions, especially in the proximity of faults, sometimes
enclosing hard masses of unweathered rock (corestones).

Cleavage
Many minerals possess a tendency to split easily in certain
regular directions, and yield smooth plane surfaces called
cleavage planes when thus broken. These directions de-
pend on the arrangement of the atoms in a mineral (p. 70),
and are parallel to definite crystal faces. Perfect, good,
distinct, and imperfect are terms used to describe the
quality of mineral cleavage. Mica, for example, has a
perfect cleavage by means of which it can be split into
very thin flakes; feldspars have two sets of good cleavage
planes. Calcite has three directions of cleavage.

The separation of fragments of a particular mineral
from a sediment containing many minerals may be
achieved by placing them in a liquid solution of known
specific gravity equal to that of the mineral to be
separated. Grains of greater specific gravity than the
liquid will sink whilst those of lower specific gravity will
float. Magnetic minerals such as magnetite and ilmenite
may be separated from non-magnetic minerals, such as
cassiterite, by an electro-magnet.

(parallel to the c-axis) are found in the Hexagonal System
(Fig. AAb, beryl), and 12 pyramid faces. In Trigonal
crystals, some faces are arranged in groups of three,
equally spaced around the c-axis. This is seen, for exam-

having six equal diamond-shaped faces. Calcite also

In making a rock slice, a chip of rock (or slice cut by a

on one side and mounted on a strip of glass 75 x 25 mm
(Fig. 4.9). The specimen is cemented to the glass strip by
means of Canada balsam, a gum which sets hard after

Refraction and refractive index
A ray of light travelling through one medium is bent or
refracted'when it enters another medium of different den-
sity. Figure 4.10 shows the path of such a ray (RR), which

Light which passes through a crystal is, in general, polar-
ized. While much can be learned from a microscopic
examination of minerals in ordinary transmitted light,
polarized light enables minerals to be identified with cer-
tainty.
Double refraction

two rays, one of which is refracted more than the other.

If the angle of incidence (/) is measured for air, as is
usual, then the ratio sin //sin r is called the refractive
index, n, for the other medium, and is constant whatever

It is convenient to distinguish between minerals which are
essential constituents of the rocks in which they occur,
their presence being implied by the rock name, and others
which are accessory. The latter are commonly found in
small amount in a rock but their presence or absence does
not affect the naming of it. Secondary minerals are those
which result from the decomposition of earlier minerals,
often promoted by the action of water in some form, with
the addition or subtraction of other material, and with
the formation of mineral by-products.
Identification of minerals in hand specimen
It should be possible to identify the common rock-
forming minerals in the hand specimen with a pocket lens
where one dimension of the mineral grain is not less than
about 1 mm. With practice much smaller grains can be
determined. The most useful characteristics for this pur-
pose are: Fig. 4.21 Olivine in thin section (x 12): (a) with serpentine

derivations which refer to colour changes in

The minerals occur in some basic rocks such as norite

constituent minerals; also in some andesites, usually as
small black porphyritic crystals; and in certain
ultrabasic rocks.

Forms of silica
Silica is found uncombined with other elements in
several crystalline forms of which quartz, one of the
most common minerals in nature, is of special
importance. As the quartz content of a rock increases so
may its strength and also its abrasiveness to machinery

rich rock fine dust may be created which should not be
inhaled as it may damage lung tissue. Other forms of
silica include the high temperature tridymite (see below);
chalcedony, aggregates of quartz fibres; and the
cryptocrystalline forms flint and opal, and chert (p. 126).

Quartz is distinguished from orthoclase by the
absence of twinning and by its entire lack of alteration;
it always appears fresh, although inclusions may be
present. The mineral may show strain polarization in
rocks which have been deformed and then has no sharp

The molten material from which igneous rocks have
solidified is called magma. Natural magmas are hot, vis-
cous siliceous melts in which the chief elements present
are silicon and oxygen, and the metals potassium, sodium,
calcium, magnesium, aluminium, and iron (in the order
of their chemical activity). Together with these main con-
stituents are small amounts of many other elements, and
gases such as CO , SO , and H O. Magmas are thus

solidifies as a rock-glass, without crystals; cooled slowly,

but its nomenclature remains because the broad distinc-

its size. Large crystals are able to form and the rocks so

The Palisades Sill, New Jersey, is an olivine-dolerite (or

margins at the upper and lower contacts. The mineral
composition varies from top to bottom of the sill as a
result of the setting of early-formed heavy crystals, olivine
and pyroxene, during the slow cooling of the mass. Most
of the olivine is concentrated near the base of the sill at a
level known as the 'olivine ledge'. Crystal settling is re-

Ring structures
Ring dykes are intrusive masses filling curved fractures,
sometimes appearing as a complete circle or loop in plan.

Laccolith and phacolith
A laccolith is a small intrusion having a flat floor and
domed roof (Fig. 5.13a), the roof having been arched by
the pressure of incoming magma. Laccoliths in the Henry
Mountains, Utah, were intruded into mainly horizontal
strata and are now exposed after denudation. Others are
found in Iceland, in Skye (gabbro laccoliths), and else-
where.

The term pluton is used to denote a moderately large
body of magma which is intruded essentially at one time
and is contained within a single boundary. Plutons have

cross-section; an average area for many granitic plutons is
about 150 km2 but many are larger. Those emplaced early

Stoping
A contributory process by which magma rises into
country-rocks during a process of intrusion is known as
stoping, or magmatic stoping. The term 'stope' has long
been used in mining for the opening up of a vertical or
inclined shaft by the piecemeal removal of the rock. Stop-
ing as applied to magma was discussed by Billings (1925).

an extent of some 6000 km2 and a thickness of about
6 km. Another example is the complex layered intrusion

We can now construct the following grouping for ig-

Texture and composition
Texture
The texture, or relative size and arrangement of the com-
ponent minerals, of an igneous rock corresponds broadly
to the rock's mode of occurrence. Many descriptive terms
are used by geologists and a selection of the more com-
mon is presented in Table 5.2.

Ultrabasic rocks

These ultrabasic rocks consist mainly of mafic minerals Gabbro, dolerite, and basalt
and contain little or no feldspar. They are coarse-grained,

give the rocks a dark appearance. Specific gravity ranges
from about 2.9 to 3.2. Because basic lavas are relatively
fluid, basalt is frequently (though finely) crystalline; it
may grade into dolerite with increase of crystal size, and
similarly dolerite may grade into gabbro as the texture
grows coarser.
Gabbro
Minerals
Essential minerals are a plagioclase (generally labra-
dorite) and a monoclinic pyroxene (augite or diallage).
The plagioclase composition reflects the high CaO and
low Na O content in gabbro (see analysis, p. 100). Other
2
minerals which may be present in different gabbros are
hypersthene, olivine, hornblende, biotite, and sometimes
nepheline. Ilmenite, magnetite, and apatite are common
accessories. Quartz in very small amount may be present
in some gabbros (see below). Mafic minerals make up

is of common occurrence.
Troctolite has olivine and plagioclase (no augite).
Quartz-gabbro contains a little interstitial quartz, derived
from the last liquid to crystallize from a magma with
slightly higher silica content than normal; e.g. the Car-
rock Fell rock, Cumberland.
In Britain gabbros are found in Skye (the Cuillins),
Ardnamurchan (ring dykes), Northern Ireland (Slieve
Gullion), the Lake District, and the Lizard. The large
basic sheets of Aberdeenshire as at Insch, Haddo House,
and Huntly contain much norite and hypersthene-gab-

include those of Skaergard, Sudbury, and the Bushveld,

Texture
Coarse to medium-grained, rarely porphyritic. In hand
specimens minerals can usually be distinguished with the
aid of a lens. Under the microscope minerals show inter-
locking outlines, the mafic minerals tending to be idio-
morphic ( = exhibit a regular shape).
Varieties
Quartz-diorite (the amount of quartz is much less than
in granite) is perhaps more common than diorite as de-
fined above. Fine-grained varieties are called microdiorite.
Plag Diorites are found in relatively small masses and fre-
quently form local modifications to granodiorite and
Pyr granite intrusions; e.g. at the margins of the Newer Gran-
ites of Scotland. Small diorite masses occur at Comrie
and Garabal Hill, Perthshire.
Andesite
Andesites are fine-grained volcanic rocks, are common as
lava flows in orogenic regions and occasionally form
small intrusions. They are compact, sometimes vesicular,
often brown in colour, and in total extent are second only
to basalts. Most andesite flows are found on continental
areas, e.g. in the Andes of South America (whence the
name is taken), where many volcanoes have emitted ash
and lava of andesitic composition; also in parts of the
Cordilleras of North America. Certain ores are associated
with andesites (p. 110).

Intermediate rocks
Diorite and andesite
The intermediate rocks shown in Fig. 5.17 typically con-
tain little or no quartz. Diorite is related to granite, and
by increase of silica content and the incoming of ortho-
clase grades into the acid rocks, thus: diorite -> quartz-

microlithic texture contains many small elongated feld-
spars, or microliths, often having a sub-parallel arrange-
ment, cf. the trachytic textures, p. 108). Opaque iron ox-
ides (e.g. magnetite) are common accessories.
Hornblende may show dark borders due to reaction with
magma.
Varieties Hornblende-andesite, augite-andesite, en-
statite-andesite, biotite-andesite, and quartz-andesite
( = dacite). The pyroxene-bearing varieties are abundant
and may grade into basalts. Andesites that have been
altered by hot mineralizing waters of volcanic origin (see
Fig. 5.28a), with the production of secondary minerals,
are called propylites.
In Britain, andesite lavas of Old Red Sandstone age are
found in the Pentland Hills, Edinburgh; Glencoe and Ben

Granite is an important structural stone because of its
good appearance, hardness and resistance to weathering
(except when crystals of mica are large and weather leav-
ing voids which pit the finished surface), and its strength
in compression; the crushing strength of sound granite
ranges from about 135 x 106 to 24Ox 106 Nm"2. The
strength of the rock and its rough fracture are also valu-
able properties when it is used as concrete aggregate. The
average specific gravities are: granite, 2.67, granodiorite,
2.72.
It should be noted that in commerce the term 'granite'
is used for some rocks that are not granite in the geolog-
ical sense.

Quartz, alkali feldspar, a smaller amount of plagio-

quartz is less. As shown in Fig. 5.17 (p. 100), granodiorite
is transitional between granite and diorite; its texture is
normally coarse-grained. The name tonalite (after the
Tonali Pass, Italy) is used for similar rocks in which the
plagioclase content is more than two-thirds of the total
feldspar; and adamellite (after Mt Adamello) for those in
which the potash-feldspar and plagioclase are nearly
equal in amount.
In Scotland, the 'granites' of Caledonian age are mainly
granodiorites with tonalite or adamellite portions; the
three rock types often form successive intrusions in a
single mass, which in some cases may also have a margin
of quartz-diorite. They include the Moor of Rannoch

Nevis; the great Cairngorm intrusion (mainly adamellite),
and the Lochnagar and Hill of Fare intrusions of Aber-

Norway are attractive decorative stones that have been
used for facing slabs in buildings. In the Kola (Mur-

Hydrothermal processes
As crystallization progresses within an intrusion a resi-
dual magmatic liquid accumulates. Magmas of acid com-
position (such as granite) are frequently rich in volatile
constituents, and may also contain small quantities of
many metals. As crystallization proceeds, with the for-
mation of minerals like feldspar and quartz which form
the bulk of the resulting rock, the metals - which were
originally disseminated throughout the magma and were
not incorporated in the feldspar and other crystals -
become concentrated in the residual fluids. These also

formed by chemical deposition.
Composition
The raw materials from which the sedimentary rocks have
been formed include accumulations of loose sand and
muddy detritus, derived from the breakdown of older
rocks and brought together and sorted by water or wind,
as discussed in Chapter 3. Some sediments are formed
mainly from the remains of animals and plants that lived
in rivers, estuaries, on deltas, along coast-lines and in the
sea. Shelly and coral limestones, coal and many sedimen- Fig. 6.1 Two sedimentary rocks, in thin section, (a) Sand-

porosity (and high void ratio), represented in Fig. 6.4 by features together distinguish a rock and are known as its
fades, and from them deductions can be made about the
environment in which the rock was formed. Thus, in
marine sediments occur marine facies in which there is a
transition from pebbly and sandy material {littoral facies)
near the shore-line to a contemporaneous muddy facies in
deeper water. Sediments formed on land, such as breccias,
wind-blown sands, and wadi deposits, constitute a conti-
nental facies.
Igneous rocks erupted from volcanic vents may provide
a volcanic facies contemporaneous with sedimentation
elsewhere.
Environments of deposition
The compositions and textures of sedimentary rocks are
controlled by the processes that operated during their
formation; and these processes are in turn governed by
the environment in which sedimentation takes place.
Three major environments may be identified, namely con-
tinental, shelf sea and open or deep sea.
Continental environments
These develop on land areas where desert, piedmont,
alluvial, lacustrine and glacial deposits are accumulated.
Desert or eolian sands have been discussed earlier (p.
000). Piedmont deposits, which are formed during rapid
weathering of mountains at the end of an orogenic up-
heaval and lie at the foot of steep slopes that are under-
going denudation, include scree deposits and arkoses
(q.v.). Lacustrine clays are slowly deposited in lakes of
still water. Where water is impounded in glacial lakes,
seasonal melting of the ice leads to the formation of
varved clays with alternations of coarser (silty) and finer
(muddy) layers. Many of these environments have been
described in Chapter 3: c/. the work of rivers, wind, ice
and other mass transport.
Shelf sea environments
These exist at the margin of a sea on the continental
shelf; deposits of pebbles and sand of various grades are
formed, together with muds and calcareous material. The
rough water caused by wave action along a shore results
in the rounding of rock particles into pebbles, and the
wearing down of the larger sand grains, which are mainly
quartz. Minerals less hard than quartz do not persist for
so long, nor do minerals with cleavages (such as feld-
spars). Still finer particles of silt also consist largely of
quartz.
Structures such as current-bedding and ripple-marks
(Fig. 2.1) may be preserved in the resulting sandy and
silty rocks. Shales are formed from muds deposited in
somewhat deeper and less turbulent water at a distance

the point (a). As deposition continues, the overburden
pressure increases and the sediment compacts, e.g. to
point (b) or further to (c). The curve abc in the figure is
called the sedimentation compression curve for that par-
ticular clay. The clay is said to be normally consolidated if
it has never been under a pressure greater than the existing
overburden load. If, however, the clay has in the past
been subjected to a greater overburden pressure, due to
the deposition of more sediment which has subsequently
been eroded, it is said to be over-consolidated; this is
represented by point (d) in Fig. 6.4. Thus two clays, at
points (Z?) and (d), which are under the same effective
pressure and are identical except for their consolidation
history, have very different void ratios and packing. The
construction of curves such as those shown in the figure
has been discussed by Skempton (1970). The London
Clay is an example of an over-consolidated clay; its con-
solidation took place under the weight of the overlying
Upper Eocene beds (Fig. 2.17), the estimated load in the
central London area being about 340OkNm"2. Uplift,
and the erosion which resulted from it, reduced the
overburden to its present amount.
Similar effects to consolidation by overburden load
may be produced in individual beds of clay if, during
deposition in shallow water, they are periodically exposed
to the atmosphere and desiccate at an early stage in their
geological history. The 'ball-clays' of Devon and clays
elsewhere are thought to have been over-consolidated in
this manner (Best and Fookes, 1970).

land surface begins to emerge. Finally, if conditions are
suitable, deltaic deposits may be put down on the earlier
sediments and eolian sands accumulate on the new land
surface. The shore-line is now a distance to the right of
the column.
In mobile belts (p. 16) of orogenic zones the shelf sea
forms the margin of a geosynclinal trench (Figs. 2.3 and
2.4). During the development of a geosyncline much
sediment of various kinds and of differing grade sizes is
contributed to the deepening trough. Coarse detritus is
poured into the trough at times, contributing lenses of
deposit derived from the land margins by rapid weather-
ing, and often together with material from volcanic erup-
tions. These sediments are accumulated rapidly, without
having undergone long processes of sorting and round-
ing, and therefore have a high proportion of angular
particles. Muddy sediments built up on the slopes of the
trough are affected by slumping, and mud-flows run their
course to lower levels; when seen now as consolidated
rocks (shales) they show slump structures (Fig. 6.6).
Under such conditions greywackes are formed, i.e.
badly sorted muddy sediments with much coarse clastic
material (p. 121). With them are associated breccias, and
lenses of poorly graded conglomerates in which partly
rounded pebbles are set in a matrix of angular mineral
grains; the minerals are often of more than one variety

particles of their size. The term gravel strictly refers to a deposit of pebbles and granules, but is also used to describe a range of

Sandstones may be named according to their cement-
ing material, or after constituents other than quartz.
Siliceous sandstone, with a cement of quartz or crypto-
crystalline silica between the grains of quartz (Fig. 6.9a),
is a very hard rock because of its high content of silica,
which sometimes exceeds 90% of the whole, and is there-
fore resistant to weathering and abrasive to machines
used for excavation. The term orthoquartzite is used for
nearly pure, evenly-graded quartz-sands which have been
cemented to form a sandstone. Examples are the Stiper-
stones quartzite at the base of the Ordovician, and the
basal Cambrian quartzite of Hartshill, Warwick; both are
the beach deposits of an incoming sea.
Ferruginous sandstone is red or brown in colour, the ce-
ment of iron oxide (haematite or limonite) forming a thin
coating to the grains of quartz. Many rocks of Old Red
Sandstone age (Devonian) in Britain, and Triassic sand-
stones, have ferruginous cement. Permian sandstones

rock splits easily, and is called a flagstone (Fig. 6.11). This Many greywackes show graded-bedding (Fig. 2.1), in
which the sediment passes from coarser to finer particles
from the bottom of a bed upwards; this structure is pro-
duced by the settling of a mixture of sand and mud in
water, after movement over the sea floor as a turbidity
current; a form of slump (Fig. 6.6). (Turbidity currents
give rise to a mass of disturbed sediment which on later
consolidation forms the rocks known as turbidites.) Elon-
gated projections called flow-casts or sole-markings are
frequently found on the undersides of greywacke beds;
they show the direction of currents which operated at the
time of their formation.

structure arises when a mixture of mica and quartz grains
is gently sedimented in water; the micas settle through
still water more slowly than the quartz because of their
platy shape, and are thus separated from the quartz grains
to form a layer above them. The process may be repeated
many times if the conditions remain stable. The Moher

Though usually grey or white in colour, the rock may be
tinted, e.g. by iron compounds or finely divided carbon,
or by bitumen. Common types of limestone are now
described.
Shelly Limestone (Fig. 6.2) is a rock in which fossil shells,
such as brachipods and lamellibranchs (Fig. 2.14), form
a large part of its bulk. It may be a consolidated shell-
sand (cf. the 'crags' of East Anglia). Shell banks, in which
the shells are laid by currents and the spaces between
them filled by milky calcite (during diagenesis), are also
known as 'conquinites'.
Chalk is a soft white limestone largely made of finely-
divided calcium carbonate, much of which has been
shown to consist of minute plates, 1 or 2 /mi in diameter.
These plates are derived from the external skeletons of

abundance in different parts of the formation; and other
fossils, such as the shells of brachiopods and sea-urchins
(echinoids, Fig. 2.14). The foraminifera are minute, very
primitive jelly-like organisms (protozoa) with a hard
globular covering of carbonate of lime (Fig. 2.22); they
float at the surface of the sea during life, and then sink
and accumulate on the sea floor (p. 113). Radiolaria,
which have siliceous frameworks, often of a complicated
and beautiful pattern, are also found in Chalk but are not
so numerous as the foraminifera. Parts of the rock con-
tain about 98% CaCO and it is thus almost a pure

depths (round about 18Om) in clear water on the conti-

The importance of evaporite is obvious and many large
deposits are mined. In these excavations the original hor-
izontal bedding is often seen to have been destroyed by
faulting and folding. This mixes the layers of evaporite
(each originally of different composition) with other
strata with which they were interbedded. Evaporites can
deform as a ductile material at low temperatures and
pressures and beds of salt may flow to form salt-domes
which rise to the surface by displacing overlying strata
(see Fig. 6.21). The deformation of evaporites can cause
severe difficulties to the planning and operation of under-
ground mines.

Bedding gabbro produces an increase of temperature in the sur-
rounding rocks (or 'country-rocks'). This increase pro-
motes the recrystallization of some or all of the compo-
nents of the rocks affected, the most marked changes
occurring near the contact with the igneous body. When
recrystallization can develop uninhibited by an external
stress acting on the rocks, the new minerals grow hap-
hazardly in all directions and the metamorphosed rock
acquires a granular fabric, which is known as the hornfels

kaolinite
Parts of the Cornish granites, as at St Austell, have been
decomposed by this hydrothermal action, giving a soft
mass of quartz, kaolin, and mica which crumbles at the
touch. In the quarries the kaolinized rock is washed down
by jets of water; the milky-looking fluid is then pumped
from the sumps into which it has drained and allowed to
gravitate through a series of tanks. These remove first the
mica and quartz, and the kaolin is allowed to settle out of
suspension as a whitish sludge.
Kaolin is an important economic product, and is used
as a paper filler, and to a lesser extent in pottery manu-
facture and for numerous other purposes as an inert
absorbent.
Greisen
Composed essentially of quartz, white mica, and acces-
sory amounts of tourmaline, fluorite, and topaz, this is
formed from granite under certain pneumatolytic condi-
tions; where, for example, the formation OfK CO in the

above equation is inhibited, white mica (secondary mus-
covite) is formed from the feldspar of the granite and the
name greisen is given to the resulting rock.
China-stone
This represents an arrested stage in the kaolinization
of granite; in addition to quartz and decomposed feldspar
it frequently contains topaz (Al SiO F ) and fluorspar, 2 4 2
both of which point to incoming fluorine.
Regional metamorphism
Rocks which have undergone regional metamorphism
have a much greater extent at the surface than those
formed by contact-metamorphism and may be found ex-
posed over many hundreds of square kilometres. A sub-
stantial input of energy is required for such metamorph-
ism and occurs at the boundaries of colliding plates. Such
a boundary is shown in Fig. 1.20 and the location of
others like it, where regional metamorphism is occurring
at present, is given in Fig. 1.17. Mountains form from
these zones (Figs 2.3 and 2.4) and the deformation that
occurs within them is illustrated in Fig. 2.176.

after the main rock types produced, viz. slate, schist, and
gneiss. In the slate grade of metamorphism, low tempera-
ture and high stress differences are the controlling factors
(Fig. 7.1). In the schist grade moderate temperatures and
moderate stress operate during the metamorphism
(Fig. 7.2). And in the gneiss grade the metamorphism
involves high temperatures and low stress differences.
With the gneisses can also be included the granulites,
which have a texture of nearly equal-sized crystals.
Zones of regional metamorphism
The existence of metamorphic zones is best revealed by
the metamorphism of clayey sediments of constant bulk
composition. With a progressive increase in temperature,
zones of increasing metamorphism are defined by the
appearance of index-minerals in the rocks. Different
index-minerals come into equilibrium at successively
higher temperatures, and provide a guide to the tempera-
ture reached by the rocks containing them. Most of the
metamorphism takes place in the temperature range from
about 200Â° to 7000C.
The sequence of index-minerals in order of rising tem-
perature is: chlorite, biotite, garnet (almandine), stauro-
lite, kyanite, and sillimanite, and the minerals define a
series of metamorphic zones. In the chlorite-zone (low-
grade metamorphism) the chlorite is formed from sericite
and other minute mineral particles in the original sedi-
ment. At a somewhat higher temperature a red-brown
biotite is formed and marks the beginning of the biotite
zone. The appearance of abundant pink garnet (alman-
dine, p. 79) defines the next zone; and the rocks are now (p. 141) may be developed. Sillimanite also occurs in the

Slate
Under the influence of high stress combined with low to
moderate temperature, argillaceous sediments such as
shales are compressed and become slate. Minute crystals
of flaky minerals such as chlorite and sericite grow with
their cleavage surfaces at right angles to the direction of
maximum compression and some original minerals, e.g.
quartz grains, recrystallize with their length parallel to
this direction (Fig. 7.7). The rock thus possesses a prefer-

ential direction of splitting, or slaty cleavage (to be distin-
guished from mineral cleavage), parallel to the flat sur-
faces of the oriented crystals and independent of original
bedding (Fig. 7.1). Slaty cleavage is often very regular
and perfect, yielding smooth-sided thin plates of rock.
Fossils may be deformed by this metamorphism. The
cleavage pattern can extend over a wide area and cuts
across folds that may be present in the rocks (Fig. 7.8).
The essential minerals are chlorite, sericite and quartz.

Formed from argillaceous or pelitic sediments such as are common accessory minerals. A gneiss breaks less

The term orthogneiss is used for rocks derived from
igneous rocks such as granite by regional metamorphism;
and the name paragneiss is given to those rocks derived
from sediments.
An example of the latter is biotite-gneiss, a high grade
derivative from argillaceous rocks such as shales
(Fig. 7.9). It is composed of bands in which quartz and

Migmatite
The introduction of igneous (e.g. granitic) material into
country-rocks of various kinds produces mixed rocks or
migmatites (p. 106). In some migmatites the mixing is
mechanical, by the injection of veins or stripes; in others
the mixing is chemical, and arises from the permeation or
soaking of the country-rocks by the invading fluids
(cf. granitization, p. 108). The subject is too extensive for
further consideration here, but we may note that mig-

Folds
It is frequently seen that strata in many parts of the
Earth's crust have been bent or buckled into folds; dip-
ping beds, mentioned above, are often parts of such struc-
tures. An arched fold in which the two limbs dip away
from one another is called an antiform, or an anticline
when the rocks that form its central part or core are older
than the outer strata (Fig. 2.17a, the Wealden anticline

the limbs dip towards one another is a synform, or a

other cases forces operating radially to the Earth's surface
have caused strata to move and buckle, e.g. by downward
movement under gravity (Fig. 6.6) or upward movement
above a salt dome (Fig. 6.21). Folding involves brittle

Fold geometry
Some simple fold forms are shown in Fig. 8.6, and we
now consider their geometry. In the cross-section of an
upright fold the highest point on the anticline is the crest
and the lowest point of the syncline the trough; the length
of the fold extends parallel to the strike of the beds, i.e. in
a direction at right angles to the section.
The line along a particular bed where the curvature is
greatest is called the hinge or hinge-line of the fold
(Fig. 8.6); and the part of a folded surface between one
hinge and the next is a fold limb.
The surface which bisects the angle between the fold
limbs is the axial surface, and is defined as the locus of
the hinges of all beds forming the fold (see Fig. 8.6). This
definition allows for the curvature which is frequently
found in an axial surface (Fig. 8.7g).
The intersection of an axial surface with the surface of
the ground can be called the axial trace of the fold; in
some instances it is marked on a geological map as 'axis
of folding' (see Chapter 12).
Two other terms for describing folds, especially useful
where dissimilar rocks are involved, are core and envelope',
Fig. 8.6 shows that the core is the inner part of the fold
and the envelope the outer part.

It should be noted that when a plunging antiform is
seen intersected by a ground surface, i.e. in outcrop, the
strikes of the two limbs converge in the direction of plunge
until, at the closure of the fold, the strike is normal to the
axial trace (Fig. 8.1Oe). Examples of this are sometimes
clearly displayed on a foreshore which has been cut by
wave action across folded rocks. The representation of
such structures on geological maps often gives character-
istic outcrop shapes (Fig. 12.17).

thus formed (Figs 6.21, 8.18) is often nearly circular in
the direction of maximum principal stress. In practice this
angle is generally found to be less than 45Â°, owing to the
operation of frictional forces in the material at the
moment of failure. Thus an acute-angled cone is formed;
or, in two dimensions, two complementary shear frac-
tures intersect at an acute angle which faces the direction
of maximum compression. Many rocks when tested break
in this way, as brittle materials, with an acute angle be-
tween the shear directions which is often in the neigh-
bourhood of 67Â° (Fig. 9.17).
Tests have been made on cylinders of rock, with lateral
confining pressure as well as an axial compression. In
these tests brittle failure occurs at low confining pressures,
and ductile failure at high confining pressures; a tran-

called the throw of the fault.
Two common types of fault are illustrated in Fig. 8.20a,
which shows a normal fault on left, where a bed originally
continuous at 'a' has been broken and the side A moved
down relative to B, or B moved up relative to A. The side
B is called the 'footwalF, and A the 'hanging wall/ In a
normal fault, therefore, the hanging wall is displaced
downwards relative to the footwall. A reverse fault is
shown in Fig. 8.20&. In this case the hanging wall C is
displaced upwards relative to the footwall D. Notice that
the effect of the reverse faulting is to reduce the original
horizontal extent of the broken bed; the two displaced
ends of a stratum overlap in plan. The effect of a normal
fault is to increase the original horizontal distance be-
tween points on either side of the fracture.
The custom of describing faults as 'normal' or 'reverse'
originated in English coal-mining practice. Faults which
were inclined towards the downthrow side were met most
commonly (e.g. Fig. 6.19). When a seam which was being Fig. 8.20 Normal and reverse faults. Vertical cross-sections

Axial all kinds of rocks, have been referred to earlier in this
surface book (p. 33) and are the most common structure to affect
the behaviour of soil and rock in engineering works. The
'fissures' of many overconsolidated sediments (p. 160) are
joints. They are fractures on which there has been no
movement, or no discernible movement, of one side (or
wall) relative to the other. In this way joints differ from
faults (p. 151). Groups of parallel joints are called joint
sets, and for two or more sets which intersect the term
joint system is used.
Many joints are developed in the relief of tensional or
shearing stresses acting on a rock mass. The cause of the
stresses has been variously ascribed to shrinkage or con-
traction, compression, unequal uplift or subsidence, and
other phenomena; all are a relief of in situ stress.

Flat-lying joints (or 'L-joints') of primary origin form
a third set of fractures at right angles to the Q- and S-

34), are developed during denudation and unloading.
Some of these joints act as channels for the passage of
residual fluids, which consolidate as veins of aplite or
pegmatite; or for the passage of hot gases which affect the
walls of open joints (pneumatolysis, p. 109), or fluids
which coat them with hydro thermal minerals. All these
joints are of early origin. But many granites show other

Where shear fractures intersect at a small angle, 20Â° or
less, and one fracture is a fault, the small fractures which
lie at the acute angle with it are called pinnate or

the acute angle points away from the direction of move-

Strength of Geological Material
The strength of rock, or of less well consolidated sedi-
ment, is influenced by the mineralogy of its particles and
by the character of the particle contacts. These properties
are inherited from the processes that formed the rock, as
described in Chapters 5, 6 and 7, and modified by later
folding, faulting and jointing as explained in Chapter 8:
finally they are affected by the agents of weathering
(Chapter 3). Consequently the strength of rocks and sedi-

of these stresses influence the behaviour of the rocks when
they are sampled for testing in the laboratory and contri-
bute to their failure when the samples are loaded to de-
struction. In-situ stress of this kind may continue to relax,
C-D, even after the rock has been further unloaded by
excavation for engineering works, and can affect the sta-
bility of excavations and buildings constructed in them.
Uplift
The overburden load is progressively reduced above rocks
as they are raised towards ground level and this permits
them to expand in the vertical direction. Horizontal sets
of joints and others of sub-horizontal inclination, will
open and bedding surfaces will part (see Fig. 6.11). Figure
9.2 illustrates that uplift is also accompanied by lateral
strain which enables vertical and steeply inclined joint
sets to develop and open (Fig. 6.11). In addition to the
joints that can be seen there are many more fractures, of
microscopic size, that open in the 'solid' blocks of rock
between the visible joints.
Other microscopic changes occur: crystals and grains
begin to move apart as the rock expands, and this move-
ment disrupts the contact between them (see Fig. 6.10).
These, and similar processes, gradually convert a rock
from the unbroken character it possessed at depth, where
its crystals and grains were pressed tightly together, to the
broken and porous condition it exhibits at ground level.
Shallow burial and uplift
Many of the younger sediments that are close to the
surface of the Earth have not been buried to great depths
and are insufficiently consolidated and cemented for them
to be described as 'rock'. These are the sediments engi-
neers call 'soil'. Despite their short geological history
they exhibit the same trend in their physical character as
that described above for rock.
The variation of strength with depth measured in two
deposits of clay is illustrated in Fig. 9.6. The normally
consolidated clay has never been unloaded and is without
fissures or joints. The lateral stress at depth within this
clay is similar to that which could be calculated from a
knowledge of vertical stress, the theory of elasticity and
the use of Poisson's ratio.
The over-consolidated clay has been unloaded by ero-

The behaviour of rock and soil under load may be
observed by testing columnar specimens that are repre-

they are taken (see Chapter 11). One such specimen is

Cohesion and friction
Sediment such as clay, has an inherent strength called
cohesion that must be exceeded for a failure surface to
develop: dry uncemented sand has no such strength. The
presence of cohesion may be used to divide soils into two
classes, namely cohesive, i.e. having cohesion, and non-
cohesive. Argillaceous sediments tend to be cohesive
(Table 6.2), and arenaceous sediments tend to be non-
cohesive unless they are cemented, or contain clay, or
have been consolidated and are extremely dense.
Figure 9.16 illustrates the behaviour of a cohesive
sediment loaded to failure in three tests, each conducted at
a higher confining pressure and requiring a corresponding
increase in the vertical stress ((T) to cause failure. The

either the temperature of the specimen or the time over
which loading occurs decreases the stress required to
obtain an equivalent strain at lower temperatures using
faster rates of loading, i.e. the specimen becomes weaker.
Rocks which are brittle at ground level can behave as
ductile materials at depth.
The relationship between stress and strain to be ex-
pected in soil that is loaded and permitted to drain during
testing is shown in Fig. 9.15. Yield usually commences
soon after the application of load and failure can be either
brittle or ductile. Volumetric strain indicates the reason Axial strain

dated sediments) compress to a smaller volume as their
particles rearrange themselves during failure. The par-
ticles in dense soils (e.g. over-consolidated sediments) are Failure envelope
packed more closely together and must ride over each

As with rock, the strength of soil increases with increased

Influence of fabric
The fabric of a rock or soil is the pattern formed by the
shape, size and distribution of its crystals or sediment
particles. Many metamorphic rocks have a banded fabric
Fig. 9.18 Mohr-Coulomb failure envelope for soil. (cf Figs 7.1, 7.2, IAb, 7.9, 7.10) and most sediments
contain bedding (cf Figs 6.11, 6.13): their fabric is ani-

,tension clays are most sensitive because of their open fabric (cf
Fig 63b, c), the ratio of their undisturbed and remoulded

late Pleistocene and Recent clays in Canada and Scandi-
navia are extremely sensitive being marine clays which
have been raised above sea level by the post-glacial uplift
of the continent on which they were deposited (Fig. 2.19).
These clays rapidly lose their strength when disturbed
and are aptly described as 'quick' clay (p. 122). Clays
having a dispersed but layered structure (Fig. 63d) and
those which have been consolidated (Fig. 6.13) are less
sensitive. The sensitivity of normally consolidated clays

Influence of water
The strength of a crystal lattice and the energy required
to propagate through it a crack is reduced by contact with
water, and the presence of water in the pores and fractures
of soil and rock lessens the bonds that provide cohesion.
Further, the pressure of water within the voids of soil and
rock controls the effective stress upon their crystals and
particles and the frictional resistance they are able to
generate at their points of contact. For these reasons
water weakens rock and soil whose strength when satu-
rated is usually less than that when dry.
Drained and undrained strength
The behaviour described so far for rock and soil (Figs
9.18,9.19) assumed that pore pressures developed during
loading may drain and so dissipate: such tests are called
drained tests and the strengths obtained are drained
strengths. Silt, sand, gravel, and other sediments and
sedimentary rocks of similar permeability to them, nor-
mally exhibit drained strengths when loaded in-situ by
engineering work. The strength of rock and soil whose
permeability prevents the rapid drainage of water in their
voids, will be reduced by any increase in the pressure of
water that develops within them when loaded. Experi-
ments in which drainage is prevented are called undrained
tests and the strengths obtained are undrained strengths.
Clay, shale and many rocks of low permeability such as
unweathered igneous and metamorphic rocks, and sedi-
mentary rocks whose pores are blocked by minerals and
mineral cement, are examples of geological material that
will normally exhibit undrained strength when initially
loaded in-situ by engineering work.
Figure 9.20 illustrates the remarkable influence lack of
drainage may have upon the behaviour of rock. When
pore pressure is zero and effective stress (a â u) is high,
the rock is ductile. When pore pressure is not permitted
to dissipate fully and is maintained at the same pressure
as the confining stress (a ) the rock is brittle, and much
3
weaker.
Figure 9.21 illustrates another effect produced by lack
of drainage, this time upon the strength of soil. The results
of three tests are shown, conducted upon saturated speci-
mens sealed within a membrane as in Fig. 9.11. When

uct of cohesion and described as the undrained shear

Pore pressure changes
A change in the load applied to a soil or rock produces a
change of pore pressure within it whose magnitude may
be predicted with the aid of two empirical measurements
known as the pore-pressure parameters A and B.
Parameter B describes the change in pore pressure pro-
duced in an undrained specimen by a change in all round
stress (Aa = Aa = Aa ). Thus, change in pore pres-
1 2 3
sure = B (change in all round stress). In saturated soil and
saturated compressible rock (e.g. Fig. 6.10) B = 1.0. When
voids are partially filled with air, as occurs in strata above
the zone of saturation, B is less than 1.0. The fabric of
strong rock (e.g. Figs 5.20, 5.24) has a low compressibility
and offers resistance to changes in all round stress: B is
often less than 1.0 in such rock.
Axial strain Parameter A describes the change in pore pressure
produced by a change in deviator stress (C -(T ), and is

Elastic moduli
Values of Young's Modulus and Poisson's ratio may be
obtained for rock and soil with comparative ease, but the
significance of the values obtained must be considered
with care as they may vary with time from those applic-
able to undrained conditions to those for drained condi-
tions. This is especially important for soils, where these
moduli should be determined experimentally using con-
ditions that simulate the range of stresses and type of
deformation that are expected to operate in the ground
during the engineering works.
Behaviour of surfaces
Over-consolidated sediments and all rocks that have ex-
perienced unloading and uplift (p. 160) contain micro-
fractures and other failure surfaces such as joints and
fissures: many bedding planes will have separated, some
containing a visible parting. Such surfaces have a strength
that is less than that of the rock or soil in which they
occur and they are a major source of weakness: they have
formed by failure either in tension or in shear.

occurs through the rock rather than along the joint sur-
face: when this process dominates the failure envelope

The strength of a surface reduces to its ultimate value
once displacement has removed the influence of rough-
ness.
Variation in the irregularity of a rough surface is
usually greater than that which can be sampled for testing
in the laboratory and methods for assessing the likely
peak shear strength of a rough surface have been pro-
posed by Barton and Choubey (1977).
Lessons from failure
In-situ failure as occurs in landslides on slopes that are
too steep, or in foundations that are overloaded, or in
excavations that are inadequately supported, provides an
opportunity for studying the in-situ strength possessed by
large volumes of rock and soil. The lessons learnt from
such studies are most relevant to successful geotechnical
engineering (Mitchell, 1986) and indicate the validity of
values for strength and deformation measured from small
samples tested in the laboratory (Chapter 11) and from
slightly larger volumes tested in-situ during ground inves-
tigation (Chapter 10).

The size of the test having been decided, its orientation
in relation to the engineering structure should then be
considered. Most rock masses are anisotropic and their
performance will vary according to the direction in which
they are tested. This is most marked when the anisotropy
is regular, as in a well-bedded or cleaved rock mass. It is
usual to apply loads, promote drainage or initiate dis-
placements in the direction which the proposed structure
is likely to load, drain, or displace the ground. Finally it
should be remembered that tests are best conducted in
ground that has not been disturbed.

Other uses
The geophysical techniques employed to measure dy-
namic moduli are similar to those needed in certain fields
such as blast control and earthquake engineering, where
it is necessary to know the speed with which shock waves
are propagated through the ground, and the extent to
which they will be attenuated. Seismic techniques can be
employed to investigate this, and such work is normally
conducted by geophysicists. A source of waves is pro-
vided at a point on or in the ground by a mechanical
device such as a hammer or a vibrator, or by an explosion.
Geophones are placed at intervals from this source and
record the arrival of waves so produced. For an intro-
duction to the subject see Ambraseys and Hendron
(1968); and for a fuller coverage Clarke (1970).

Rock has no classification equivalent to that for soil.
Bedding, faulting and jointing in rock create surfaces
about which the rock may separate and these have a
considerable influence upon its behaviour. For example,
open fractures can turn an impermeable shale into an
aquifer and a strong granite into a compressible bedrock.

Measurement of dip and strike
The true dip of a surface is its maximum angle of incli-
nation from the horizontal. This angle lies in the direction
of greatest gradient and dips in any other direction are
called apparent dips (Fig. 12.10).

Dip
Dip is measured with a clinometer (Fig. 12.8), and read
to 1Â° only (West, 1979). The direction of dip is recorded
as a compass bearing, e.g. a surface dipping at 60Â° to the
NW, would be recorded in the note book as a dip of 60Â°
at N 315Â° and shown on the map as an arrow pointing in
the direction 315Â° from North, and having the angle 60Â°
written next to it, as in Fig. 12.1. The true dip of a surface

because the angle and direction of true dip can be calcu-
lated from two apparent dips.

The true dip, or inclination of CC to the horizontal, is
conveniently found by making a two-dimensional plan,

field data using the following steps:
1 Draw a line to represent the direction of magnetic

2 Select a point on this line to represent C.

This graphical method is usually referred to as the
cotangent construction, and it can be used to interpret
the inclined surfaces exposed in trial pits, tenches, adits,
and similar excavations. Other methods are described by
Phillips (1971).
Strike
The strike of a surface is the direction of a horizontal line
drawn at 90Â° to the direction of true dip. The direction
N 120Â° (or N 300Â°) is the strike of the surface shown in
Fig. 12.10 as is the direction of the line AE in Fig. 12.126.
Because of its horizontality a line drawn in the direction
of strike is equivalent to an elevation contour for the
surface. Figure 12.13 illustrates how the strike directions
of a planar surface can be extended to produce strike lines
which are also contours for the surface and are called
structural contours. However, the majority of geological
surfaces are not planar and the unlimited extension of

A typical vertical section is illustrated in Fig. 12.166. In
these sections it is customary to write the vertical thick-
ness of the strata on one side of the column and the depth
below ground level on the other. The positions of rec-
ognizable unconformities (e.g. as shown in Fig. 2.2) are
usually emphasized by wavy lines.
The relative ages of strata may also be deduced directly
from the map by applying the principle of superposition
(see Chapter 2). Younger strata will always rest on older
strata unless the succession of strata has been inverted by
folding. Similarly strata intersected by faults and dykes
must be older than these structures: examples of this are
shown in Fig. 12.17 where the sequence of events recorded
is as follows:
1 Deposition of succession from dolomite (oldest) to tuff.
2 Folding of strata, faulting (Fault 2) and dyke intrusion.

(Hi) the dip of strata, and (iv) faults. Many geological surfaces are inclined; the boundary
shown dipping at 40Â° in Fig. 12.14 is typical. The outcrop
pattern of this boundary, as it crosses the valleys, points
in the direction of dip. (Check this by looking at the strike
line values and the direction of dip as shown by the dip
arrow.) This V-ing is characteristic of the outcrop of
inclined surfaces intersecting topographic depressions.
Fault 2 in Fig. 12.17, is another example. Inclined sur-
faces and the direction of their inclination can thus be
readily seen.
Observations of this kind form the basis for any inter-
pretation of geological structure because once the dip
directions are known it is possible to suggest structures
that will account for them. For example, at C in Fig.
12.17 the dip of the northern outcrop of sandstone is
towards the south, whereas at Z), it is to the north. This
sandstone outcrop is part of an east-west trending syn-
form. Similarly the boundary to the outcrop of shale dips

crop on the fold limbs. The width of the sandstone out-
crop on the limbs of the synform in Fig. 12.17 is fairly
constant and it follows that if the sandstone has a uniform
stratigraphic thickness the synform must be upright and
nearly symmetrical. In contrast, the outcrop of the sand-
stone on the southern limb of the antiform is considerably
wider than on its northern limb, suggesting that the fold
is asymmetrical and that its axial surface dips towards the
south.
This is a simple and quick way of assessing the fold
structures of an area, but there are two possible sources
of error, namely excessive variations in topography and
stratigraphical thickness.
Considering topography, it is evident from Fig. 12.1%
that the outcrop of strata of uniform stratigraphical
thickness and dip can vary as a function of the shape of
the ground surface. Care should therefore be taken when
considering the outcrop of geological units whose strati-
graphic thickness is appreciably smaller than the varia-
tions of topography. Compare this situation with that of
the limestone shown in Fig. 12.19a. Here the stratigraphi-
cal thickness of the limestone is larger than the variation
of the topography on its outcrop and outcrop widths (a)
and (b) can be used as an indication of relative dips.
The sandstone horizon in Fig. 12.19a illustrates the effect
of variations in stratigraphic thickness. Here the greater

Maps of resources
These show the distribution of particular minerals, rocks
and soils: maps of oil and gas reservoirs and of ground-
water supplies are also maps of resources. The earliest
example of such a map is that published in 1815 by the
engineer and surveyor, William Smith. Smith was com-
missioned to construct canals in England and to seal these

Derived maps
Plateau Scarp
The development of these maps has been largely inspired
by engineering for military purposes. When assessing the Ravine
strategic and tactical qualities of an area it is necessary to
know the response of the ground to vehicle loads, exca-
vation, bombardment and so forth. These, and other Slide
qualities, must be derived from a knowledge of the ori-
ginal attributes of the ground, e.g. its strength and perme-
ability. Figure 12.22 illustrates how maps of such derived
attributes are compiled.
In this example a map is required that delineates wet

where water covers its base. This is the water table and
the pressure of pore water at this level is atmospheric: the
moisture potential of the ground is zero (Fig. 13.2). The

capillary fringe. The mechanisms involved in percolation
are reviewed by Wellings and Bell (1982). A water table

The height to which the capillary fringe rises above the

Geological boundaries tend not to change with time,

usually fluctuate in elevation and are dynamic. The spring

Fig. 13.15 shows that non-steady flow is the normal flow
of natural systems. Only when the rate of change of

Transmission
The discharge of ground-water Q (dimensions L3T"1)
through the aquifer illustrated in Fig. 13.17, of area A
(dimensions L2) at 90Â° to the direction of flow, is given by
the relationship:
Q = KfA
where Ah[L is the loss in total head per unit length of flow
(i.e. the hydraulic gradient: dimensionless LL"l) and K,
called the coefficient of permeability, is the empirically-
derived quantity that equates the hydraulic gradient to
the discharge per unit area Q/A. Permeability thus has
the dimensions of velocity (i.e. LT"l).

Transmissivity
Water-supply engineers commonly combine the overall
value of in-situ permeability of strata (K) with its satu-
rated thickness (b: dimensions L) to produce a value
called transmissivity = Kb (dimensions L2T"1). As water
levels rise and fall so the value for saturated thickness (b)

In-situ stresses
The stresses within a slope are generated by its self-
weight, the presence and movement of ground-water, and
the geological history of the rock or soil from which the
slope is composed: occasionally a slope may also be
stressed by accelerations produced from earthquakes.
Stresses produced by the geological history of a rock
or soil (p. 159) are embodied in the materials themselves,
remaining there after the stimulus which generated them

The river Vajont flows in a steep gorge which cuts
through the Alpine folds of north Italy. The broad struc-
ture of the valley is a syncline, thought to have been
formed in Tertiary times (Fig. 14.14a). The rocks involved
in the folding are essentially calcareous sediments of Jur-
assic and Cretaceous age: folding mobilized the shear
strength of the weaker clay seams, so that they were at
their residual strength when folding ended (see Fig. 8.14).
Pleistocene glaciation removed a considerable volume
of rock and scoured out the glacial valley along the axis
of the syncline (Fig. 14.146). This unloading of the valley
sides promoted the development of stress relief features
parallel to the valley itself; in some places new joints were
developed, in others conveniently oriented bedding sur-
faces were opened. Landslides occurred and may have
dammed the valley until they were overtopped and eroded
away. One slide had actually crossed the valley and its
leading edge lay on the glacial sands and gravels which
locally cap the bedrock. By the time the glaciers had
retreated the valley was sufficiently elevated above sea
level for its rivert o cut a gorge some 195 m to 300 m deep
in the valley floor.
A hydro-electric scheme for the valley had been
planned, and by September 1961 a thin arch concrete
dam was constructed. Geological investigations of the
valley sides (as distinct from the dam foundations) had
been in progress at intervals since 1928 but were intensi-
fied in October 1960, when accelerated movement into
the reservoir area occurred on the south slope of the
valley within 390 m of the dam. The movement was
accompanied by a large M-shaped tension gash which
extended along the south slope (Fig. 14.14c 'I960 scar'):
approximately 200 x 106 m3 of rock and was moving on
a zone of sliding-surfaces situated about 198 m below
ground level (Fig. 14.14a). The front of the slide moved
at 8-10 cm per day and the remainder at 3-5 cm per day:
the movement as a whole suggested that progressive fail-
ure and creep were occurring.
The volume of the moving mass precluded all remedial
measures other than those which would reduce the pres-

Sediment will also accumulate as deltas at the margins
of a reservoir, where rivers discharge into the lake (Fig.

action of waves, generated by wind blowing across the
lake. These waves erode the topsoil and underlying profile
of superficial deposits, and weathered rock. This erosion
contributes sediment to the reservoir.
The rate of denudation within catchments may be cal-

tain between the caverns a head that exceeds the head in
the caverns (see Fig. 15.19).
Refrigerated chamber
Permeable and impermeable chambers are excellent for
storing oil, but difficulties arise when they are used for
storing gas. If the temperature of the gas is either at or
above 00C the product must be stored at a depth where
its vapour pressure is exceeded by either the strata pres-
sure or the pressure of ground-water. With permeable
chambers a downward flow of ground-water into the
store is also required to prevent the upward migration of
gas bubbles. These problems are greatly reduced by low-
ering the temperature of the gas so that it can be stored as
a liquid at atmospheric pressure. Such low temperatures
freeze the surrounding ground and form a refrigerated
chamber.
Rock shrinks when it cools. Existing fractures open
and new fractures are created as the rock fails in tension
under the thermally-induced stresses within it. Unlined
refrigerated chambers are therefore rarely impermeable
at very low temperatures. Liquid petroleum gas (LPG)
can be successfully stored at temperatures as low as
â400C, but liquefied natural gas (LNG), which contains
methane, requires temperatures as low as â 1000C and

ground and thus the flow of water to the excavation. The
method is illustrated in Fig. 16.9 and is only successful if
the geology of the ground above the tunnel and exposed

permeability of most soils and rocks with respect to air is
approximately 70 times their permeability with respect to
water. Considerable caution is required to ensure that a
tunnel to be driven beneath a river does not unexpectedly
break into coarse and permeable deposits of a buried
valley (q.v.) as these materials will also allow air to escape,
and its pressure to suddenly drop. Water then floods the
tunnel and, depending on the air pressure used, some of

decompression.

Deformation and failure
Ground pressures will usually change the shape of an
excavation and if deformation is excessive the slope, or
floor, of the excavation can fail (Brawner, 1982). An
indication of the ground response to be expected is pro-
vided by the structure of valleys, for these are the natural
excavations produced by the work of rivers and ice. The
deformation that can accompany valley erosion is shown
in Fig. 14.10, and such a response is seen at a preliminary
stage in recently glaciated valleys (Fig. 16.12).
Natural excavations therefore indicate that the slopes Fig. 16.13 Displacement of excavation boundaries (from

strong rock can fail at moderate depths if loaded in this

hydroelectric schemes, can be expected to encounter high

Snowy Mountains Scheme in S.E. Australia, ratios of
horizontal to vertical in-situ stress of 1.2, 1.3 and 2.6 were
recorded, with the horizontal stresses being considerably
greater than that due to the weight of overlying rock

their delicate porous network. There is a limit to the size

of pore that can be invaded by suspensions of cement and
clay, and silts are usually beyond this limit: in these sedi-

and gravel, interbedded with silt and clay, can be ex-
tremely difficult sequences to treat. If excessive injection
pressures are used in areas where the pore size of the
strata is small, the ground around the hole will fracture

will fracture the material, as it is weak. This process
(termed 'claquage') can cause the ground to be veined by
a network of grout filled fractures that collectively reduce

pressures can sometimes increase the permeability of
weak rock by creating too many ungrouted micro-frac-
tures.
Fractured strong rock
Ground containing non-porous, fractured strong rock is
normally the easiest of all types to grout. Rocks contain-
ing sets of large fractures and many smaller fractures, are
more difficult to treat. Significant reductions in perme-
ability can be achieved in these rocks by grouting only the
sets of large fractures, if by doing so the network of
smaller fractures is divided into isolated blocks, each of
which is bounded by a grouted fracture (Fig. 17.8). Grout
would have to penetrate the network of small fissures if
the deformability of the ground had to be improved.
Clay-filled fractures will not accept grout and must be
flushed with water until all erodable infilling is removed
(see Lane, 1963; and Cambambe Dam, p. 249).
Fig. 17.8 The interruption of water flow through small frac-
tures by grout injected into large fractures that are more easily

Investigations
Attention should be given to the character of the voids to
be filled and the geological structure of the ground to be
treated, prior to the design and commencement of a pro-
gramme of grouting. Rarely is it possible to predict with
any certainty the volume of grout that rocks and soils will
accept, but indications of likely quantities can be gained
by observing the following geological characters.
(0 The amount of water that can be discharged into the
ground from a bore-hole. In soils an in-situ test of perme-
ability will often provide the necessary indication, but in
rocks a special test may be used which measures the
volume of water absorbed per metre length of hole and
describes the result in units of Lugeon: 1 Lugeon is
approximately equivalent to a permeability of 1.0 x 10~5
cm s-1. The variety of responses that can be obtained
from such a test are illustrated in Fig. 17.9 and discussed
by Houlsby (1976). Injection creates a hydraulic gradient
that radiates from the hole and increases with increasing
pressure of injection. Fractured rock may respond to this
by permitting flow which behaves as if laminar conditions

operate (Fig. 17.9a); in others, it appears that turbulent
conditions develop with increasing pressure (b). When
pressures are too great, the rock fractures are forced apart
and the ground dilates (c). Weak material, infilling frac-
tures, may be eroded when the velocity of flow reaches a
certain value, so that the ground becomes more per-
meable than it was originally (d). Movement of erodable
material may block pores and fractures, sealing the
ground and making it difficult to permeate (e).
(ii) The amount of water drained from a hole: this is used
in underground excavations to assess the presence of
voids in need of treatment.
(Hi) The ratio between the seismic velocity of the rock
in-situ and of the intact material as measured on a sample
of the rock tested in the laboratory. This ratio reflects the
openness of the rock mass and has been used effectively

(iv) The length of core recovered from drill holes, ex-
pressed as a percentage of the length of hole drilled, the
RQD of the core and a log of its fractures (see Chapter
10).
Other features to note are the presence of large voids
such as solution cavities, lava tunnels (and underground
workings), that may require more than normal treatment
(Khan et ai, 1970), and ground strain that may have
opened joint sets; e.g. at the crest of a slope or above
mined areas. Many of the uncertainties associated with
predicting the response of rocks and soils to grouting,
especially with foreseeing the pressures that may be used,
can be removed by conducting a grout test (Little et al.,
1963).
Ground-water The natural rate of ground-water flow
should be studied as this may be sufficient to transport
unset grout away from areas of treatment. Zones of high
velocity flow may need special attention. The chemistry
of ground-water is also relevant as it affects the type of
grout that may be used, its viscosity and its setting time
(Glossop, 1960). The properties of many chemical grouts
are particularly sensitive to the quality of the ground-
water with which they mix.
Consolidation
This form of treatment is appropriate for strengthening
soft to firm lightly consolidated sediments and for reduc-
ing the settlement that will occur within them, when later
loaded by an engineering structure. The treatment of
these sediments seeks to continue the consolidation that
occurred during their deposition. At that time, the par-
ticles of sediment were progressively loaded by the weight
of grains settling above them and moved closer together,
provided water could escape from the intervening pore

undisturbed sample of sediment is placed into an oed-
ometer (p. 192), loaded (see A in Fig. 17.12) and permitted
to consolidate (a-b), and then loaded again, in increments
(B, C, E, F) until the required magnitude of effective
stress within it has been attained. Initial consolidation is
usually non-linear (a-b-c in 17.12a). The reason for this
can be explained by observing the behaviour of the sam-
ple when it is unloaded (d-e): it expands, but does not
recover all the deformation it has sustained. Reloading
(e-f) returns the behaviour of the sample to the original
(virgin) curve. Hence the similar behaviour seen at (a-b-
c) may be taken to represent the return of the sample to
its virgin curve; i.e. it is a record of previous unloading.
The load represented by position b' is called the pre-
consolidation load to signify that a continuation of the
gravitational consolidation started by nature will only
occur once this magnitude of effective stress has been
exceeded.
To extend this behaviour to field practice, it is necessary
to increase the effective stress within a sedimentary de-
posit to a value that is greater than the pre-consolidation
load of the succession to promote a continuation of its
consolidation. This can be achieved by draining pore
water from the strata; a process that may take many
months to produce a widespread reduction in pore water
pressures, particularly in successions containing strata of
low permeability, such as clay. Consolidation can be ac-
celerated by loading the sediment with a surcharge placed
at ground level (for example, by building an embank-
ment, or stockpile above the area to be consolidated).
Vertical drains, as shown in Fig. 17.3, greatly assist the
drainage of water from horizontally-stratified successions
of sediment.
Shallow water sediments
Many of the deposits which are suitable for ground treat-
ment by consolidation, accumulated under shallow water

alluvial, estuarine and deltaic environments (Chapter 3),
and contain lateral and vertical variations of sediment
type (facies). Lenses of gravel can be interbedded with
clay and peat. The time required for a suitable amount of
consolidation to occur in these variable deposits can only
be assessed when the stratigraphy of the succession is
accurately known. Sediments most susceptible to im-
provement will have a moisture content that is between
the Liquid and Plastic Limit for the material (Fig. 9.22):
strata with a moisture content that is less than that for its
Plastic Limit, are unlikely to be much improved by this
form of treatment. Undisturbed samples of the compres-
sible layers should therefore be obtained and if the bore-
holes, from which these samples are taken, are later
logged using geophysical methods, it is possible to gain
an accurate record of the stratigraphy on site.
Peat Special care should be taken to identify deposits
of peat and similar organic material because they are
normally the most compressible of all the strata. Organic
deposits, by reason of their fibrous structure, have non-
linear consolidation characters, the general character of
which is illustrated in Fig. 17.13. The first phase of con-
solidation is controlled by the network of plant fibres, but
as time progresses, water within the fibres begins to be
expelled, giving the material a marked phase of secondary
consolidation (Berry, 1983).

deposits are described as 'collapsing soils' and are treated
by inundating them with water (Fig. 17.14).
Sandy sediments
The configuration of particles of sediment within a com-
pressible deposit, such as a lightly-consolidated clay, is
unstable (see Fig. 6.3 a-d)\ hence the deposit compresses
when the magnitude of effective stress within it is changed.
The packing of particles in sands and sandy sediments is
much more stable (Fig. 6.8). Such deposits are not easily
consolidated by inducing a drainage of their pore water,
especially if they exist above the water table. Methods for
compacting these materials use dynamic forces. They im-
part energy to the ground by dropping a weight onto its
surface (tamping), or by penetrating the thickness of the
deposit to be treated, with a large diameter vibrating
poker, often aided in its penetration by simultaneously
jetting water into the ground (vibroflotation) (see Charles
et a!., 1982; Institution of Civil Engineers, 1976).

constant level of effective stress. The mechanisms responsible
for primary and secondary consolidation, overlap, with pri-
mary consolidation dominating the initial response to load.

Sub-aerial sediments
Not all compressible weak sediments accumulated under

Volumetric changes
Sediments exhibit approximately 9% expansion when ar-
tificially frozen and sometimes heave can be observed in
Coarse granular treated ground. (Much greater expansion can occur when
sediment: sand, ice lenses form and separate bedding. This is a common
gravel etc feature of naturally-frozen ground: see Fig. 3.6). As tem-
peratures continue to drop, volumetric contraction de-
velops. Sediments shrink and form vertical columns,
often polygonal in cross section, separated from each
other by fine cracks. On thawing, these vertical cracks do
not properly heal and the vertical permeability of sedi-
ments is often found to have increased from its original
value (Chamberlain and Gow, 1978). Rocks may fracture
under the tensile stresses induced by contraction and it is
often discovered that their in-situ permeability has been
increased by ground freezing.
Investigations
The presence and movement of ground-water is of great-
est importance to the efficiency of artificial ground freez-
ing and should be investigated. Ground-water provides a
positive heat flux and flow rates exceeding 2.0 m day-1
can swamp the negative heat flux from the freezing tubes.
Under these conditions ground-water may not freeze.
The chemistry of ground-water is also relevant (p. 215)
as high salinities act as an antifreeze, but this rarely
creates a serious problem. Sea-water freezes at 3Â°C below

Other forms of support may be used in conjunction

Retaining walls
It is not possible to excavate stable vertical slopes in
sediments and weak rock. When such a profile is required,
it is customary to form a retaining wall in-situ, prior to
excavation, so that excavation can take place against this
boundary without causing the ground behind to become
unstable. The wall is normally built by driving a line of

Sho terete is a form of concrete that can be sprayed
onto the face of an excavation where it builds up to form
a lining, usually a few centimetres thick. It may be mixed
with fibres of metal or glass and thereby reinforced. The
method was developed in continental Europe and is the
basis of an excavation system described as the New Aus-
trian Tunnelling Method (or NATM). The speed and ease
with which shotcrete can be applied enables the surface
of an excavation to be protected and supported almost as
soon as it is exposed, if this is required. Such action
greatly reduces the deterioration that can rapidly occur
in weak and variable ground (see Fig. 17.18). Conse-
quently, large excavations have been opened in moder-
ately weak rock, using shotcrete linings (John, 1981).

fers will become badly contaminated.
Spring supplies
Supplies of ground-water may easily be obtained when
the level of the water table is sufficiently close to ground
level to have created a spring line (Fig 13.11). Shallow
pits excavated below the spring line will fill with water
and act as a cistern from which supplies can be tapped.
The concentrated and local discharge of ground-water
below the spring line, produces a spring. Springs may
occur at the heads of valleys where they result from the
convergence of ground-water flow paths (Fig 13.23).
Many dykes and vertical faults are hydrogeological boun-
daries (q.v.) and deflect ground-water along their length
towards their valley-side exposure, where it emerges as a
spring. Volcanic rocks (especially large flows of basalt,
much jointed by cooling) and limestones (especially when
karstic: Fig 3.2 and 3.3) are capable of providing substan- Shaft Tunnel

wet weather and decrease in dry weather, and will cease
when the water table falls below ground level.

level around the well.
Well tests determine the drawdown that accompanies a
rate of discharge and period of pumping. Important wells
are often tested for many weeks. In areas where a large
fluctuation in water level is expected it may be necessary
to test either for months, or at intervals at different sea-
sons. The transmissivity and storage of many aquifers de-
creases with depth, so that a shallow cone of depression
may accompany a test when water levels are high. When
water levels are low, and the well must be supplied from
zones of low transmissivity and storage, the cone of de-
pression becomes steep and narrow, and the well may be
pumped dry. Well tests also permit the quality of the
water to be monitored for any deterioration in standard

centration of alumina within the weathering profile, to
produce a bauxitic soil. When the water table falls, iron
becomes oxidized and fixed as haematite or geothite.
Low effort
Fluctuations in the water table cause this deposit to
gradually accumulate forming either a honeycombed and
cemented mass of laterite or layers of cemented nodules
known as laterite gravel.
Lateritic soils form a valuable source of construction
material that is extensively used in tropical countries. The
properties of the soils which are not self-hardening can
be improved, if inadequate, by mixing into them additives
such as lime (a process called soil stabilization and suitable
for use with many types of soil: Ingles and Metcalf, 1972).
Some materials (for which the word laterite was originally
used: p. 38) can be cut into bricks and other shapes, which
irreversibly harden on drying in the air. Laterites possess-
ing this property are now called plinthites, to distinguish
them from other lateritic materials. Cemented laterite
(e.g. laterite gravel) is frequently used as an unbound
aggregate for road construction.
Dimension stone
Strong, durable stone, cut to size and used as slabs, blocks
and columns, has been a building material for a greater
period than has concrete, and where the rock has been
correctly selected it has stood the test of time. The use of
dimension stone has now been superseded by concrete,
although it continues to be employed for facing and other
ornamental work, and for providing resistance to abra-

Residual soils (p. 1) will not have been subject to the
mechanical sorting that occurs when a sediment is trans-
ported by wind and by water. Consequently, residual soils
may contain a great variety of weathering products some
of which can have unusual properties.
At the Sasumua Dam site, in Kenya, lavas and tuffs

with the chemistry of the dispersing agent used in prepar-

At such depths, flows, if any, would be of a regional
nature and extremely slow (Fig. 13.3) and the waste would
be isolated from local flows that sustain water supplies.
Deep injection wells are used for this purpose.
One such well was sunk at Denver, Colorado: it was
3658 m deep and injected waste into rocks of Precambrian
age at a depth of 3642 m. The waste was mainly a concen-
trated solution of NaCl, having an average pH of 8.5.
Injection commenced in 1962 and was accompanied by a
spate of small earth tremors (Fig. 18.13): none had been
reported from the region before. Injection continued,

in 1966 but the tremors continued for three more years

High pressure recharge wells often generate ground

to injection causing movement on a pre-existing fault.
The reservoir ruptured and water destroyed 277 homes in
Baldwin Hills (Hamilton and Mechan, 1971; and Castle

Nuclear waste
Radioactive waste may be divided into low, intermediate
and high level categories on the basis of its level of ac-
tivity. Low and intermediate wastes are mainly composed

SI Units
The International System of Units has seven standards of Mass density In SI units, mass density is quoted in

Length
The SI standard of time is the second (s): dimensions [T].
The standard of length is a metre (m): dimensions [L].
Note that 1 hour = 3600 s, 1 day = 86400 s.
The following submultiple or multiple may be used:
