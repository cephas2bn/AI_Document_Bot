Electives
Students are responsible for selecting their own combination of electives, in keeping with their ultimate career objectives after graduation. The combination must satisfy the requirements of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE). This includes having to meet minimum requirements in mathematics, natural sciences, engineering sciences, engineering design, and complementary studies.
Exceptions to the electives and requirements listed in the following sections (and links) require approval of the Geological Engineering director, or Civil and Environmental Engineering associate chair, undergraduate studies. Some courses of interest may require prerequisite knowledge that is not part of the core curriculum in Geological Engineering. Students may require extra courses or may need to seek enrolment approval from the course instructor if the prerequisites have not been satisfied.
Complementary Studies Electives
Students are required to complete three Complementary Studies Electives (CSEs) from the Complementary Studies Course Lists for Engineering:

One course from List A
One course from List C 
One course from List A, C, or D

Technical Electives
Students are required to complete six technical electives (TEs) by choosing from the lists provided below. Note that the offering of these courses is contingent upon sufficient demand and/or available teaching resources. There may be courses added and changes made to the content. Special Topics Courses (GEOE 495 and GEOE 497) are offered as resources and faculty availability permit. Further information is available from the CEE Undergraduate Office or CEE website.

Specializations
The Faculty of Engineering recognizes three specializations with the Geological Engineering BASc degree. Students who satisfy the specialization requirements (courses and grades) will have the specialization designation shown on their transcript and diploma. Specializations are intended to recognize success in a concentration of electives within the Geological Engineering degree specification. In other words, specializations focus the selection of electives required for the base degree and do not require extra courses.
Each specialization requires students to select TEs with a common theme. Students are responsible for meeting the TE requirements of the Geological Engineering degree when pursuing a specialization. Each specialization requires the successful completion of a minimum number of TEs specified by the specialization with a minimum average of 60%. Students must declare a specialization for it to be recognized as part of their degree and appear on the transcript and diploma.
The specialization course requirements are provided below.
