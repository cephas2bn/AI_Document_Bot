What is Geological Engineering?Geological Engineering is the application of engineering principles to natural materials and fluids such as soils, rocks, groundwater, and petroleum.  Geological engineers search for sources of minerals, groundwater, and petroleum; they also design mines and well fields to develop these resources.Geological engineering and geotechnical engineering are very similar (and many schools group them together under one program); however geological engineering focuses more on natural resources and how to extract them, while geotechnical engineering focuses more on civil engineering practices such as building structures with an eye to the surrounding geology.
