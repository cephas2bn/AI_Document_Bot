Geotechnical engineering,
fundamentally,

in the minerals industry,

deals with the response
of the rock and soil material

in response
to the extraction process.

The geotechnical engineer
would be responsible

for the day-to-day inspections

to keep an eye
on the mining process,

that there's no hazards
forming in the rocks or soil.

He would then attend weekly planning
meetings and report his findings

and highlight hazards
to the mine manager.

So there's a lot
of responsibility on site

for the geotechnical engineer.

When we're mining,

we're obviously removing
large quantities of rock,

and the geotechnical engineer
has to determine

what is a safe slope
of an open pit mine,

so that it does not suddenly
and unexpectedly collapse.

Obviously there are safety issues,

but there are also
production issues.

In an underground mine,
the geotechnical engineer

has to design what is the safe
volume, size and shape of rock

that can be removed

so that the roof
will remain in place.

The geotechnical engineer will also
get involved in road design

and access design.

In a surface mining operation,

obviously we are continually
moving rock,

we're generally going deeper,

and so the road must continue
to access the supply of ore.

And it's not dissimilar
underground -

there must be a continual
tunnelling operation

to maintain the supply of ore
from the underground deposit.

Geotechnical engineers will make
extensive use of technology,

starting with quite complex
testing of rock samples

from drill core
and underground working.

This will then allow them

to put that data into
complex three-dimensional models

that will guide them
in providing the correct mine design

and the correct roof support,
rock support

to provide safe production.

And in some big mines,
or big conditions,

we cannot do that test
in the experimental laboratory.

And sometimes we have field tests,

but still we cannot have a test
for full scale.

That's why we do numerical modelling

and...to do some modelling

to understand
the full mine behaviour.

For this purpose,
we use several softwares

to understand the mechanical
behaviour of the ground

when the mine will excavated.

The geotechnical engineer has to
respond to the changes in geology,

both anticipated and unplanned.

Still we come across faults
and other changes in geology,

and the geotechnical engineer
will have to cope with that.

Different methods of supporting
the slope or the roof

or the rock structure
around the workforce.
