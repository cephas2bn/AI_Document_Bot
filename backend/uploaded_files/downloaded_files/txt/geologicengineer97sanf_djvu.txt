PREFACE 

In  1965,  the  San  Francisco  Bay  Conservation  and  Development  Commission,  or  BCDC 
as  it  is  popularly  known,  came  into  existence  under  Senate  Bill  309.  The  commission 
was  created  in  response  to  public  concern  with  the  piecemeal  filling  of  San  Francisco 
Bay. 

Under  the  bill,  the  commission  is  directed  to  make  a  study  of  the  bay  to  serve  as  the 
basis  for  preparing  a  comprehensive  and  enforceable  plan  for  the  conservation  of  the 
waters  of  San  Francisco  Bay  and  the  development  of  its  shoreline.  As  part  of  the  study 
program,  reports  will  be  prepared  on  23  separate  aspects  of  the  bay,  such  as  water 
pollution,  fish  and  wildlife,  flood  control,  and  tidal  movements.  Some  study  reports 
are  prepared  by  BCDC  staff;  the  remainder  are  prepared  under  contractual  arrange- 
ment with  other  state  agencies,  or  private  consultants. 

One  area  of  great  concern  is  the  development  of  construction  sites  on  marginal  lands 
by  reclamation  or  by  filling.  The  relative  stability  of  these  sites  depends  not  only  upon 
the  manner  in  which  the  site  is  prepared,  but  on  the  natural  conditions  that  relate  to 
the  geology  and  the  seismicity  of  the  area. 

Consequently,  BCDC  called  upon  the  services  of  experts  in  the  various  disciplines: 
Prof.  Harry  Seed  of  the  University  of  California  for  a  discussion  of  seismic  problems 
in  the  use  of  fills  in  San  Francisco  Bay;  Lee  and  Praszker,  Consulting  Engineers,  for  a 
discussion  of  bay  mud  developments  and  related  structural  foundations;  and  Karl 
Steinbrugge,  Structural  Engineer,  for  a  discussion  of  the  seismic  risk  to  buildings  and 
structures  on  filled  lands.  Harold  B.  Goldman  of  the  Division  of  Mines  and  Geology 
provided  the  technical  background  data  on  the  geology  and  mineral  resources  within 
the  bay. 

These  reports  on  geology,  mineral  deposits,  earthquake  hazards,  and  fill  problems 
represent  the  latest  data  available  and  most  recent  thinking  on  these  subjects.  The 
Division  of  Mines  and  Geology  is  reprinting  these  reports  to  effect  a  wider  distribution 
of  invaluable  data  since  the  original  printing  by  BCDC  was  quite  limited  and  not 
widely  distributed. 

The  reports  are  presented  essentially  as  prepared  for  the  BCDC  except  for  some 
minor  editorial  changes.  The  plates  for  the  report  on  geology  have  been  combined 
into  three  separate  maps.

ABSTRACT 

San  Francisco  Bay  came  into  existence  in  mid-  to  late  Pleistocene  time.  The  geologic 
formations  underlying  the  bay  fall  into  two  distinct  units:  a  bedrock  composed  of  sand- 
stone, siltstone,  chert,  and  greenstone  of  the  Franciscan  Formation;  and  a  younger 
unconsolidated  sedimentary  sequence  which  has  been  divided  into  older  bay  mud, 
sand  deposits,  and  younger  bay  mud. 

Seismically  active  faults  bound  San  Francisco  Bay  which  can  be  expected  to  ex- 
perience strong  earthquakes  as  a  result.  The  soft,  water-bearing  sediments,  such  as 
the  bay  mud,  may  be  expected  to  react  strongly  to  such  earthquake-generated  shocks. 

The  mineral  resources  of  San  Francisco  Bay  are  the  sand  deposits  which  occur  in  or 
adjacent  to  existing  channels;  shells  that  are  imbedded  in  the  bay  mud  in  the  southern 
end  of  the  bay;  and  sea  water  as  a  source  of  salines.  Ponds  for  harvesting  salt  cover 
the  marshes  for  many  miles  along  the  shores  of  the  South  Bay  and  San  Pablo  Bay.  In 
1967,  the  value  of  these  minerals  produced  exceeded   12   million  dollars. 

Engineering  problems  associated  with  filling  the  bay  as  urban  expansion  grows  are 
related  to  the  poor  foundation  characteristics  of  the  bay  muds.  Contour  maps  based 
upon  sparse  subsurface  data  show  variability  in  mud  thicknesses  and  in  the  slope  and 
configuration  of  the  bedrock. 

Almost  all  fills  in  San  Francisco  Bay  are  placed  on  top  of  the  younger  bay  mud  which 
is  a  compressible  silty  clay.  Normal  settlement  of  the  fill  takes  place  as  the  underlying 
mud  is  compressed.  Case  histories  of  fills  at  Treasure  Island,  the  San  Francisco  water- 
front, the  U.S.  Naval  Air  Station  at  Alameda,  and  City  of  Oakland  Municipal  Auditorium 
indicate  that  settlement  rates  can  be  calculated. 

Factors  affecting  normal  settlement  are  thickness  of  mud,  method  and  rate  of  filling, 
slope  of  bedrock,  and  type  of  fill.  A  well-designed  fill  will  prevent  mud  from  squeezing 
out  from  underneath  the  fill. 

Under  earthquake  conditions,  the  fill  or  the  underlying  mud  or  sand  may  fail  when 
on  a  steep  slope,  may  settle,  liquefy,  slide,  or  slump.  Proper  analysis  and  design  is 
required  to  insure  stable  fills. 

Buildings  on  fills  must  be  designed  to  take  into  account  stress  induced  by  differential 
settlement.  For  houses  on  fill  over  bay  mud  spread  footing  is  usually  satisfactory;  for 
one-  or  two-story  industrial  buildings,  a  series  of  foundations  tied  together  under  the 
entire  floor  can  be  adequate;  heavier  buildings  should  be  on  piles. 

The  potential  for  damage  to  buildings  during  earthquakes  because  of  ground  failure 
can  be  lessened  by  adequate  soils  engineering  as  the  fill  is  placed,  recognizing  that 
structures  located  on  loose,  water-saturated  material  suffer  far  greater  damage  than 
those  located  on  solid  rock.  A  classification  of  risk  zones  is  proposed  to  prescribe 
maximum  safety  in  the  development  of  potential  bay  fill  areas.

GEOLOGY  OF   SAN  FRANCISCO  BAY 

By  Harold  B.  Goldman 


INTRODUCTION 

Purpose.  The  San  Francisco  Bay  Conservation  and 
Development  Commission  has  been  charged  with  pre- 
paring a  comprehensive  plan  for  the  conservation  of 
the  waters  of  the  bay  and  the  development  of  its 
shoreline.  An  integral  part  of  the  plan  will  be  the 
relationship  between  geology  and  urban  development. 
The  purpose  of  this  report  is  to  provide  the  Bay 
Conservation  and  Development  Commission  with  gen- 
eral information  on  the  geology  of  the  bay,  to  help 
the  Commission  establish  guidelines  for  future  develop- 
ment in  the  bay. 

Scope.  The  aspects  of  geology  pertinent  to  this 
report  are  the  types  and  distribution  of  sediments 
underlying  the  bay,  and  their  suitability  for  filling  and 
construction;  the  nature  and  configuration  of  the  sub- 
surface bedrock,  particularly  on  the  margins  of  the 
bay;  the  areas  of  rilled  lands  and  the  underlying  sedi- 
ments; and  the  location  of  the  major  faults.  The  rela- 
tionship of  the  types  of  sediments  and  their  response 
to  severe  seismic  activity  is  discussed  by  Professor  H. 
Bolton  Seed  in  an  accompanying  report. 

A  total  of  three  months,  from  May  to  August,  1966, 
was  spent  in  collecting,  evaluating  and  preparing  this 
report.  The  published  as  well  as  available  unpublished 
literature  was  searched;  data  were  compiled,  synthe- 
sized, and  reevaluated.  Wherever  possible,  attempts 
were  made  to  correct  obvious  errors  in  the  published 
data  and  to  add  new  information  made  available  in  the 
last  few  years. 

James  Kahle,  geologist  on  temporary  assignment 
with  the  Division  of  Mines  and  Geology  for  this  in- 
terval, assisted  the  author  in  compilation  of  the  data 
and  preparation  of  the  illustrations.  Dr.  Gordon  B. 
Oakeshott  wrote  the  section  on  geologic  features  of 
earthquakes  of  the  bay  area. 

Acknowledgments.  We  wish  to  thank  the  U.  S. 
Army  Corps  of  Engineers  for  its  excellent  cooperation 
in  providing  the  basic  data  and  illustrations  that  were 
used  as  a  prime  source  for  this  report.  Geologists  of 
the  U.  S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  and  the  U.  S. 


Geological  Survey  offered  guidance  in  obtaining  and 
evaluating  new  data  made  available  since  the  Corps  of 
Engineers'  study  for  a  salt  water  barrier  was  published 
in  1963.  The  consulting  firms  of  Dames  and  Moore 
and  Woodward-Clyde-Sherard  and  Associates  kindly 
provided  results  of  their  borings  on  depths  to  bedrock 
and  thickness  of  soft  bay  mud.  Soils  maps  classifying 
the  marginal  lands  on  the  bay  were  furnished  by  the 
U.  S.  Soil  Conservation  Service,  through  the  coopera- 
tion of  the  Association  of  Bay  Area  Governments.  The 
California  Division  of  Bay  Toll  Crossings  supplied  new 
subsurface  sections  along  proposed  crossings  in  the 
South  Bay  and  made  available  the  results  of  their 
borings  for  other  crossings.  The  Vallejo  District  office 
of  the  California  Department  of  Water  Resources  was 
an  excellent  source  of  references  about  the  bay.  The 
Marine  Technology  Center  at  Tiburon  of  the  U.S. 
Bureau  of  Mines  allowed  the  writer  to  study  speci- 
mens of  the  bay  sediments  recovered  by  various

The  regional  geology  provides  a  background  for 
understanding  the  geologic  events  that  led  to  the  pres- 
ent configuration  of  the  bay.  The  spatial  relationship 
of  the  major  active  faults  in  the  area  is  of  direct  con- 
cern because  of  the  related  seismic  activity. 

The  geology  of  the  San  Francisco  Bay  area  was 
mapped  by  Lawson  (1914)  at  a  scale  of  roughly  one 
mile  to  the  inch.  Since  then,  the  geology  of  several 
7  Vi  minute  quadrangles  has  been  mapped  by  the  U.  S. 
Geological  Survey  at  a  scale  of  1:24,000  (see  Bonilla; 
and  Radbruch;  and  Schlocker  in  the  bibliography).  A 
series  of  quadrangle  maps  showing  the  geology  north 
of  San  Francisco  Bay  was  published  by  Weaver 
(1949). 

The  general  geology  of  San  Francisco  Bay  was  dis- 
cussed in  some  detail  in  the  Geologic  Guidebook  of 
the  San  Francisco  Bay  Counties,  Bulletin  154  of  the 
Division  of  Mines  (Jenkins,  1951).  The  articles  therein 
formed  the  basis  for  the  following  discussion.

Geomorphology.  Land  Form 

The  San  Francisco  Bay  area  is  a  wide,  north-trend- 
ing depression  that  lies  between  crudely  parallel  ridges 
and  extends  north  toward  Santa  Rosa  and  south 
through  the  Santa  Clara  Valley.  On  the  west  are  ridges 
that  comprise  the  San  Francisco  and  Marin  Peninsulas. 
They  are  separated  by  the  Golden  Gate  channel  which 
is  the  drowned  valley  of  the  ancestral  Sacramento 
River. 

On  the  east,  the  Berkeley  Hills  extend  for  40  miles 
and  are  flanked  on  the  west  by  a  low,  gently  sloping 
plain  that  borders  the  east  shore  of  the  bay.  The  Berke- 
ley Hills  are  cut  off  by  the  Sacramento  River  on  the 
north. 

San  Francisco  Bay  is  about  55  miles  long  and  from 
three  to  twelve  miles  wide.  Constrictions  divide  the 
bay  into  Suisun  and  San  Pablo  Bays  on  the  north,  and 
into  north  and  south  San  Francisco  Bays.  Most  of  the 
bay  is  shallow  with  water  depths  of  less  than  10  feet 
except  deep  channels  that  represent  drowned  drain- 
age systems  are  present.  The  deepest  point,  approxi- 
mately 340  feet  below  sea  level,  is  in  the  main  chan- 
nel through  the  Golden  Gate.  Islands  such  as  Angel, 
YerbaBuena,  and  Alcatraz  are  the  tops  of  buried  hills. 

One  of  the  most  striking  topographic  features  is  the 
San  Andreas  rift  zone,  which  bisects  Marin  and  San 
Mateo  Counties,  passing  west  of  the  city  of  San  Fran- 
cisco. The  fault  separates  the  Marin  Peninsula  on  the 
east  from  the  Point  Reyes  Peninsula  on  the  west;  and 
the  San  Francisco  "block"  from  the  Montara  Moun- 
tain "block."  The  San  Francisco-Marin  "eastern  block" 
includes  the  area  east  of  the  San  Andreas  fault  zone 
and  extends  easterly  to  the  Hayward  fault  zone  near 
the  western  base  of  the  Berkeley  Hills.  This  block 
consists  of  a  series  of  northwest-trending  ridges  of 
which  San  Bruno  Mountain  and  Burri  Burri  Ridge  are 
the  principal  summits,  and  the  San  Francisco  Bay  de- 
pression. Merced  Valley  lies  between  these  two  ridges 
and  opens  to  the  southeast  into  San  Francisco  Bay. 

Stratigraphy:  Rock  Sequence 

The  San  Francisco  Bay  area  contains  most  of  the 
rock  units  present  in  the  central  Coast  Ranges.  These 
units  have  been  faulted  and  folded  into  structures 
typical  of  the  Coast  Ranges  as  a  whole.  The  general 
distribution  of  these  rocks,  which  range  in  age  from 
Jurassic  to  Recent,  is  presented  on  figure  1. 

Jurassic-Cretaceous  (KJf-KJfv) 

The  oldest  rock  exposed  in  the  San  Francisco-Marin 
block  are  those  of  the  Franciscan  Formation,  probably 
Cretaceous  in  this  block.  The  San  Francisco  Peninsula 
is  the  type  locality  for  the  Franciscan,  which  was 
named  by  Lawson  in  1895.  This  formation  consists 
principally  of  interbedded  sandstone  and  shale,  lime- 
stone, radiolarian  chert,  and  metavolcanic  rock.  The 
sedimentary  rocks  have  been  intruded  by  diabase,  gab- 
bro,  and  serpentine.  Locally,  metamorphism  (change 
by  heat  and  pressure)  has  produced  glaucophane 
schists.  Neither  the  top  or  the  bottom  of  the  Fran- 
ciscan Formation  has  been  identified,  so  the  total  thick- 
ness is  unknown;  however,  it  is  at  least  10,000  feet 
thick  and  may  be  as  much  as  40-50,000  feet  thick. 


Franciscan  rocks  are  well-exposed  in  the  city  of  Sa 
Francisco,  east  of  the  San  Andreas  fault  in  Marin  an 
San  Mateo  Counties,  in  and  west  of  the  Haywarc 
Chabot  fault  zone  in  the  western  margin  of  the  Berk( 
ley  Hills;  and  comprise  the  bedrock  underlying  tb 
alluvium  and  waters  of  the  bay  and  exposures  in  th 
islands  of  the  bay.

The  oldest  rocks  known  in  the  bay  area  are  sch 
and  limestone  that  have  been  intruded  by  granite  (m

ited  to  Montara  Mountain,  the  southern  end  of  t 
Point  Reyes  Peninsula,  and  the  Farallon  Islands, 
not  occur  east  of  the  San  Andreas  fault.  The  age

■southern  San  Mateo  County.  The  Purisima,  which 
ges  in  age  from  late  Miocene  to  middle  Pliocene, 
lins  a  maximum  thickness  of  10,000  feet.  Strata  of

sible  correlatives  in  the  east  bay  are  thin,  non-marine

Volcanics  which  overlies  the  Franciscan  Formation, 
and  mterfingers  with  the  Merced  Formation  in  Marin 
and  Sonoma  Counties. 

Upper  Pliocene-Pleistocene  (QP) 

Poorly-sorted,  lenticular  gravel,  sand,  silt,  and  clay 
occur  as  alluvial  fan  deposits  comprising  the  Santa 
Clara  Formation  east  of  the  San  Andreas  fault  zone 
in  San  Mateo  and  Marin  Counties. 

Mid-Pleistocene  to  Recent  (Qm,  Qc,  Qt,  Qb,  Qal,  Qs) 

Poorly-sorted  lenticular  alluvial  sand,  silt,  gravel, 
and  clay  comprise  a  number  of  geologic  units  that 
range  from  Pleistocene  to  Recent  in  age.  Unconsoli- 
dated sand  occurs  in  the  Colma  Formation  on  Angel 
Island  and  on  the  San  Francisco  Peninsula.  Dune  sand 
covers  more  than  half  of  the  northern  part  of  the  San 
Francisco  Peninsula.  The  Alameda  Formation  contains 
sand,  silt,  clay,  and  gravel  and  underlies  the  bay  and 
coastal  plain  alluvium  on  the  east  side  of  the  bay,  at- 
taining a  maximum  known  thickness  of  1,050  feet. 

Layers  of  clayey  gravel,  sand,  silt,  clay,  and  gravel 
of  the  Temescal  Formation,  Merritt  Sand,  and  San 
Antonio  Formation  overlie  the  Alameda  Formation  on 
the  plain  between  the  Berkeley  Hills  and  the  bay,  and 
underlie  parts  of  San  Francisco  Bay. 

Fine  sand,  silty  clay,  and  mud  of  Recent  age  under- 
lie the  waters  of  the  bay  and  some  artificially  filled 
areas  on  the  margins. 

GEOLOGIC  STRUCTURE 

The  San  Francisco  Bay  area  lies  within  the  Coast 
Ranges  geomorphic  province  which  is  characterized 
by  a  series  of  nearly  parallel  mountain  ranges  that 
trend  obliquely  to  the  coast  in  a  northwesterly  direc- 
tion. The  alignment  of  major  fault  zones,  fold  axes, 
and  geological  units  emphasizes  this  northwestern 
structural  grain.  This  grain  was  developed  in  response 
to  northeast-southwest  compressional  forces  of  un- 
known origin.  The  bay  itself  has  a  more  northerly 
trend  than  the  major  structures  which  are  therefore 
intersected  at  their  margins. 

The  San  Francisco  Bay  trough  was  formed  by  a 
combination  of  warping  and  faulting  (bending  and 
breaking  of  layers  of  rock)  and  is  underlain  by  a 
down-dropped  or  tilted  block. 

The  major  active  faults  in  the  area  are  the  San 
Andreas  fault  which  transects  the  San  Francisco  and 
Marin  Peninsulas,  the  Hayward  fault  at  the  base  of 
the  Berkeley  Hills,  and  the  Sunol-Calaveras  fault  at 
the  west  end  of  the  Livermore  Valley.  The  latter 
merges  northward  into  the  Franklin  fault  zone  which 
is  possibly  inactive. 

STRUCTURAL  HISTORY 

The  geologic  history  of  the  bay  area  is  character- 
ized by  a  long  record  of  extensive  earth  movement  and 
seismic  activity  that  is  complicated  by  changes  in  sea 
level  related  to  Pleistocene  glaciations  (within  the  last 
one  million  years).

The  San  Francisco  Bay  area  as  it  is  known  today 
came  into  existence  in  mid-  to  late-Pleistocene  time. 
Rocks  of  the  Franciscan  Formation  were  deposited  in 
extremely  deep,  narrow  troughs  at  the  foot  of  the 
continental  slope  from  late  Jurassic  to  mid-Cretaceous 
time.  Sediments  of  the  Knoxville  and  Cretaceous  for- 
mations were  deposited  on  shallower  marine  shelves,  as 
were  also  sedimentary  and  volcanic  materials  of  the 
Tertiary  period.  After  deposition  of  extensive  Creta- 
ceous and  Tertiary  sediments,  the  formations  were 
folded  (bent)  and  faulted  (broken)  by  a  series  of 
earth  movements  into  the  northwest-trending  struc- 
tural pattern  of  the  central  Coast  Ranges.  During  latest 
Miocene  and  much  of  Pliocene  time,  the  bay  block 
was  high-standing  and  was  being  eroded  to  supply 
sediments  both  to  its  west  and  east. 

The  San  Francisco  Bay  trough  did  not  come  into 
existence  until  the  end  of  the  Pliocene  epoch  or  dur- 
ing the  Pleistocene.  It  was  formed  by  a  combination 
of  warping  and  faulting.  The  San  Francisco-Mann 
block  was  tilted  toward  the  east,  with  the  western 
edge  forming  the  San  Francisco  and  Marin  hills,  and 
the  depressed  eastern  edge  forming  the  uneven  depres- 
sion in  which  the  bay  now  lies.  In  Pleistocene  time 
(within  the  last  one  million  years)  the  trough  was 
nearly  filled  with  sediments,  some  of  marine  origin, 
others  derived  from  the  surrounding  hills. 

During  the  interglacial  stages  of  the  Pleistocene 
Epoch,  the  trough  which  became  San  Francisco  Bay 
was  flooded  by  the  general  rise  in  sea  level  due  to  the 
release  of  melt  water  from  glaciers  in  other  parts  of 
the  world.  Bay  mud  was  deposited  during  and  after 
the  melting  of  the  continental  glaciers  in  Wisconsin 
time. 


GEOLOGIC  FEATURES  OF  EARTHQUAKES 
IN  THE  BAY  AREA 

By  Gordon  B.  Oakeshort 

Alaska,  California,  and  Nevada  are  the  most  seismic 
states  in  the  United  States;  over  90  percent  of  the 
country's  damaging  earthquakes  have  originated  in 
these  three  states.  Abundant  historical  evidence  exists 
(see  the  accompanying  report  by  Karl  V.  Stein- 
brugge),  to  show  that  the  San  Francisco  Bay  area, 
in  a  section  from  San  Francisco  to  San  Juan  Bautista, 
is  one  of  the  few  areas  in  California  in  which  there  is 
currently  a  high  incidence  of  earthquakes.  The  bay 
counties  have  experienced  about  12  damaging  earth- 
quakes in  the  past  century.  From  studies  of  repeated 
geodetic  measurements  across  the  major  fault  zones, 
seismicity,  and  calculated  rate  of  strain  accumulation, 
it  seems  reasonable  to  expect  a  great  earthquake  (com- 
parable to  the  San  Francisco  earthquake  of  1906)  once 
in  60  to  100  years.  The  history  of  major  and  great 
earthquakes  in  the  world  indicates  that  there  is  no 
regular  periodicity,  so  it  is  obvious  that  such  figures 
cannot  be  used  for  earthquake  prediction  but  only  for 
indicated  expected  frequency.  All  evidence  points  to 


the  conclusion  that  areas  of  historically  high  seismicit 
are  the  places  where  damaging  earthquakes  are  mo: 
likely  to  center  in  the  future. 

Figure  1  shows  epicenters  of  earthquakes  of  magn. 

tude  4  and  greater  in  relation  to  the  major  faults.  Bas: 

data  for  the  plot  of  epicenters  come  from  the  Un 

versity  of  California  Seismograph  Station,  Berkeley 

and  have  been  compiled  and  published  through  196 

by  the  State  Department  of  Water  Resources  (1964 

Damaging  earthquakes  result  from  movements  o| 

faults  that  abruptly  break  the  rocks  of  the  outer  po; 

tion  of  the  earth's  crust  along  rough  planes.  In  Cal 

fornia  the  depth  of  focus  (point  where  the  motio 

or  earthquake,  appears  to  originate)  is  usually  on  tl 

order  of  3  to  10  miles.  Geologically,  then,  the  reasc 

for  high  frequency  of  earthquakes  in  the  bay   an 

is  apparent:  there  are  major  active  faults  on  both  sid 

of  the  bay.  These  are  the  San  Andreas  fault  on  tl 

west  and  the  Hayward  and  Calaveras  faults  on  tl 

east.   These   faults,    and    their   branches,    are    close 

related  and  together  comprise  an  important  part  of  tl 

San   Andreas   fault   system.   These   three   faults,   ar 

probably  some  of  their  minor  branches,  are  actk 

An  active  fault  is  one  on  which  displacement  has  take 

place  in  historic  time  as  evidenced  by  linear  patter 

of  earthquake  epicenters,  or  by  surface  slippage,  i 

"creep,"  along  the  fault  trace.  Some  geologists  al 

consider  active  those  faults  that  mapping  shows  ha  : 

displaced  geologically  recent  alluvium  and  along  whii 

there  are  land  forms,  typical  of  fault  zones,  that  ha 

not  existed  long  enough  to  be  greatly  modified  by  t! 

normal  geologic  processes  of  erosion  and  depositic 

Even  if  the  San  Andreas  fault  had  not  been  the  loc 

of  many  earthquakes  and  present-day  creep  in  sor 

places,  we  would  recognize  it  as  active  (and  therefo 

a  potential  source  of  earthquakes)  because  of  its  stri; 

ing  linear  rift-valley  features  such  as  the  long,  narrc; 

Tomales  Bay,  the  San  Andreas  and  Crystal  Sprin 

Lakes  on  the  peninsula,  sag  ponds,  notched  ridges,  ai 

displaced  and  fault-oriented  drainage  features  along  t 

fault  trace. 

What  Happens  in  an  Earthquake 

Recognizing,  then,  that  the  San  Francisco  Bay  1 
is  an  area  of  active  faults  and  high  earthquake  fi;

round  Shaking 

Ground  shaking — the  earthquake  itself — consists  of 
mplex  surface  wave  motion  which  has  traveled 
ough  the  rock  materials  of  the  outer  crust.  Earth- 
ake  waves,  like  other  waves,  may  be  reflected,  re- 
cted,  attenuated,  and  change  velocity  and  period  as 
■y  pass  through  different  materials,  thus  making  the 
mnd  motion  complex.  In  general,  earthquake  waves, 
passing  from  more  dense  solid  rock  to  less  dense 
ivial  and  water-saturated  materials,  tend  to  become 
uced  in  velocity,  increased  in  amplitude,  and  accel- 
rcions  become  greater.  Ground  motion  lasts  longer 
noose,  water-saturated,  incompetent  materials  than 
i  rock.  It  is  also  amplified  to  an  unknown  extent, 
le  to  a  combination  of  factors,  structures  located  on 


such  materials  suffer  far  greater  damage  than  those 
located  on  solid  rock.  This  has  been  repeatedly  and 
strikingly  demonstrated  in  large  earthquakes,  includ- 
ing Tokyo  1923,  Fukui  1948,  Arvin-Tehachapi  1952, 
Chile  1960,  and  Alaska  1964.  In  all  these  cases,  and 
many  others,  the  violence  of  ground  motion  in  soft 
alluvial  materials  was  significantly  greater  than  in  solid 
rock.  Amplification  of  ground  motion  is  greatest  in 
unconsolidated,  saturated  sediments. 

To  bring  the  experience  closer  to  home,  the  Earth- 
quake Commission  Report  on  the  San  Francisco  1906 
earthquake  documented  exaggerated  shaking  in  the 
lower  waterfront  areas  of  San  Francisco,  underlain  by 
the  thickest  bay  mud  and  fill,  as  compared  to  lesser 
shaking  in  Nob  Hill  and  similar  areas  with  more  solid

rock  at  or  near  the  surface.  Many  earthquakes  have 
shown  that  "poor  ground"  is  a  greater  hazard  than 
proximity  to  the  fault  and  epicenter.  In  1906,  Santa 
Rosa  and  San  Jose,  both  underlain  by  alluvium,  suf- 
fered to  an  extent  out  of  proportion  to  their  distances 
from  the  fault  movement.  There  is  some  evidence  to 
show  that  ground  motion  tends  to  increase  with  the 
depth  of  alluvium. 

Unfortunately,  comparatively  little  instrumental  data 
exists  on  the  difference  in  response  of  different  types 
of  rock  and  soil  to  wave  motion.  One  of  the  greatest 
research  needs  is  to  establish  a  close  network  of  strong- 
motion  seismic  instruments  on  the  different  kinds  of 
rock  and  soil  in  many  spots  in  and  around  the  bay  to 
monitor  and  record  the  effects  of  the  dozens  of  minor 
— and  the  occasional  major — earthquakes  felt  in  this 
area  every  year.  This  would  yield  extremely  valuable 
data  fundamental  to  development  of  the  bay  and  its 
margins. 

Surface  Faulting 

Fault  rupture,  which  begins  at  the  focus,  may  extend 
to  the  surface,  especially  in  moderate  to  large  earth- 
quakes. The  direction  of  separation  of  the  earth  on 
opposite  sides  of  a  fault  plane  may  be  vertical,  hori- 
zontal, or  oblique.  In  moderately  large  earthquakes, 
surface  scarps  (the  exposed  scar)  may  well  be  as  high 
as  20  feet  (Hebgen  Lake,  Montana,  1959,  magnitude 
7.1)  or,  in  smaller  earthquakes,  only  a  few  inches  high 
(Herlong,  Plumas  County,  California,  1950,  magnitude 
5.75).  Recently  observed  movements  on  the  San  An- 
dreas, Hayward,  and  Calaveras  faults  seem  to  be  of  the 
horizontal  type,  east  block  moving  relatively  south. 
Maximum  displacement  of  this  type,  San  Francisco 
1906,  magnitude  8.25,  was  20  feet,  just  south  of  To- 
males  Bay;  Hayward  1868  was  3  feet;  Fort  Tejon, 
1857,  was  perhaps  as  great  as  30  feet.  Arvin-Tehachapi 
1952,  magnitude  7.7,  on  the  White  Wolf  fault,  had 
oblique-slip  displacement  amounting  to  about  2  feet 
of  upward  movement  on  the  south  and  a  like  amount 
of  horizontal  movement,  south  block  moving  eastward. 
There  was  no  surface  faulting  in  the  San  Francisco 
1957,  magnitude  5.3,  earthquake.  While  historical  dis- 
placements on  the  faults  of  the  San  Andreas  system 
have  been  predominantly  horizontal,  there  is  much 
geological  evidence  to  show  that  slightly  older  move- 
ments have  involved  a  great  deal  of  vertical  displace- 
ment. Vertical  movement  on  faults  in  future  earth- 
quakes in  the  bay  area  cannot  be  ruled  out.  Judging 
from  geology  and  earthquake  history,  it  appears  un- 
likely that  important  active  faults  exist  in  rock  under 
the  bay  itself,  except  that  the  Hayward  fault  probably 
extends  to  the  north  across  San  Pablo  Bay.  Surface 
faulting  not  only  develops  scarps,  but  also  trenches 
(graben),  patterns  of  ground  fractures,  "mole  tracks" 
or  pressure  ridges,  and  open  or  closed  fissures. 

Recently,  evidence  has  been  accumulating  that  spas- 
modic slippage  ("creep")  is  now  occurring  on  the 
Hayward  fault  trace  and  on  the  San  Andreas  fault, 
with  many  individual  slips  not  accompanied  by  felt 
earthquakes. 

Faulting  not  only  disturbs  the  ground  surface  but 
also   disturbs  and   dislocates   drainage  features,  both 


natural  and  artificial.  Springs  and  ground-water  flo 
characteristics  may  be  changed. 

Landsliding 

Landslides,  rock  falls,  avalanches,  mud  and  deb 
flows  and  general  gravitational  movements  of  loc 
and  weathered   rock  and  soil  are  major  effects 
ground  shaking  in  earthquakes  of  magnitude  5  ai 
greater.  Such  mass  movements  are  readily  triggered  1 
earthquakes,  especially  where  slopes  are  oversteepeni 
from  whatever  cause,  and  where  earth  materials  a, 
water-saturated,  from  artificial  means  or  the  natuj' 
rainy-season.  An  immense  amount  of  sliding  takes  pla 
in  large  earthquakes  but  even  small  earthquakes,  sui 
as  San  Francisco   1957,  cause  many  damaging  slid! 
At  Hebgen  Lake,  Montana  1959,  a  rock  slide  carrij 
43,000,000  cubic  yards  of  loose  rock  across  the  Mai' 
son  River.  State  Highway   1,  on  the  coast  south 
San  Francisco,  was  closed  by  large  landslides  in  t 
small  earthquake  of  1957.  The  San  Andreas,  Haywai 
and  Calaveras  fault  zones  are  marked  by  a  successi 
of   many   geologically-recent   slides,   many   of   th&lt; 
highly  unstable.  The  steep  hills  on  both  sides  of  t 
bay  are  particularly  vulnerable  to  sliding. 

Recent  work  has  shown  that  certain  types  of  san 
and  clayey  sediments  become  "quick"  as  a  result 
shaking  and  lose  all  cohesive  strength.  Such  materi 
may  flow  like  a  thick  fluid  down  extremely  low-anj 
slopes.  Flow  tends  to  be  toward  a  "free"  face,  ev 
though  the  flow  may  be  nearly  horizontal.  Liquef; 
tion  was  a  major  factor  in  the  disastrous  slides  in  t 
Turnagain  Heights  area  of  Anchorage  in  the  Alask 
earthquake  of  March  27,  1964.  Whether  such  s 
liquefaction  would  take  place  in  San  Francisco  B 
muds  is  not  known;  research  is  greatly  needed  on  1 
properties  and  characteristics  of  bay  mud.  (See  t 
accompanying  report  by  H.  Bolton  Seed.) 


Lurch  Cracking 

The  development  of  all  types  and  sizes  of  irregu 
fractures,  cracks,  and  fissures — largely  as  the  result! 
sliding,  settling  and  shaking,  and  the  passage  of  surffj 
earthquake  waves — is  characteristic,   to  a  greater 
lesser  extent,  in  all  earthquakes  large  enough  for  s 
nificant  ground  motion  to  occur.  Such  fractures  rr 
be  many  feet  long  and  may  displace  surface  weathei 
rock  and  soil  both  horizontally  and  vertically,  just 
true  fault  movement  would.  Lurch  cracks  rarely  oc&lt; 
in  solid  rock;  they  are  essentially  confined  to  wea 
ered  rock,  alluvium,  and  soil.  Their  patterns  may 
completely  irregular  or  may  show  marked  regular 
where  controlled  by  shallow  bedrock,  by  the  outl 
of  natural  or  artificial  fill,  by  highway  surfacing,  e 
Lurch  cracking  is  often  accompanied  by  sand  b&lt; 
and  mud  volcanoes  as  groundwater  moves  to  the  s 
face.  Extensive  and  damaging  lurch  cracking  has  i 
curred  in  incompetent  water-saturated  materials  in 
moderate  to  large  earthquakes  (magnitudes  6  to 
Damage  resulting  from  this  type  of  ground  fracti 
was  extensive  in  the  waterfront  areas  of  San  Francii: 
in  1906,  in  the  irrigated  alluvium  and  soil  of  the  sou! 
em  San  Joaquin  Valley  in  the  Arvin-Tehachapi  ear&gt; 
quake  of  1952,  in  the  Long  Beach  earthquake  of  19j

and  in  similar  materials  in  every  earthquake  of  dam- 
aging intensity.  Undoubtedly,  such  cracking  will  be  a 
major  damage  factor  in  many  areas  of  bay  mud  and 
fill  in  future  earthquakes  of  moderate  to  large  magni- 
tude in,  or  near,  the  bay.  Lurch  cracking  may  occur 
in  water-saturated  sediments,  soils,  and  alluvium  at 
distances  up  to  75  miles  from  the  epicenter,  as  demon- 
strated most  recently  in  the  Alaskan  earthquake.  There 
is  some  evidence  to  indicate  that  lurch  cracking  is 
perhaps  most  extensive  in  the  deeper  alluvial  materials. 

Subsidence,  Slumping,  Compaction,  Uplift 

Especially  in  great  earthquakes,  such  as  San  Fran- 
cisco 1906  and  Alaska  1964,  but  also  in  moderately 
large  earthquakes,  such  as  Hebgen  Lake  1959  and 
Arvin-Tehachapi  1952,  there  are  extensive  changes  in 
level  and  elevation  of  the  land  surface.  These  may  take 
the  form  of  broad  uplift  or  subsidence,  tilting  of  lim- 
ited to  large  areas,  and  local  slumping  on  the  order 
of  massive  landsliding.  Such  earth  movements  may 
even  pass  unnoticed  in  inland  areas,  but  become  major 
factors  along  the  shores  of  seas,  bays,  and  lakes.  Since 
historic  displacements  on  the  faults  of  the  San  Andreas 
system  have  been  largely  horizontal,  this  category  of 
ground  movements  has  not  so  far  been  of  overriding 
focal  concern.  However,  even  small  upward,  down- 
ward, or  tilting  movements  become  of  great  concern 
^long  a  highly  developed  shoreline,  such  as  that  of 
irhe  bay. 

I  Compaction  of  soils  and  alluvial  materials  may  take 
jDlace  extensively,  and  irregularly,  in  soils  and  fine- 
grained water-saturated  sediments.  In  an  earthquake, 
(:his  takes  place  primarily  as  a  result  of  shaking;  com- 
paction is  induced  by  the  vibration.  It  may  amount 
:o  a  few  inches  or  several  feet  in  soft  materials;  it  does 
[lot  occur  in  firm  rock. 

iSeismic  Sea  Waves  (Tsunamis)  and  Seiches 

The  seismic  sea  wave,  tsunami,  or  "tidal  wave"  is 
jrobably  caused  by  faulting  and  other  abrupt  ground 
novements  on  the  ocean  floor  in  connection  with  a 
;najor  earthquake.  Such  waves  move  at  high  velocity, 
is  much  as  300  to  400  miles  per  hour  in  the  open  sea, 
nay  have  a  wave-length  of  many  miles,  and  have  low 
Relative  amplitudes.  At  sea,  they  are  not  noticeable 
)ut  pile  up  water  on  shore  to  heights  of  up  to  perhaps 
''0  feet.  Search  of  the  historic  records  shows  that  no 
1  sunami  has  raised  sea  level  along  the  California  coast 
;'nore  than  a  few  feet.  This  coast,  nevertheless,  has  been 
•isited  by  such  waves  several  times,  generated  by 
llistant  earthquakes.  Crescent  City,  California,  was 
Llamaged  and  several  lives  were  lost  by  this  type  of 
vave  (which  arrived  close  to  the  time  forecast  in 
varnings  issued  by  the  U.S.  Coast  and  Geodetic  Sur- 
rey) caused  by  the  Alaskan  earthquake  of  1964;  the 
California  coast  was  also  affected  by  a  tsunami  in 
|  onnection  with  Chilean  earthquake  of  1960.  A  rise  of 
j  rater  of  even  2  or  3  feet  in  San  Francisco  Bay  due  to 
•  tsunami,  if  coupled  with  a  high  tide  and  on-shore 
I  rind,  could  do  serious  damage  to  near-sea-level  devel- 
opments. The  tsunami  warning  system  of  the  U.  S. 
'■  Coast  and  Geodetic  Survey  is  efficient  and  should  give 
)cal  warning  in  ample  time  to  reduce  loss  of  life  to 


almost  zero.  Unfortunately,  experience  has  shown  that 
people  do  not  always  heed  such  warnings. 

A  seiche  is  a  periodic  oscillation,  or  "sloshing"  of 
water  in  an  enclosed  basin  such  as  that  of  a  lake  or 
bay.  It  is  usually  due  to  earthquake  motion,  in  con- 
nection with  a  moderate  to  large  shock.  The  periods 
of  oscillation  range  from  minutes  to  hours,  depending 
on  the  size  and  configuration  of  the  basin  affected.  In 
great  earthquakes,  seiches  have  been  observed  several 
thousands  miles  from  the  epicenter.  Seiches  could  only 
be  damaging  in  San  Francisco  Bay  in  the  event  of  a 
large  earthquake  and  "right"  combination  of  tide  and 
wind. 

Conclusions 

San  Francisco  Bay  is  well  known  as  an  area  of  high 
earthquake  frequency.  In  addition  to  many  minor 
shocks,  expected  frequency  of  damaging  earthquakes 
is  about  12  per  century;  at  least  one  of  these  each 
century  may  be  expected  to  be  a  great  earthquake, 
comparable  to  San  Francisco  1906. 

Geologic  disturbances  that  accompany  moderate-to- 
strong  earthquakes  in  the  bay  area  are:  surface  fault 
ruptures  involving  horizontal  breakage  up  to  20  feet 
and  possible  vertical  displacements  of  several  feet;  in- 
tense ground  shaking;  extensive  landsliding  and  associ- 
ated mass  movements  off  unstable  slopes;  extensive 
lurch  cracking  confined  to  alluvial  materials,  natural 
and  artificial  fill;  compaction  and  perhaps  soil  flowage 
on  very  low  slopes  in  bay  mud;  relatively  small  seismic 
sea  waves  and  seiches  to  the  possible  extent  of  causing 
shoreline  damage,  originating  from  distant  as  well  as 
local  earthquakes. 

Geologic  and  seismologic  considerations,  supported 
by  the  historic  record,  show  that  earthquake  shaking 
and  accelerations,  lurch  cracking,  slumping,  and  com-  , 
paction  are  all  greatly  amplified  in  water-saturated  or 
loose  alluvial  sediments,  as  compared  to  such  features 
developed  in  adjacent  solid  rock. 

Research,  partly  under  way  in  the  bay  area,  must 
be  increased  along  these  lines: 

1.  Detailed  geologic  mapping  and  soils  surveys; 

2.  Determination  of  the  properties  and  characteris- 
tics of  bay  muds  and  other  natural  materials  on  the 
bay  margins; 

3.  Seismologic  studies,  including  particularly  strong- 
motion  work  in  the  response-to-shaking  of  bay  muds 
and  local  rock  formations; 

4.  Earthquake-resistant  design  and  construction  of 
buildings; 

5.  Code  requirements  concerning  foundation  ma- 
terials as  well  as  structures;  and 

6.  Construction  of  geologic-hazards  maps  as  a  basis 
for  zoning  the  bay  and  its  margins. 

GEOLOGY  OF  SAN  FRANCISCO  BAY  PROPER 
Previous  Work 
One  of  the  pioneer  works  on  the  geology  of  San 
Francisco  Bay  and  its  influence  on  engineering  prob- 
lems was  published  by  Trask  and  Rolston  (1951),  in 
conjunction  with  an  investigation  of  two  proposed 
crossings  of  the  bay.

California  Division  of  Mines  and  Geology 


[SR  97 


In  1955,  the  California  Department  of  Water  Re- 
sources released  a  report  on  the  feasibility  of  construc- 
tion by  the  State  of  barriers  in  the  San  Francisco  Bay 
system.  The  geology  appendix,  H,  contains  data  on 
the  thickness  and  depth  of  the  mud  in  the  bay  ob- 
tained from  a  compilation  of  more  than  2,000  logs  of 
borings. 

Since  then  the  work  of  the  U.  S.  Geological  Survey 
(Schlocker  et  al.,  1958;  Radbruch,  1957;  Radbruch  and 
Schlocker,  1958;  Bonilla,  1965)  has  contributed  much 
to  the  knowledge  of  the  geologic  units  on  the  margins 
of  the  bay. 

The  study  by  the  U.  S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers 
(1963),  for  a  salt  water  barrier  contains  a  wealth  of 
data  on  the  distribution  and  engineering  properties  of 
the  sediments  in  the  bay,  and  on  configuration  of  the 
bedrock  surface.  Appendix  E  from  their  publication 
provided  the  basic  data  for  the  illustrations  in  this 
report. 

Treasher  (1963)  discussed  the  characteristics  of  the 
sediments  in  the  bay,  the  geologic  history  of  the  bay, 
and  refined  the  contour  maps  published  by  the  Corps 
of  Engineers. 

The  distribution  of  the  sediments  on  the  floor  of  the 
bay  was  discussed  in  a  paper  by  Trask  (1953). 

Geologic  Formations 

The  geologic  formations  underlying  San  Francisco 
Bay  are  divided  into  two  distinct  units  that  differ 
greatly  in  age,  type  of  rock,  and  mode  of  occurrence: 
an  older  unit  that  forms  the  bedrock,  and  a  younger, 
unconsolidated  sedimentary  sequence. 

Bedrock  Unit 

The  bedrock  underlying  most  of  San  Francisco  Bay 
is  composed  of  sandstone,  siltstone,  chert,  and  green- 
stone of  the  Franciscan  Formation.  Upper  Cre- 
taceous sandstone  forms  the  bedrock  in  the  Carquinez 
Straits.  The  bedrock  crops  out  on  the  margins  and 
on  the  surface  of  the  bay  and  is  encountered  in  drill 
holes.  The  distribution  of  the  Franciscan  is  shown  on 
the  geologic  map,  plate  1. 

The  general  configuration  of  the  bedrock  surface 
insofar  as  known  is  shown  on  the  contour  map,  plate 
2.  The  bedrock  surface  drops  off  sharply  on  the  mar- 
gin of  the  west  side  of  the  bay  and  deepens  to  the 
east.  Based  upon  sparse  information,  bedrock  is  gen- 
erally deepest  in  the  southern  part  of  the  bay  where 
depths  of  300  to  800  feet  are  common.  Radbruch 
(1957)  lists  depths  near  Alameda  that  range  from  300 
feet  to  400  feet,  with  one  drill  hole  there  encountering 
"bedrock"  at  roughly  1,050  feet,  reinforcing  the  con- 
cept of  eastward  tilting  of  a  downthrown  block.  The 
bedrock  surface,  which  was  modified  by  stream  ero- 
sion prior  to  deposition  of  the  youngest  sediments,  and 
the  location  of  ancient  drainage  divides  is  known  only 
from  drill  holes  and  subbottom  profiles.  The  bedrock 
surface  is  very  irregular. 

The  problems  of  the  bedrock  relate  primarily  to 
the  strength  of  the  rock  for  foundation  purposes  and 
the  slope  of  the  bedrock  surface.  A  surface  of  con- 
siderable relief  and  variation  in  depth  of  weathering 
was  developed  on  the  Franciscan  rocks  prior  to  depo-

sition  of  the  bay  muds.  Because  the  weathering  weak- 
ened the  rock  surface,  placement  of  foundations  upon 
steeply  sloping  parts  of  the  old  topography  should  be 
thoroughly  investigated  so  that  proper  foundation  de- 
sign can  be  provided  to  avoid  problems. 

Younger  Unconsolidated  Sedimentary  Sequence 

Sediments  accumulated  to  thicknesses  of  more  that 
300  feet  during  the  formation  of  the  present  bay.  Thi; 
sedimentary  sequence  was  subdivided  by  Trask  anc 
Rolston  (1951)  into  five  formations  so  as  to  correlate 
with  the  formations  that  Lawson  had  mapped  on  the 
east  side  of  the  bay.  Subsequent  work  by  the  Corp; 
of  Engineers  (1963)  and  Treasher  (1963)  question  the 
validity  of  extrapolating  these  correlations  for  any 
distance  from  the  area  where  Trask  recognized  these 
subsurface  units.  Treasher  felt  the  units  are  so  uniform 
in  grain  size  and  mineralogy  that  the  principal  differ- 
ences were  the  degree  of  consolidation  and  strati- 
graphic  position.  In  his  study,  he  divided  the  sedi- 
ments into  an  older  bay  mud,  sand  deposits,  and  a 
younger  bay  mud.  The  younger  bay  mud  he  further 
divided  into  a  semiconsolidated  member  below  and  a 
soft  member  above. 

Because  of  the  lack  of  time  to  re-evaluate  the  thou- 
sands of  individual  drill  logs  and  make  new  correla- 
tions and  interpretations,  it  was  decided  to  adopt  foi 
this  report  the  units  as  used  by  the  Corps  of  Engineers 
and  Treasher.  A  correlation  chart  is  presented  in  table 
2.  Geologic  sections  across  northern  San  Franciscc 
Bay  are  presented  in  figure  2.  Sections  across  south- 
ern San  Francisco  Bay  are  presented  in  figure  3.

that  blankets  and  fills  old  stream  channels  cut  in  the 
bedrock,  and  which  is  overlain  either  by  a  sand  unit 
or  "younger  bay  mud."  The  older  bay  mud  corre- 
sponds to  the  Aiameda,  San  Antonio,  and  Posey  For- 
mations of  Trask  and  Rolston  (see  table  2). 

Parts  of  the  older  bay  mud  contain  lenses  of  clayey 
sand,  pebbly  sand,  and  sandy  clay  from  5  to  50  feet 
chick.  The  thickness  of  the  older  bay  mud  unit  ranges 
from  less  than  a  foot  to  more  than  200  feet  and  ap- 
pears to  increase  toward  the  central  portion  of  the 
bay.  Along  the  margins,  the  older  bay  mud  unit  may 
be  missing. 

In  the  Islais  Creek  area,  the  clay-size  fraction  (minus 
2  microns)  has  been  described  by  Radbruch  and 
Schlocker  (1958)  as  containing  about  50  percent  nor- 
mal and  hydrated  mica  with  lesser  amounts  of  mont- 
morillonite,  chlorite,  diatoms,  carbonaceous  matter, 
quartz,  feldspar,  and  kaolinite.  The  silt  fraction  con- 
tains quartz,  feldspar,  lignitic  material,  mica,  and 
diatoms.  Sediments  of  similar  lithology  arc  being  de- 
posited presently  in  shallow,  relatively  still  waters 
where  the  tidal  action  is  weak  (Louderback,  1939, 
3.784). 

The  older  bay  mud  differs  in  physical  properties 
:rom  the  overlying  units.  Because  the  older  bay  mud 
s  more  deeply  buried,  it  contains  less  moisture,  and 
's  overconsolidated  (or  preconsolidated);  i.e.,  the  de- 
cree of  consolidation  is  greater  than  would  be  ex- 
pected from  the  weight  of  the  sediments  that  overlie 
:he  clay  today.  Preconsolidation  may  develop  from 


the  weight  of  overburden,  drying  upon  exposure  to 
air  after  deposition,  or  chemical  action.  Treasher 
(1963)  suggests  vibration  due  to  earthquakes  as  an- 
other mechanism. 

The  older  bay  mud  unit  presumably  was  deposited 
during  an  interglacial  period,  prior  to  the  advent  of 
the  Wisconsin  Glaciation  (late  Pleistocene  time), 
when  glacial  melt-water  raised  the  sea  level  so  as  to 
flood  the  San  Francisco  Bay  depression.  In  the  next 
glacial  stage  (Wisconsin  Glaciation),  the  sea  level  was 
lowered,  and  exposed  the  older  bay  mud  and  pre- 
sumably resulted  in  preconsolidation. 

Sand  Deposits 

A  distinctive  sand  unit  that  overlies  and  interfingers 
with  the  older  bay  mud  has  been  recognized  in  cer- 
tain portions  of  the  bay  underneath  younger  bay  mud. 
On  the  east  side  of  San  Francisco  bay,  a  fine  sand, 
10  to  50  feet  thick,  overlies  the  older  bay  mud  be- 
tween Point  Richmond  and  Bay  Farm  Island  (Trask 
and  Rolston,  1951).  The  sand  is  dissected  by  mud 
rilled  channels  and  is  overlain  by  younger  bay  mud 
from  0  to  35  feet  thick.  A  sand  layer  with  a  maximum 
thickness  of  50  feet  underlies  much  of  the  Islais  Creek 
Basin  (Radbruch  and  Schlocker,  1958).  This  sand  unit 
has  been  correlated  with  the  Alcrritt  Sand  of  Lawson. 

Sand  is  also  present  on  the  bay  floor  in  a  number 
of  shoal  areas  such  as  Point  Knox,  Presidio,  Southamp- 
ton, and  San  Bruno.  This  sand  grades  laterally  and 
vertically  into  sandy  silt  and  sandy  clay  and  may  have 
a  thin  cover  of  mud  over  it.  Logs  of  drilling  in  these

deposits  do  not  show  a  uniform  thickness  of  sand,  nor 
do  all  the  holes  show  sand  (U.  S.  Army  Corps  of 
Engineers,  1963,  p.37).  It  is  not  known  whether  these 
sand  deposits  are  correlative  with  the  Merritt  Sand,  or 
are  contemporaneous  in  age  with  the  younger  bay 
mud. 

The  known  distribution  of  the  sand  deposits  is  so 
erratic  that  no  attempt  has  been  made  in  this  study 
to  draw  contours  on  top  of  this  unit. 

Younger  Bay  Mud 

Younger  bay  mud  is  the  youngest  unit  in  San  Fran- 
cisco Bay,  overlying  the  older  bay  mud  and  (Merritt?) 
sand  unit,  and  covering  most  of  the  bay  bottom.  This 
unit,  which  consists  of  a  soft,  uniform,  gray,  silty 
clay  containing  45  to  95  percent  clay-size  particles, 
silt,  minor  fine  sand,  and  fragments  of  shells,  tends 
to  become  firmer  and  contain  less  water  with  increas- 
ing depth.  The  clay,  which  is  similar  to  the  clay  of 
the  older  bay  mud  unit  in  mineral  composition,  con- 
tains mica,  montmorillonite,  chlorite,  kaolinite,  quartz, 
and  feldspar.  The  clay  is  soft  and  plastic  when  wet, 
and  tends  to  shrink,  harden,  and  become  brittle  upon 
drying.  On  the  basis  of  engineering  properties, 
Treasher  (1963)  divides  the  younger  bay  mud  into  a 
lower  semiconsolidated  member  and  an  upper  soft 
member  above. 

The  younger  bay  mud  was  deposited  upon  an  ero- 
sional  surface  cut  to  depths  of  as  much  as  200  feet 
below  sea  level  in  the  older  bay  mud,  and  attains 
thicknesses  of  as  much  as  130  feet.  Contours  on  the 
bottom  of  the  younger  bay  mud  are  presented  on 
plate  3.  The  thickness  of  the  younger  bay  mud  is  pre- 
sented on  plate  4  and  figure  4. 

The  younger  bay  mud  was  formed  during  and  after 
the  melting  of  the  Wisconsin  continental  glaciers. 
Treasher  (1963)  postulates  at  least  three  stages  of 
flooding  and  two  stages  of  draining  the  bay  valley; 
with  the  first  flooding  to  allow  deposition  of  the  older 


bay  mud,  the  second  and  third  floodings  to  permit 
deposition  of  two  members  of  the  younger  bay  mud 
— one  now  semiconsolidated. 

Radiocarbon  dating  from  samples  in  the  youngei 
bay  mud  have  yielded  ages  ranging  from  7,360  years 
to  2,420  years  old  (Storey  et  al.,  1966). 

ENGINEERING  PROPERTIES  OF  THE  YOUNGER 
BAY  MUD 

Geologists  and  engineers  have  long  recognized  that 
from  the  soil  mechanics  and  foundation  engineering 
standpoints  the  younger  bay  mud  is  the  most  trouble- 
some of  the  sediments  of  the  bay.  The  foundation' 
problems  stem  from  the  nature  of  the  bay  mud,  which 
is  primarily  a  soft,  silty  clay.  The  clay  has  a  high 
natural  water  content,  is  quite  plastic  and  weak,  and 
highly  compressible.  These  properties  are,  in  a  large 
measure,  a  reflection  of  the  minerals  in  the  contained 
clays  which  swell  and  become  plastic  in  the  presence 
of  water. 

In  general,  the  unit  weight  and  strength  of  the 
younger  bay  mud  increases  with  depth  as  a  result  of 
the  increase  in  pressure  with  depth.  For  example,  in  a 
100-foot  interval,  the  average  water  saturated  weight 
will  increase  from  97  pounds  per  cubic  foot  to  110 
pounds  per  cubic  foot,  while  the  compressive  strength 
increases  from  200  pounds  per  square  foot  to  1,000 
pounds  per  square  foot.  These  and  other  properties 
are  described  and  compared  with  those  of  older  bay 
mud  in  table  3.  In  this  table,  the  younger  bay  mud 
has  been  subdivided  into  two  members  based  solely 
upon  the  engineering  properties:  a  soft  member,  and 
an  older  semiconsolidated  member  that  is  preconsok- 
dated  to  a  degree  greater  than  would  result  from  the 
weight  of  the  overlying  sediments.  The  amount  of 
preconsolidation  is  considerably  less  than  in  the  older 
bay  mud. 

In  detail  the  engineering  properties  vary  depending 
upon  the  thickness,  depth,  and  the  location  of  the  mud.

igure  A.     Thickness  of  the  younger  bay  mud 


The  main  engineering  problems,  which  arise  from 
le  low  strength  and  high  compressibility,  are  failure 
f  the  mud  due  to  imposed  load,  and  differential  settle- 
lents  (Mitchell,  1963).  Differential  settlement  results 
rom  variability  in  the  thickness  of  the  mud. 

When  younger  bay  mud  is  overloaded  by  fill,  it  be- 
omes  increasingly  unstable  as  the  height  of  the  fill 
lcreases  and,  if  the  slopes  on  the  edges  of  the  fill 
re  steep,  failure  ultimately  results.  During  construc- 


tion of  the  mole  fill  north  of  the  Toll  Plaza  of  the 
San  Francisco-Oakland  Bay  Bridge  in  1947,  the  mud 
was  overloaded  with  a  sand  fill  and  failed.  The  sand 
sank  20  feet  and  the  underlying  mud  was  forced 
laterally  for  more  than  500  feet. 

The  high  water  content,  low  strength,  and  high 
compressibility  cause  the  mud  to  consolidate  markedly 
under  sustained  loads.  At  the  mole  fill  mentioned 
above,  settlements  of  more  than  8  feet  took  place

during  the  first  20  years  after  construction.  The  settle- 
ment varied  almost  directly  with  the  thickness  of  the 
underlying  mud   (Trask  and  Rolston,   1951). 

The  mud  is  a  poor  formation  for  the  support  of 
friction  piles  and  it  is  necessary  to  carry  building  loads 
through  the  mud  to  firmer  strata  below.  Engineers 
attempt  to  place  piles  in  firm  beds  below  the  base  of 
the  mud. 


The  problem  of  seismic  effects  upon  unconsolidated 
sediments  has  been  known  to  geologists  and  engineers 
for  some  time  and  is  discussed  briefly  in  the  prior 
section  on  earthquakes,  and  in  the  accompanying  re- 
port by  Professor  Seed.  Because  of  the  low  strength 
and  high  water  content,  the  effects  of  shaking  during 
an  earthquake  are  more  pronounced  on  the  soft  muds 
than  on  more  consolidated  sediments  or  solid  rock.

Water-saturated  loose  sands  can  become  liquefied  and 
flow,  even  on  very  gentle  slopes,  or  can  subside,  com- 
pact, and  settle. 

The  seismic  effects  on  bay  muds  and  fills  on  bay 
mud  are  discussed  in  greater  detail  in  companion 
reports  by  Harry  B.  Seed,  and  Lee  and  Praszker. 
Seismic  effects  on  structures  built  on  bay  mud  are 
discussed  by  Karl  Steinbrugge  in  his  report. 

GROUND  WATER  CONSIDERATIONS 

Water-bearing  formations  (aquifers),  such  as  sand 
or  gravel  beds,  of  the  adjacent  land  extend  some  dis- 
tance into  the  bay  under  a  cover  of  bay  mud.  These 
formations  constitute  a  reservoir  of  fresh  water  under 
:he  salty  bay  waters. 

Ground  water  investigations  are  made  continuously 
jy  the  U.  S.  Geological  Survey  and  the  California 


Department  of  Water  Resources  to  determine  the  lo- 
cation and  extent  of  these  aquifers.  As  a  result  of  their 
studies,  it  has  been  shown  that  land  subsidence  may 
occur  in  areas  underlain  by  dense  clay  where  there  has 
been  excessive  pumping  and  drawdown  of  the  water 
levels.  This  has  already  occurred  in  the  vicinity  of 
San  Jose.  Another  effect  of  excessive  drawdown  has 
been  the  intrusion  of  salty  bay  waters  into  the  aquifer, 
destroying  it  as  a  source  of  fresh  water.  This  has 
occurred  in  the  Fremont  area. 

An  extensive  area  of  subsidence  has  been  delineated 
by  the  U.  S.  Geological  Survey  (Poland  and  Ireland, 
1968)  in  the  area  southeast  of  San  Francisco  Bay. 
Figure  5  shows  that  from  1934  to  1967,  (1)  the  ground 
level  in  the  vicinity  of  Palo  Alto  dropped  half  a  foot, 
(2)  the  general  area  including  Mountain  View,  Alviso, 
San  Jose  and  the  southern  tip  of  the  bay  subsided 
about  six  feet,  and  (3)  between  Mountain  View  and

Alviso,  and  near  San  Jose  a  drop  of  up  to  seven  feet 
was  recorded.  Longer  term  records  indicate  the  area 
around  San  Jose  has  subsided  13  feet  since  1912  to  the 
present  time.  Indications  are  that  if  heavy  ground 
water  pumping  is  continued  indefinitely  in  the  south 
bay  area,  the  bay  shore  in  the  Alviso  area  (which  has 
already  subsided  about  seven  feet  since  1912)  could 
subside  as  much  as  seven  more  feet,  requiring  exten- 
sive dikes  to  restrain  high  tides. 

Some  of  the  aquifers  underlying  the  bay  may  be 
damaged  if  the  mud,  which  acts  as  a  confining  layer 
over  an  aquifer,  is  removed  or  pierced  by  such  activi- 
ties as  dredging  or  penetration  by  bridge  piers.  Such 
damage  will  permit  salt  water  to  intrude  the  fresh 
water  aquifer.  If  the  damaged  aquifer  contained  arte- 
sian water,  it  would  flow  upward  under  artesian  pres- 
sure and  perhaps  cause  subsidence  of  the  surround- 
ing land  area. 

Data  are  not  available  to  postulate  the  inter-relation 
of  ground  water  depletion,  sea  water  intrusion,  and 
land  subsidence.  The  U.  S.  Geological  Survey  has  con- 
sidered a  ground  water  investigation  by  using  geo- 
physical techniques  to  delineate  the  ground  water 
aquifers  in  the  bay  as  an  adjunct  to  its  engineering 
geology  studies.  Continuing  work  by  the  State  De- 
partment of  Water  Resources  has  resulted  in  the  ac- 
cumulation of  basic  data.  However,  data  are  insuffi- 
cient to  determine  the  extent  and  thickness  of  all 
aquifers. 

While  most  cities  in  the  bay  area  are  now  served 
by  surface  water  supplies  from  several  aqueducts,  it 
appears  that  industrial  users  are  tapping  ground  water 
supplies  more  heavily  each  year.  While  municipal  use 
of  ground  water  in  the  south  bay  has  been  temporarily 
lessened  by  the  newest  aqueducts,  the  ground  water 
reservoir  there  will  probably  be  more  extensively 
tapped  in  the  future  as  the  need  for  water  increases. 

No  criteria  are  immediately  available  to  guide  deci- 
sions concerning  dredging  or  construction  in  the  bay 
that  might  penetrate  an  aquifer.  Prospective  developers 
considering  dredging  or  construction  that  would 
deeply  penetrate  the  mud  layers  should  be  required  to 
consult  the  State  Regional  Water  Quality  Control 
Board  and  the  State  Department  of  Water  Resources 
concerning  possible  damage  to  fresh  water  aquifers 
and  to  provide  additional  data  on  ground  water  con- 
ditions in  the  area  to  the  extent  necessary  and  reason- 
able in  relation  to  the  proposed  project. 

The  other  potential  problem,  salt  water  intrusion 
or  land  subsidence  as  a  result  of  excessive  ground  water 
withdrawal,  is  even  less  controllable  at  the  present 
time.  Restriction  on  water  pumping  is  now  possible 
only  through  court  action  by  injured  parties  or 
through  use  charges  which  water  districts  are  author- 
ized to  make.  More  direct  controls  now  appear  likely 
only  in  the  event  of  severe  threat  of  salt  water  intru- 
sion or  land  subsidence  when  present  methods  have 
failed  to  work. 

STATUS  OF  KNOWLEDGE  OF  BAY  GEOLOGY 
Available  Published  Data 
A  considerable  body  of  information  on  the  geology 
of  San  Francisco  Bay  exists  in  the  published  literature. 


The  prime  source  (which  was  used  as  a  basis  for  thi: 
report)  is  Appendix  E  of  the  U.  S.  Army  Corps  o) 
Engineers  Technical  report  on  San  Francisco  Bay  bar- 
riers (1963).  Other  published  reports  which  are  reliec 
upon  heavily  are  "Appendix  H,  Geology,"  in  th&lt; 
report  "Feasibility  of  construction  by  the  State  ol 
barriers  in  the  San  Francisco  bay  system"  by  the  Cali- 
fornia Division  of  Water  Resources  (1955),  and  ar- 
ticles bv  Trask  and  Rolston  (1951)  and  Treashei 
(1963). 

Unpublished  Data 

The  reports  mentioned  above  are  quite  general  anc 
too  all  encompassing  to  provide  the  detail  needed  foj 
an  engineering  project  at  a  specific  site.  There  is  stil 
a  woeful  lack  of  geologic  data  on  the  bay. 

A  major  concern  of  the  Bay  Conservation  and  De 
velopment  Commission  must  be  with  geologic  prob 
lems,  such  as  the  depth  to  bedrock,  thickness  of  mud 
location  of  sand,  for  which  data  can  be  obtained  onh 
through  subsurface  methods  such  as  borings  or  geo 
physical  techniques. 

The  preponderance  of  available  data  are  from  bor 
ings  located  on  the  margins  of  the  bay.  Most  of  thi 
borings  have  been  made  for  engineering  projects  sue! 
as  bridges,  harbors,  vehicular  crossings,  and  salt  wate: 
barriers.  Many  of  the  borings  were  drilled  no  deepe 
than  was  necessary  to  penetrate  the  younger  bay  mud 

The  deeper  borings  are  generally  those  that  havi 
been  made  in  connection  with  engineering  structure 
built  across  the  waters  of  the  bay  and  that  are  foundec 
upon  piles  driven  to  bedrock  or  to  firmer  sediments 
Such  borings  are  generally  on  alignments  for  the  pro 
posed  structure  and  reveal  information  only  along  tha 
line.  A  regional  picture  is  difficult  to  obtain  from  thesi 
random  locations  of  subsurface  information. 

The  concentration  of  sampling  areas  is  shown  ii 
figure  6.  Data  from  bore  holes  are  virtually  absent  ii 
San  Pablo  Bay,  except  for  scattered  shallow  boring 
and  for  water  wells  around  the  margins.  Thus,  firn 
correlations  between  sediments  in  San  Pablo  and  Sai 
Francisco  Bays  cannot  be  made.  Similarly,  the  subsur 
face  data  are  too  meager  in  Suisun  Bay  to  permit  cor 
relation  between  the  sediments  there  and  those  ii 
San  Francisco  Bay. 

The  bulk  of  the  drilling  records  is  scattered  through 
out  the  files  of  government  agencies  and  private  con 
cerns.  In  many  instances,  the  obligation  to  a  clien 
for  whom  the  sampling  was  done  prohibits  the  releas* 
of  the  data. 

Information  on  the  type  of  material  on  the  surfao 
of  the  bay  floor  is  also  quite  sketchy.  The  U.  S.  Coas 
and  Geodetic  Survey  attempts  to  sample  from  th&lt; 
bay  floor  as  it  takes  soundings  for  water  depths.  How 
ever,  these  are  small  and  therefore  inadequate  samples 
Dredge  companies  prospecting  for  sand  for  hydrauli 
fill  have  taken  surface  samples  from  known  sand  areas 
but  data  as  to  the  depths  of  sand  are  lacking,  or  ar 
kept  confidential  in  company  files. 

Some  geophysical  measurements  of  the  configuratioi 
of  the  bay  floor  and  underlying  bedrock  surface  hav&gt; 
been  made  for  various  purposes  such  as  cable  cross 
ings.  These  profiles  are  particularly  useful  when  the;  :, 
can  be  correlated  with  a  nearby  drill  hole.

Research  on  Bay  Geology 

vluch  of  the  present  research  on  the  geology  of  the 
i1'  is  being  conducted  by  federal  agencies:  the  U.  S. 
lological  Survey,  the  U.  S.  Bureau  of  Mines,  and 
i  U.  S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers. 


U.  S.  Bureau  of  Mines 

The  U.  S.  Bureau  of  Mines  is  conducting  oceano- 
graphic  research  on  the  feasibility  of  mining  minerals 
from  the  sea  floor,  at  its  Marine  Technology  Center 
at  Tiburon.  Most  of  the  work  is  in  developing  types

of  equipment  to  recover  minerals  from  the  sea  floor. 
Work  has  been  done  in  the  bay  to  perfect  the  equip- 
ment. As  a  corollary  to  the  testing  of  equipment,  the 
Bureau  has  attempted  to  coordinate  with  the  State 
Division  of  Bay  Toll  Crossings,  to  obtain  samples 
where  geologic  information  is  needed.  As  the  equip- 
ment is  designed  for  shallow  penetration  on  the  surface 
of  the  bay  floor,  this  type  of  research  would  not  sub- 
stitute for  the  deeper  borings  needed  for  geologic 
and  engineering  purposes. 

U.  S.  Geological  Survey 

The  U.  S.  Geological  Survey  at  Menlo  Park  has 
under  way  on  a  limited  basis  a  five-year  project,  en- 
titled "San  Francisco  Bay  Sediments  Engineering  Geol- 
ogy Studies,  California,"  with  an  estimated  completion 
date  in  1971.  The  objectives  of  this  study  are  to  evalu- 
ate the  relations  between  areal  distribution,  stratig- 
raphy, origin,  geologic  history,  physical  and  chemical 
characteristics  of  bay  sediments,  and  the  response  of 
bay  sediments  to  seismic  vibrations  and  their  potential 
for  landsliding  and  settlement  induced  by  seismic  vi- 
brations and  other  causes. 

The  study  will  entail  collection  and  synthesis  of 
available  data;  acoustical  sub-bottom  profiling;  field 
mapping;  soil  tests  in  the  field;  sampling  from  ship- 
board, obtaining  cores  40  feet  long  in  the  bay  sedi- 
ments; auger  sampling  to  100-foot  depths  inland;  and 
deep  coring.  Laboratory  investigations  will  be  made 
to  determine  mineralogy  and  soil  engineering  prop- 
erties. 

To  date,  the  program  has  been  in  the  data  com- 
pilation stage.  The  vessel  to  do  the  acoustical  sub- 
bottom  profiling  became  available  in  1966.  Laboratory 
equipment  has  been  purchased. 

If  this  program  proceeds  to  fruition,  the  project 
will  fill  a  gap  in  our  knowledge.  Whether  the  detail 
needed  for  specific  engineering  projects  will  be  pro- 
vided will  depend  largely  upon  the  frequency  of  sam- 
pling. 

U.  S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers 

As  a  continuation  of  its  monumental  undertaking 
for  the  bay  barrier  studies,  the  Corps  of  Engineers  has 
carried  forward  hydrologic  studies  in  the  bay,  but  has 
no  planned  geologic  program. 

California  Department  of  Water  Resources 

The  department  does  not  have  a  project  to  continue 
the  excellent  work  which  was  done  for  its  study  of 
salt  water  barriers  in  1955.  However,  since  the  opening 
of  an  office  in  Vallejo,  an  attempt  is  being  made  to 
compile  as  much  geologic  data  as  are  available  within 
its  district — which  includes  the  San  Francisco  Bay 
region.  The  original  compilation  of  borings  that  served 
as  the  basis  for  its  geologic  Appendix  H  to  the  barrier 
study  has  been  moved  to  the  Vallejo  office.  As  time 
and  money  permit,  the  department  will  continue  to 
collect  and  compile  data. 

SUMMARY 

During  the  geologic  events  that  led  to  the  formation 
of  the  present  bay,  hundreds  of  feet  of  soft,  relatively 


unconsolidated  sediments  accumulated  on  an  old  bed 
rock  surface.  Engineering  problems  associated  wit! 
filling  the  bay  as  urban  expansion  grows,  are  the  re- 
sult of  the  poor  foundation  characteristics  of  the  thicl 
layer  of  mud  or  silty  clay  that  underlies  the  botton 
and  margin  of  much  of  the  bay.  Variability  in  th&lt;( 
thickness  and  engineering  properties  of  the  mud,  i 
well  as  the  slope  and  configuration  of  the  bedrocl 
surface,  complicates  the  difficulty  in  engineering  fills 

The  bay  is  bounded  by  seismically  active  faults  am 
can  be  expected  to  experience  strong  earthquakes.  Th», 
soft,  water-bearing  sediments,  such  as  the  bay  mud 
may  be  expected  to  react  strongly  to  such  earthquake 
generated  shocks. 

Sources  of  hydraulic  sand  fill  are  limited  to  the  shoa 
areas  in  the  bay;  the  prime  source  is  a  large  sand  ba: 
outs'de  the  Golden  Gate.  Land  fill  is  obtained  from  :, 
number  of  quarries  that  border  the  bay. 

The  geology  of  the  recent  sediments  in  the  bay  ij 
far  from  completely  known.  Thickness  and  exten. 
of  the  geologic  formations  (some  of  which  are  grounc 
water  reservoirs)  underlying  the  waters  of  the  bay  an; 
known  only  through  limited  boring  reports,  many  0: 
which  are  highly  unreliable,  or  are  held  in  confidentia 
files. 

CONCLUSION 

Every  day  new  raw  data  are  developed  that  pertaii 
to  the  geology  of  the  bay  sediments  and  their  physica 
and  engineering  properties.  Although  the  Californii 
Department  of  Water  Resources  and  the  U.  S.  Arm) 
Corps  of  Engineers  have  accumulated  data  on  a  spo 
radic  basis  for  their  barrier  studies,  there  has  neve 
been  an  attempt  to  collect,  compile,  evaluate,  anc 
analyze  these  data  systematically  on  a  continuing  basis 

Reliability  of  the  data  that  are  available  varies  almos 
as  much  as  the  natural  materials  themselves.  The  diffi 
culty  in  correlation  between  bore  holes  is  compounder 
by  the  variety  of  ways  in  which  the  materials  art 
described,  generally  by  drillers — not  by  geologists;  anc' 
by  the  absence  of  accompanying  engineering  test  re 
suits. 

Generally,  the  firms  that  conduct  foundation  studie 
in  the  bay  area  draw  on  results  from  their  own  fill 
of  test  borings  on  prior  sites.  Reports  of  the  Depart 
ment  of  Water  Resources  and  the  Corps  of  Engineer 
do  not  provide  them  with  the  detail  essential  for  a  spe 
cific  site  study. 

There  is  still  much  to  be  learned  about  the  fabric 
mineralogy,  and  physical  chemistry  of  clays  and  thei) 
relation  to  engineering  behavior.  Research  is  needec 
in  soils  engineering  through  simulated  earthquake-load 
ing  tests,  and  changes  in  strength-on-shearing  tests,   j 

The  need  exists  for  a  state  agency  to  serve  as  a  cen 
tral  clearing  house  for  all  the  basic  geologic  data  01 
the  bay.  The  work  of  securing  and  compiling,  begui 
by  the  Department  of  Water  Resources  and  continuec 
by  the  Corps  of  Engineers,  should  be  carried  forward 
A  central  file  of  boring  logs  should  be  kept,  perhap; 
programmed  on  computers  so  that  data  can  be  re 
trieved  readily  for  a  specific  area.  Maps  showing  th&lt; 
configuration  of  the  bedrock,  the  thickness  of  ba) 
mud,  and  the  location  of  sand  deposits,  should  be  kep; 
current  as  new  holes  are  drilled.  There  is  also  a  neec

:or  an  aggressive  program  to  obtain  new  data  by  drill- 
ng  and  sampling,  and  by  geophysical  methods. 

RECOMMENDATIONS 

1.  A  State  agency  should  be  designated  and  funded  to 
Pursue  actively  the  collecting,  compiling,  and  analyzing  of 
lata  on  the  geology  of  San  Francisco  Bay,  on  the  engi- 
leering  properties  of  bay  sediments,  and  on  the  ground 
vater  conditions.  This  agency  should  conduct  laboratory 
esting,  core  drilling,  and  geophysical  surveys,  in  coopera- 
lon  with  other  state  and  federal  agencies,  particularly  the 
J.S.  Geological  Survey,  on  a  matching  fund  or  participating 
&gt;asis,  so  that  efforts  can  be  coordinated  and  reinforced. 

2.  Until  such  time  as  such  an  agency  is  designated,  the 
division  of  Mines  and  Geology  should  be  retained  to  act 
is  the  geologic  consultants  to  the  Bay  Conservation  and 
)evelopment  Commission  on  the  level  of  about  $20,000  a 
'ear,  to  conduct  studies  necessary  to  provide  the  engineer- 
ig  geology  data  needed  to  evaluate  proposed  fill  de- 
'elopments,  and  to  add  new  data  to  that  in  this  report. 
1  3.  The  Bay  Conservation  and  Development  Commission 
hould  require  applicants  for  fill  permits  to  obtain  the 
jeologic  data  necessary  for  sound  foundation  engineering 

esign,  including  core  holes  and/or  geophysical  surveys; 
ind  require  that  such  data  be  transmitted  to  the  Division 
&gt;f  Mines  and  Geology,  where  it  will  serve  to  build  up  the 
ecord  and  be  available  for  public  reference. 

4.  The  Bay  Conservation  and  Development  Commission 
hould  request  the  State  Division  of  Oil  and  Gas  to  require 
in  electric  log  and  if  available,  the  core  log  of  the  recent 
nconsolidated  sediments  in  any  oil  test  well  drilled  in  or 
ear  the  bay;  and  such  data  should  be  transmitted  to  the 
&gt;ivision  of  Mines  and  Geology. 

5.  The  Bay  Conservation  and  Development  Commission 
hould  require  applicants  for  dredging  or  construction 
/hich  deeply  penetrates  the  mud  over  possible  fresh  water 
quifers  under  the  bay  to  consult  the  Regional  Water 
Jualiry  Control  Board  and  the  State  Department  of 
Vater  Resources  concerning  possible  damage  to  fresh 
rater  aquifers  and  to  provide  additional  data  on 
round  water  conditions  in  the  area  to  the  extent  neces- 
ary  and  reasonable  in  relation  to  the  proposed  project.

SALT,   SAND,    AND   SHELLS 

Mineral  Resources  of  San  Francisco  Bay 

By  Harold  B.  Goldman 


INTRODUCTION 

San  Francisco  Bay  is  an  important  area  of  mineral 
oduction.  The  mineral  commodities  produced  from 
e  bay  include  sand,  saline  minerals  (salt,  magnesium 
mpounds,  bromine,  and  gypsum),  and  shells  and 
ly  for  use  in  cement.  In  1965,  the  value  of  these

|:nt  Commission  has  been  charged  with  preparing  a 
Imprehensive  plan  for  the  orderly  development  of 
li  Francisco  Bay.  One  of  the  integral  features  of 
I  plan  will  be  to  develop  an  understanding  of  the 
plogic  factors  that  relate  to  urban  development.  The 
blogy  of  San  Francisco  Bay  is  discussed  in  a  com- 
mon report. 

The  purpose  of  this  report  is  to  provide  the  Bay 
Inservation  and  Development  Commission  with  gen- 
ii information  on  the  mineral  resources  of  the  bay 
cthat  it  can  establish  guidelines  for  future  develop- 
:nt  in  the  bay. 

The  section  on  shell  resources  was  adapted  from  a 
plication  by  Earl  W.  Hart  (1966),  while  the  section 
i  salines  was  adapted  from  reports  bv  the  late  Wil- 
sn  E.  Ver  Planck  (1951). 

SAND 

and  is  an  important  source  of  hydraulic  fill  in  San 
incisco  Bay,  and  occurs  in  or  immediately  adjacent 
3:xisting  current  channels  at  a  number  of  places  be- 
*en  the  confluence  of  the  Sacramento  and  San  Joa- 
li  Rivers  and  in  the  Golden  Gate.  The  largest  area 
f  and  is  on  the  bay  floor  between  Point  San  Quentin 
I  the  city  of  San  Francisco,  but  deep  water  pre- 
I'les  production  from  much  of  this  area.  The  general 
i:ribution  of  sand  on  the  bay  floor  is  shown  on 
gre  1. 

i  general,  the  areas  from  which  sand  is  being  exca- 
i!d  are  operated  under  lease  from  the  State  Lands 
Amission  and  are  the  shoal  areas:  Point  Knox  Shoal 
nhwest  of  Angel  Island,  Presidio  and  Alcatraz  Shoals 
'«:  and  southwest  of  Alcatraz,  Southampton  Shoal 
iihwest  of  Point  Richmond,  and  San  Bruno  Shoal. 
1   largest  potential   source   of  sand   is   outside   the 


Golden  Gate  on  the  semicircular  Golden  Gate  bar. 
Sedimentation  on  the  Golden  Gate  bar  has  been  dis- 
cussed by  Smith  (1965). 

The  long  term  movement  of  sediments  in  the  bay 
has  been  the  subject  of  a  number  of  excellent  works. 
Gilbert  (1917)  and  Smith  (1965)  postulated  that  the 
Golden  Gate  bar  is  composed  of  sand  eroded  from  the 
coast.  Moore  (1965),  in  a  mineralogical  study,  con- 
cluded that  the  bar  was  derived  from  the  sand  channel 
in  San  Francisco  Bay  west  of  Carquinez  and  that  long- 
shore transport  along  this  portion  of  the  California 
coast  is  only  of  local  importance  at  the  present  time. 

Other  sand  deposits  that  have  been  dredged,  mainly 
as  sources  of  fill,  lie  beneath  a  cover  of  younger  bay 
mud.  The  bulk  of  this  sand  is  on  the  east  side  of  San 
Francisco  Bay  between  Point  Richmond  and  Bay  Farm 
Island.  This  sand  lens  is  dissected  in  several  places  by 
mud-filled  channels  and  may  extend  southward  beyond 
Bay  Farm  Island.  The  amount  of  information  available 
is  too  meager  to  permit  an  estimate  of  the  quantity 
of  sand  available  from  this  deposit. 

The  depth  limit  of  economic  dredging  for  most 
projects  is  currently  45  to  60  feet;  the  average  depth 
worked  on  the  shoals  is  35  feet  below  the  water  sur- 
face. The  most  feasible  way  of  mining  sand  is  by 
suction  dredge  which  loads  into  a  hopper  barge. 
Dredging  costs  about  30^  a  cubic  yard.  Cost  of  hy- 
draulic filling  ranges  from  60^  to  $1.50  a  cubic  yard — 
dredged,  transported,  and  placed.  The  costs  depend 
upon  the  amount  of  materials  to  be  handled  and 
whether  or  not  the  disposal  area  is  nearby.  Bay  mud 
used  as  fill  ranges  from  60^  to  $1.00  per  cubic  yard 
placed;  sand  from  $1.00  to  $1.50  placed.  Estimates  of 
quantities  of  available  hydraulic  fill  were  made  by  the 
California  Division  of  Water  Resources  (1955),  later 
modified  by  the  U.  S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers 
(1963)  and  are  presented  in  table  1.  As  these  estimates 
are  based  upon  extremely  limited  subsurface  data,  they 
must  be  considered  as  preliminary. 

The  sands  in  the  bay  have  a  limited  potential  for 
higher  uses  other  than  as  hydraulic  fill,  such  as  aggre- 
gate in  paving  mixtures  and  in  concrete,  or  even  for 
beaches.  Approximately  five  million  tons  of  sand  are

bounty,  or  Seaside,  Monterey  Canyon.  Sand  is  a  low 
ost  commodity  that  sells  for  fl  to  $2  per  ton 
'.O.B.  the  plant,  and  as  such  cannot  be  transported 
ny  great  distances  before  the  cost  of  transportation 
quals  or  exceeds  the  price  paid  at  the  plant.  The  pres- 
nt  truck  haul  is  about  30  miles  and  may  be  increased 
3  43  miles  when  the  closest  source  is  depleted. 

The  amount  of  sand  in  the  bay  available  for  future 
se  is  not  precisely  known.  The  current  rate  of  use 
oes  not  suggest  that  bay  sources  will  be  depleted 
apidly  nor  that  stringent  conservation  measures  are 
rgent  pending  a  more  exact  analysis  of  the  supply. 

There  is  no  indication  of  when  it  will  be  of  eco- 
omic  interest  to  develop  a  source  of  high  quality  sand 
l  the  bay.  The  difficulties  in  producing  such  a  sand 
)day  are  (1)  problem  of  obtaining  the  proper  size 
radation  since  the  sand  at  each  locality  differs  in  size 
inge;  and  (2)  the  sand  must  be  washed  thoroughly 
id  screened,  and  the  abundant  shell  fragments  re- 
loved.  The  sands  in  the  bay  are  predominantly  poorly 
raded   (well-sorted),  fine-to-medium-grained  with  a 

edian  diameter  of  150  to  500  microns  (100  to  40 
esh)  (U.  S.  Army,  Corps  of  Engineers,  1963,  plate 
&gt;).  Pit  sand  deposits  are  likely  to  be  largely  ex- 
msted  before  bay  sources  become  economically 
asible.

Iher  Sources  of  Fill 

While  not  a  mineral  resource  in  the  bay  itself,  the 
oining  geologic  formations  in  the  foothills  sur- 
unding  the  bay  constitute  potential  sources  of  land 
i£  There  are  a  number  of  commercial  quarries  that 
[jig  the  bay  at  which  stone  is  produced  for  use  as  fill 
cot  the  marginal  lands.  The  major  suppliers  of  broken 
(trie  for  use  as  riprap  are  at  Napa;  Brisbane,  San 


Mateo  County;  McNears  Point  in  Marin  County;  and 
Point  Richmond  in  Contra  Costa  County.  Other  quar- 
ries produce  crushed  stone;  all  produce  fill  material. 
In  1965,  the  total  production  of  stone  in  these  coun- 
ties exceeded  9  million  tons. 

Another  source  of  fill  material  arises  as  a  conse- 
quence of  grading  in  hills  for  land  development.  In 
San  Mateo  and  Alameda  Counties,  millions  of  cubic 
yards  of  material  have  been  removed  by  grading  con- 
tractors over  the  years  from  the  foothills,  and  used 
on  the  flat  lands  below.

Nearly  all  of  the  geologic  formations  on  the  margins 
of  the  bay  are  potential  sources  of  fill  when  there  is 
an  excess  of  material  as  a  result  of  cut  and  fill  grading 
operations;  and  this  would  be  a  major  source  of  the 
land  fill  for  the  bay  margins.  The  amount  of  material 
available  from  commercial  quarries  would  be  more 
expensive,  costing  from  50^  to  $1.00  a  ton,  F.O.B. 
the  quarry,  and  limited  in  quantity  because  the  future 
expansion  of  quarries  is  rigidly  controlled  by  zoning 
ordinances.  The  geological  formations  that  could  pro- 
vide rock  fill  are  shown  on  figure  1  in  the  geology 
report. 

It  is  difficult  to  determine  the  amount  of  material 
that  is  economically  available  as  land  fill.  Estimates 
made  by  the  Corps  of  Engineers  are  presented  in 
table  2. 

Most  of  San  Francisco  Bay  is  very  shallow.  Dis- 
regarding problems  of  placing  fill  upon  mud,  it  would 
be  at  least  theoretically  possible  to  fill  the  bay  from 
the  land  sources.  Rough  calculations  based  on  the 
Corps  of  Engineers'  data  indicate  10  billion  cubic 
yards  of  fill  would  be  sufficient  to  replace  all  the 
water  in  the  bay  system. 

SHELL  DEPOSITS  OF  SOUTHERN  SAN  FRANCISCO  BAY  ' 

Late  Quaternary  oyster  shell  deposits,  which  are 
exposed  over  a  large  portion  of  southern  San  Fran- 
cisco Bay,  constitute  an  important  but  not  widely 
known  mineral  resource.  Nowhere  else  in  the  bays  of 
California  are  such  extensive  accumulations  of  shells

known.  Although  oyster  shells  from  San  Francisco 
Bay  were  used  in  a  limited  way  at  least  as  early  as 
1891  for  garden  walks  and  other  purposes,  there  was 
no  concentrated  effort  to  develop  the  shell  deposits 
until  1924.  In  that  year  Agricultural  Lime  and  Com- 
post Company  (now  Bay  Shell  Company)  began 
dredging  and  processing  the  shells  for  livestock  feed 
and  soil  conditioner.  The  same  year,  Pacific  Portland 
Cement  Company  constructed  a  plant  at  Redwood 
City  to  utilize  oyster  shells  as  the  basic  raw  material 
in  cement  manufacture.  Cement  production  began  in 
1925.  Thereafter,  three  other  companies  commenced 
dredging  shells  from  the  bay  and,  from  1931  to  about 
1950,  the  calcining  of  shells  to  make  lime  became  im- 
portant. The  lime  was  used  mainly  to  produce  mag- 
nesium compounds  by  reacting  the  lime  with  bitterns 
from  salt  works,  but  a  little  was  sold  commercially. 
Shells  are  no  longer  used  for  lime,  but  they  are  still 
utilized  for  cement,  livestock  feed  and  soil  condition- 
ing. As  far  as  the  records  show  there  have  been  only 
six  producers  and  major  processors  of  shell  from  San 
Francisco  Bay  since  1924.  The  activities  of  these  oper- 
ators are  summarized  in  table  3.  In  1964,  the  active 
shell  producers  were  Ideal  Cement  Company,  Pioneer 
Shell  Company,  and  South  Bay  Dredging  Company. 
The  entire  production  of  the  last  company  is  sold  to 
Bay  Shell  Company  for  processing.  Since  Shellmaker, 
Inc.,  ceased  operations  in  1962  at  Newport  Bay, 
Orange  County,  the  above  companies  are  the  only 
shell  dredgers  active  in  California. 


Occurence  of  Shells 

Even  though  the  shell  deposits  of  south  San  Frai 
cisco  Bay  have  been  important  mineral  resources  f&lt; 
many  years,  little  systematic  effort  has  been  made 
explore   (mainly  through  drilling  and  sampling)   f&lt; 
new  deposits.  Consequently,  much  of  the  knowledj 
regarding  the  distribution,  character  and  reserves  J 
shells  is  based  on  indirect  evidence  or  on  informatk| 
obtained  from  studies  not  directly  related  to  the  undej 
standing  of  shell  deposits.  For  example,  the  distributk 
of  shells  in  the  bay  floor  is  known  only  in  a  gener 
way — and  this  knowledge  is  based  mainly  on  botto 
sediment  data  shown  on  nautical  charts  of  the  U. 
Coast  and  Geodetic  Survey. 

Although  the  charts  do  not  reveal  the  subsurfai 
extent  or  continuity  of  the  shell  beds,  they  do  sho 
that  the  shells  tend  to  accumulate  with  soft  mud 
shallow  protected  shelf  areas  of  the  bay  where  tid 
currents  are  weak.  The  general  location  of  shell  be 
is  shown  in  figure  1.  It  seems  likely  that  the  shell  debi 
exposed  on  the  bay  floor  largely  represents  a  rece 
"population  explosion"  of  the  oyster.  Presumably,  tl 
slightly  older,  buried  shells  accumulated  under  simil 
circumstances  and,  to  that  extent,  the  surface  accum 
lations  provide  insight  as  to  the  location  of  subsurfai 
deposits. 

Added   information   of  the   subsurface   occurren 
of  shells  is  provided  by  the  hundreds  of  engineerir, 
borings  made  in  the  bay.  Unfortunately,  the  logs 
borings  are  of  such  variable  quality  that  it  often

ifficult  to  ascertain  the  amount — or  even  the  pres- 
nce — of  shells  encountered  in  bore  holes.  Neverthe- 
:ss,  bore  hole  data  show  that  (1)  the  shells  occur 
lainly  as  numerous  thin  lenses  that  individually  do 
ot  extend  very  far  laterally;  (2)  shell  lenses  occur  at 
arious  stratigraphic  horizons  in  soft  bay  mud — but 
lainly  in  the  upper  30  feet  of  bay  sediments;  (3)  the 
reas  of  surface  accumulation  shown  on  the  map  do 
ot  directly  reflect  the  presence  of  shells  at  depth;  and 
4)  buried  shell  deposits  occur  in  some  places  outside 
f  known  surface  shell  accumulations. 
The  principal  shell  deposits  are  part  of  a  soft  mud 
nit  which  contains  the  youngest  sediments  deposited 
l  San  Francisco  Bay. 

In  addition  to  the  shells  associated  with  soft  bay 
md,  there  are  relatively  pure  shell  beaches  and  banks 
sposed  in  some  tidal  areas  of  San  Francisco  Bay. 
"hese  modern  deposits  are  temporary  and  small,  and 
lerefore  are  considered  to  be  only  minor  commercial 
)urces  of  shells.  Sharp  decline  of  the  oyster  popula- 
on,  coupled  with  wave  erosion,  is  believed  to  have 
?duced  the  size  and  extent  of  the  shell  beaches  and 
inks  in  recent  decades.  Concentrations  of  shells  in 
der  preconsolidated  bay  mud  also  occur,  but  such 
^posits  appear  to  be  too  small  and  too  deeply  buried 
•  be  of  commercial  value.  Broken  shells — perhaps  de- 
ved  largely  from  clams — also  are  associated  with  a 
^-foot  thick  sand  zone  under  bay  mud  at  San  Bruno 
loal,  but  the  percentage  of  shells  in  the  sand  appears 
be  too  small  to  be  of  economic  interest.  However, 
oken  shells  associated  with  sand  in  the  shoal  areas  of 
n  Francisco  Bay  north  of  San  Francisco  may  have 
tmmercial  possibilities.  It  is  conceivable  that  the 
iarse  shell  debris  could  be  easily  separated  from  the 
ad  by  screening. 

Composition  of  Shell  Deposits 

Virtually  all  of  the  shell  debris  associated  with  the 

ft  bay  mud  and  the  modern  beach  deposits  is  de- 

'ed  from  the  native  oyster,  Ostrea  lurida  Carpenter, 

widespread  and  prolific  bivalve.  This  oyster,  which 

oduces  a  rather  flat  and  very  thin  shell,  seldom  more 

an  2  Yz  inches  long,  previously  lived  in  extensive  beds 

the  tidal  and  shallow  water  areas  all  around  the 

rath  arm  of  San  Francisco  Bay  (see  Skinner,   1962, 

100,    163,   PI.    3).   Increasing  pollution   in  recent 

cades  apparently  has  so  decimated  the  native  oyster 

pulation  that  live  oysters  are  now  relatively  diffi- 

tt  to   find   in   San   Francisco   Bay.   In   addition   to 

sters,  the  bay  mussel  and  a  few  other  mollusks  com- 

se  up  to  a  few  percent  of  the  shell  deposits.  The 

[htly  worn  and  broken  condition  of  the  shells  in- 

ates  that  the  shells  were  transported  short  distances 

fm  their  original  environment  or  at  least  redistrib- 

d  prior  to  deposition. 

?ew  analyses  are  available  to  indicate  the  chemical 
nposition  of  the  shell  deposits.  However,  some  idea 
Khe  chemistry  is  indicated  by  a  sample  composed  of 
lwashed  shells  and  associated  mud  obtained  from  an 
teal  Cement  Company  barge.  The  sample  is  a  product 
Whydraulic  dredging  and  no  doubt  is  higher  in  lime 
v*iO),  45  percent,  than  the  original  in-place  sample 
h  to  the  inherent  washing  effect  of  the  dredging 


process.  Samples  which  have  been  washed  but  are  not 
entirely  free  of  mud,  show  54  percent  lime.  It  seems 
likely  that  more  thorough  washing  would  result  in  a 
product  relatively  high  in  lime. 

Production 

It  is  estimated  that  roughly  30  million  tons  of  shells 
have  been  dredged  from  San  Francisco  Bay  since  1924. 
The  great  bulk  of  this  was  used  to  manufacture  ce- 
ment. Most  of  the  shells  were  dredged  from  the 
vicinity  of  the  San  Mateo  Bridge  east  of  the  main  ship 
channel.  Some  dredging  also  is  reported  to  have  taken 
place  south  of  the  Dumbarton  Bridge.  No  other  shell 
dredging  areas  are  known  to  this  writer.  Recent  dredg- 
ing operations  have  been  carried  out  principally,  if  not 
solely,  to  the  north  of  the  San  Mateo  Bridge  causeway. 
All  current  dredgers  employ  hydraulic  methods.  Pio-

pany work  in  shallow  waters  (maximum  dredging 
depth  of  10  to  11  feet)  and  wash  shells  aboard  their 
dredges.  The  washed  shells  are  barged  to  processing 
plants  in  Petaluma  (Sonoma  County)  and  Alviso 
(Santa  Clara  County),  where  the  shells  are  dried  and 
pulverized  for  use  as  poultry  and  cattle  feed  or  in 
soil  conditioning.  Ideal  Cement  Company  operates 
nearby  in  slightly  deeper  water  and  barges  the  un- 
washed shells  directly  to  their  Redwood  City  cement 
plant.  There  the  shells  and  adhering  mud  are  used, 
along  with  some  washed  shells  and  other  raw  mate- 
rials, to  manufacture  cement. 

Reserves 

Reserves  of  shells  in  southern  San  Francisco  Bay  are 
not  determinable  as  information  on  boundaries,  average 
thickness  and  content  (grade)  of  the  various  deposits 
is  not  available.  However,  by  making  certain  assump- 
tions regarding  the  size  and  grade  of  the  deposits, 
some  idea  of  reserves  can  be  obtained.  For  example, 
a  hypothetical  deposit  four  miles  long  by  three  miles 
wide,  with  shell  beds  having  an  average  aggregate 
thickness  of  five  feet  (mud  interbeds  excluded)  and 
containing  an  average  composition  of  70  percent  shells, 
would  contain  approximately  75,000,000  tons  of  shells. 
Although  the  grade  and  average  thickness  of  the  large 
shell  accumulation  exposed  on  the  east  side  of  San 
Francisco  Bay  is  unknown,  its  areal  extent  is  much 
greater  than  the  assumed  example  and  shell  reserves 
may  be  very  large.  The  deposits  along  the  west  side 
of  the  bay  seem  to  be  considerably  smaller  in  area, 
but  nonetheless  may  contain  substantial  shell  reserves. 
If  the  above  assumptions  are  reasonable,  then  available 
shell  reserves  appear  to  be  quite  adequate  to  support 
current  shell  operations  for  many  years  to  come. 

Economics 

The  shell  deposits  of  San  Francisco  Bay  are  actually 
thin,  low  grade,  unconsolidated  to  weakly  consolidated 
limestone  deposits,  that  would  be  far  less  valuable  (or 
even  useless)  if  located  onshore.  Some  of  the  advan- 
tages enjoyed  by  the  shell  operators  include:  (1) 
simple  inexpensive  mining  by  dredging;  (2)  ability  to 
beneficiate  the  shells  inexpensively  by  washing  with

bay  water;  (3)  use  of  the  clay  in  the  "mud"  as  a 
source  of  raw  materials  (alumina,  silica,  iron  oxide)  in 
the  manufacture  of  cement;  (4)  flexibility  and  low 
cost  in  transportation  of  products  to  a  large  marketing 
area;  and  (5)  low  land  cost,  especially  for  an  urban 
location. 

The  disadvantages  associated  with  shell  development 
are  not  always  obvious,  but  generally  relate  to  mul- 
tiple use  and  multiple  jurisdiction  of  the  bay.  The 
problems  that  can  develop  when  dredging,  land 
filling,  shipping,  sport  and  commercial  fishing,  and 
various  recreational  activities  are  all  carried  on  in 
close  proximity  to  one  another  are  manifold.  The 
varied  activities  and  areas  of  the  bay  are  managed  by 
a  large  number  of  authorities  and  land  owners. 

Land  ownership  in  south  San  Francisco  Bay  is  com- 
plex, and  mineral  rights  to  large  areas  are  owned  both 
publicly  and  privately.  The  State  of  California  owns 
most  of  the  public  land,  but  some  land  is  held  by  cities 
and  other  government  jurisdictions.  The  second  larg- 
est private  owner,  Ideal  Cement  Company,  reportedly 
controls  about  30,000  acres  of  bay  land  between  Mill- 
brae  and  Alviso.  The  approximate  distribution  of  lands 
owned  by  Ideal  are  indicated  in  Scott  (1963,  chart  op- 
posite p.  4)  as  lands  patented  by  Surveyor  General. 
Additionally,  some  state-owned  land  is  leased  by  Ideal 
Cement  Company  for  the  purpose  of  shell  dredging. 
Other  state  leases  permit  the  dredging  of  sand  and 
gravel. 

In  most  other  places  outside  the  bay  area,  raw 
materials  used  in  the  manufacture  of  cement  are  ordi- 
narily obtained  from  limestone  quarries  where  the 
rock  is  drilled,  blasted,  crushed,  and  ground.  In  addi- 
tion to  the  bay  shells,  major  deposits  of  limestone  in 
the  bay  area  are  used  in  the  manufacture  of  cement. 
These  are  located  at  the  Kaiser  Cement  and  Gypsum 
Corporation's  operation  at  Permanente  in  Santa  Clara 
County,  the  Lone  Star  Cement  Company's  operation 
near  Davenport  in  Santa  Cruz  County,  and  the  San 
Juan  Bautista  operation  in  San  Benito  County.  Accel- 
erated depletion  of  the  shell  deposits  would  be  re- 
flected in  the  accelerated  depletion  of  these  nearby 
limestone  deposits. 

A  local  supply  of  raw  materials  for  cement  is  a 
critical  economic  necessity.  Cement  is  a  low  priced 
commodity  and  transportation  cost  is  high  in  relation 
to  its  value,  so  that  cement  cannot  be  transported 
economically  over  great  distances,  except  by  water. 
According  to  Ideal  Cement  Company,  approximately 
nine  million  barrels  of  cement  are  consumed  annually 
in  the  bay  area.  The  capacity  of  their  plant  using 
shells  is  2.5  million  barrels  per  year.  Not  only  is  Ideal 
therefore  a  major  producer  in  the  bay  area,  but  it  is 
also  the  closest  producer  to  the  market  it  serves.  Ac- 
cording to  its  recent  application  to  the  Bay  Conserva- 
tion and  Development  Commission  for  a  new  dredging 
permit,  the  company  has  dredged  between  1.5  and  2 
million  cubic  yards  of  shells  and  mud  per  year  and 
expects  to  increase  to  2.5  million  yards  within  the 
next  few  years. 

Should  the  oyster  shells  be  lost  as  a  local  source  of 
raw  materials  for  use  in  the  manufacture  of  cement, 
the  possibility  of  a  slight  price  rise  to  the  consumer 
exists  but  hardly  seems  probable  in  view  of  today's 


competitive  market.  Nevertheless,  in  the  interest 
good  resource  management,  this  valuable  mineral  d 
posit  should  be  conserved  and  ultimately  utilized  in 
planned  and  orderly  fashion.  Because  most  of  tl 
known  shell  deposits  are  in  shallow  waters  which  ? 
most  vulnerable  to  filling;  filling  in  the  areas  indicatr 
should  be  avoided  until  the  shell  resource  is  extracte 

The  unavailability  of  the  oyster  shells  would  resi 
in  a  severe  loss  of  two  other  operations  that  rely  up( 
the  use  of  crushed  shell  as  poultry  grit.  The  chick| 
growers  and  the  egg  producers  depend  upon  tl 
nearby  source  of  calcium  and  would  have  to  impc 
shells  from  southern  California  at  additional  expen: 

Thus  not  only  the  cement  industry  but  also  t 
poultry  grit  industry  would  be  seriously  affect'

SALINES  IN  THE  BAY  AREA1 

Salines  in  the  bay  area  are  derived  entirely  from  s 
water.  Common  salt,  magnesium  compounds,  artific 
gypsum,  and  bromine  valued  at  over  $11  million,  we 
produced  in  1965.  The  salt  refineries  of  the  Leslie  S; 
Company  are  located  at  Newark,  and  the  ponds  f 
harvesting  the  crude  salt  cover  the  marshes  for  mai 
miles  along  the  shores  of  southern  San  Francisco  B 
and  San  Pablo  Bay.  Inorganic  Chemical  Division  of  t 
Food  Machinery  and  Chemical  Corporation  also  ope 
ates  a  plant  in  Newark  in  which  are  recovered  ma 
nesium  compounds,  gypsum,  and  bromine  from  b 
tern,  the  waste  product  of  salt  recovery.  These  mine] 
products  of  the  sea  are  sold  throughout  the  northwe 

Salt  has  been  produced  from  sea  water  since  t 
dawn  of  history,  but  San  Francisco  Bay  is  one  of  t 
few  places  where  age-old  methods  have  been  perfect* 
Sea  water  contains  on  the  average  3.45  percent  sal 
San  Francisco  Bay  is  slightly  diluted  with  fresh  wat 
and  contains  only  about  2.8  percent  salts.  These  sa 
are,  in  grams  per  liter:  sodium  chloride,  21.695;  maj 
nesium  chloride,  2.619;  magnesium  sulfate,  1.842;  ci 
cium  sulfate,  0.981;  potassium  chloride,  0.534;  calciul 
bicarbonate,  0.152;  and  potassium  bromide,  0.079. 

The  great  problem  is  to  extract  sodium  chloride  wi 
a  minimum   of  other  salts.   Magnesium  salts  have! 
bitter  taste;  they  are  highly  deliquescent,  as  are  c 
cium  salts,  tending  to  stay  wet. 

If  a  quantity  of  sea  water  is  evaporated  the  le;| 
soluble  salts  will,  in  general,  be  precipitated  first.  Whj 
the  volume  has  been  reduced  to  one-half,  calcium  at 
bonate,  magnesium  carbonate,  and  ferric  oxide  beg  j 
to  precipitate.  At  17  percent  of  the  original  volurr 
these  materials  are  completely  removed  from  solutai 
and  gypsum  begins  to  form.  When  the  volume  reach 
nine  percent  of  the  original  most  of  the  gypsum  h 
precipitated,  but  it  continues  to  come  out  down  i 
three  percent.  Salt  begins  at  8.5  percent  and  continu 
to   1.6  percent.  Magnesium  salts  do  not  come  dovi 
until  three  percent  of  the  original  volume,  therefon 
they  remain  in  the  bittern,  which  contains  magnesiuii 
potassium,  and  sodium  chloride,  potassium  bromkiii 
and  magnesium  sulfate. 

Throughout  the  world  it  has  been  found  mo 
practical  to  make  the  best  grades  of  salt  from  rex

ilt  and  artificial  brines,  and  solar  salt  manufacture 
is  been  abandoned  except  for  local  use  in  the  less 
idustrialized  regions.  In  San  Francisco  Bay,  however, 
iree  factors  favorable  to  rapid  solar  evaporation  are 
)mbined,  so  that  this  age-old  method  has  been  per- 
:cted  and  modernized.  First,  the  dry  climate,  lack  of 
lin  during  the  summer,  and  summer  winds  cause  high 
^aporation.  Second,  the  thousands  of  acres  of  salt 
larsh  provide  low-lying  land  on  which  the  neces- 
rily  large  acreage  of  evaporating  ponds  may  be  built, 
he  marshes  are  at  or  close  to  sea  level  which  mini- 
izes  pumping,  and  the  clay  soil  provides  natural 
ater-tight  bottoms  which  minimize  leakage.  Finally, 
le  industries  of  the  bay  area  constitute  a  ready 
arket. 
The  Leslie  Salt  Company  now  evaporates  bay  water 

ponds  covering  50,000  acres.  The  ponds  often  look 
d  or  brown  when  seen  from  a  high  vantage  point. 
ly  water  which  contains  between  1.9  and  2.2  percent 
It,  is  admitted  through  tidal  gates  into  the  first  of  a 
ries  of  10  concentrating  ponds.  (Pond  areas  of  400 

500  acres  each  are  required.)  Over  a  period  of  four 

five  years,  the  brine  is  moved  from  pond  to  pond, 
•ine  in  the  last  concentrating  pond  contains  about 
.5  percent  salts. 

After  the  winter  rains,  the  concentrated  brine  is  run 
rough  a  series  of  crystallizing  ponds,  where  con- 
iued  evaporation  causes  salt  to  form  and  fall  to  the 
ttom.  Bittern  is  drawn  from  the  last  pond  and  sent 

the  bittern  storage.  An  attempt  is  made  to  adjust 
e  rate  of  flow  of  the  brine  through  the  crystallizing 
nds,  so  that  the  brine  remains  unsaturated  with  bit- 

n  salts.  Occasionally,  however,  in  order  to  prevent 
i  formation  of  bittern  salts,  it  is  necessary  to  drain 

:   crystallizing   ponds   and   refill   them    with    fresh 

ncentrated  brine.  From  four  to  six  inches  of  salt 

•ms  during  the  evaporation  season. 
Crude  salt  is  harvested  from  September  to  late  De- 
Tiber.   At  the  end   of  the  evaporating  season,  the 

rstallizing  ponds  are  drained  and  the  crude  salt  that 

;  formed  on  the  bottom  is  broken  up  and  loaded 

0  cars  by  machines  mounted  on  caterpillar  treads. 
ie  crude  salt  is  washed  first  with  concentrated  brine 
\\  then  with  fresh  water  before  it  is  stockpiled. 
\luch  salt  is  sold  in  bulk  directly  from  the  stock- 
:.  It  contains  99.50  percent  NaCl.  Semi-refined  salt 
fitaining  99.80  percent  NaCl  is  rewashed,  kiln-dried, 

1  screened.  For  making  refined  salt,  crude  material 
dissolved  in  fresh  water,  treated  chemically,  and 
tporated  in  a  triple-effect  evaporator.  The  crystals 
med  are  dewatered,  dried,  screened,  and  packed, 
cuum-refined  salt  contains  99.9  percent  NaCl. 

•Jo  important  use  of  the  discarded  bittern  was  made 
lil  World  War  I,  although  in  1880  the  Union  Pacific 
■:  Company  was  recovering  magnesium  carbonate 
c  sale  to  the  Hercules  Powder  Company.  It  has  been 
Smated  that  the  bittern  produced  in  making  100,000 
05  of  salt  contains  2,600  tons  of  potassium  chloride, 
1)00  tons  of  magnesium  chloride,  7,500  tons  of  mag- 
it  um  sulfate,  and  240  tons  of  elemental  bromine, 
w  shortage  of  chemicals,  especially  of  potassium 
as  during  World  War  I,  created  a  new  interest  in 
&gt;iern  salts. 


When  chemicals  again  became  plentiful  after  the  end 
of  the  war,  these  plants  operated  at  a  disadvantage. 
The  last  one  was  closed  in  1926  and  the  salt  companies 
have  played  no  further  part  in  the  recovery  of  bittern 
salts. 

The  magnesia  industry  took  the  next  step  when  in 
1923  the  California  Chemical  Corporation,  a  subsidiary 
of  the  National  Kellastone  Company,  built  a  plant  at 
San  Diego  for  the  recovery  of  magnesium  chloride 
used  in  the  manufacture  of  oxychloride  cement.  Bro- 
mine was  recovered  at  this  plant  in  1926,  the  first  time 
bromine  was  recovered  in  California.  Later  the  same 
year,  a  second  bromine  plant  was  built  at  San  Mateo 
and  this  also  treated  bittern.  The  California  Chemical 
Corporation  then  arranged  long-term  contracts  for 
bittern  with  the  salt  companies  and  began  the  con- 
struction of  a  much  larger  plant  at  Newark  to  recover 
bromine  and  magnesium  chloride. 

As  the  market  for  magnesium  chloride  was  limited, 
research  was  initiated  on  the  problem  of  recovering 
other  magnesium  compounds.  A  pilot  plant  was  built 
in  which  lime  made  from  oyster  shells  was  used  to 
precipitate  magnesium  hydroxide  which  could  be  car- 
bonated to  make  basic  magnesium  carbonate  or  cal- 
cined to  make  magnesium  oxide.  Perhaps  the  most 
critical  problem  was  the  formation  of  a  granular  pre- 
cipitate which  could  be  easily  washed  and  filtered, 
but  another  problem  to  be  solved  was  the  preparation 
of  quicklime  from  oyster  shells.  These  problems  were 
eventually  solved  and  a  new  plant  was  completed  late 
in  1937.  In  the  same  year,  the  California  Chemical 
Corporation  passed  into  the  hands  of  the  Westvaco 
Chlorine  Products  Corporation. 

The  first  recovery  in  the  United  States  of  mag- 
nesium compounds  directly  from  sea  water  was  made 
by  Marine  Chemical  Company  in  1927  at  South  San 
Francisco.  Relatively  small  quantities  of  high-priced 
compounds  such  as  milk  of  magnesia,  basic  magne- 
sium carbonate  for  coating  salt,  and  magnesium  oxide 
for  the  pharmaceutical  industry,  were  produced. 

Raw  sea  water,  which  contains  0.01  of  a  pound  of 
magnesium  per  gallon,  must  be  purified  before  treat- 
ment so  that  impurities  in  the  raw  sea  water  will  not 
appear  in  the  final  product.  Purification  is  accom- 
plished by  treating  the  water  with  chlorine  and  lime, 
and  filtering. 

Magnesium  hydroxide  is  precipitated  with  a  slurry 
of  slaked  lime.  The  precipitate  is  a  gummy  slime, 
which  requires  special  and  elaborate  handling  in  order 
to  be  dewatered  and  freed  of  sodium  and  displaced 
with  calcium  salts.  Originally,  the  magnesium  hydrox- 
ide was  precipitated  with  calcined  shells,  but  now 
calcined  dolomite  from  the  Westvaco  quarry,  San 
Benito  County,  is  used.  The  magnesium  hydroxide 
may  be  dried,  carbonated,  or  calcined,  depending  on 
the  product  desired. 

The  Leslie  Salt  Company,  the  largest  producer  in 
the  bay  area,  owns  all  or  the  40,000  acres  of  salt  ponds 
in  San  Mateo,  Santa  Clara,  and  Alameda  Counties.  In 
1961,  Leslie  started  harvesting  from  10,000  acres  of 
salt  ponds  adjacent  to  San  Pablo  Bay  in  Napa  County, 
primarily  in  response  to  increased  demand  for  salt  and 
to  provide  salt  to  its  largest  local  consumer,  the  Dow 
Chemical  Company.

In  any  large  scale  mining  operation,  a  long  range 
plan  of  development  and  exploitation  is  an  essential 
phase  of  mineral  economics.  The  production  of  salt 
requires  long  range  plans  and  as  it  is  such  an  essential 
industry  undoubtedly  will  be  in  existence  for  at  least 
another  100  years,  or  until  such  time  that  mineral 
economics  justify  a  greater  income  from  a  higher 
land  use.  One  such  use,  developing  the  salt  ponds  for 
use  as  real  estate,  is  quite  costly  and  time  consuming 
and  requires  considerable  acreage  to  be  economically 
feasible. 

Former  salt  ponds  owned  by  the  Leslie  Salt  Com- 
pany near  Redwood  City  in  San  Mateo  County,  are 
being  converted  to  a  high  value  real  estate  develop- 
ment, known  as  Redwood  Shores.  Approximately 
4,500  acres  of  former  salt  ponds  will  be  so  developed 
at  a  great  expense  for  conversion  into  buildable  land 
for  a  major  urban  development  housing  as  many  as 
60,000  people  in  the  next  25  years. 

Future  conversion  of  salt  ponds  in  the  bay  to  real 
estate  will  depend  in  a  large  part  on  the  pattern  of 
population  growth  and  resultant  pressures  and  demands 
for  usable  real  estate.  According  to  long  range  projec- 
tions of  the  U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers,  the  great- 
est population  press  will  be  exerted  upon  the  salt 
ponds  in  San  Mateo  County  first,  then  those  in  Santa 
Clara  County,  next  Alameda  County,  and  lastly  Napa 
and  Solano  County.  However,  spokesmen  for  Leslie 
Salt  have  indicated  that  the  Alameda  County  and  Santa 
Clara  County  ponds  are  not  likely  to  be  converted 
in  the  foreseeable  future — the  Alameda  County  ponds 
because  they  are  contiguous  to  the  largest  single  proc- 
essing plant,  which  is  located  at  Newark  (the  most 
valuable  ponds  are  those  nearest  the  plant,  because 
transportation  adds  heavily  to  the  cost  of  salt)  and 
the  Santa  Clara  County  ponds,  because  extensive 
ground  water  withdrawal  has  been  causing  the  gen- 
eral area  to  subside  several  feet,  making  the  depth  of 
fill  required  to  overcome  the  total  potential  subsidence 
probably  uneconomical. 


It  appears  that  salt  recovery  by  solar  evaporatic 
will  continue  as  long  as  the  local  product  is  compet 
tive  in  price  with  salt  imported  into  the  bay  area  ar 
there  is  not,  therefore,  a  more  profitable  use  to  I 
made  of  the  land  now  developed  for  salt  ponds  ar 
related  facilities.  Salt  is  a  low-priced  commodity  ar 
over-land  bulk  shipment  adds  significantly  to  its  cos 
Within  the  last  few  years  salt  produced  in  Mexico  h 
been  sold  competitively  in  the  northwest  Unite 
States  and  in  southern  California,  but  Leslie  spoke 
men  report  that  salt  from  Mexico  is  not  competitiV 
in  the  bay  area  nor  is  there  enough  of  it  to  serve  tn 
bay  area  market.  So  the  preservation  of  salt  ponds  f( 
salt  production  purposes  is  important  to  the  bay  an 
economy;  but  total  cessation  of  production  is  unlike!1 
for  so  many  decades  that  consequences  to  the  loc 
economy  cannot  be  evaluated  and  these  would  appa 
ently  pertain  only  to  the  additional  cost  of  transport;

BAY    MUD    DEVELOPMENTS 
AND    RELATED    STRUCTURAL    FOUNDATIONS 

By  Charles  H.  Lee  and  Michael  Praszker 


SCOPE 

Presented  herewith  are  studies,  analyses  and  discus- 

ons  relating  to  the  potential  problems  of  placing  fills 

pon  soft  bay  mud.  Specifically,  the  report  presents, 

om  an  engineering  viewpoint,  the  problems  related 

fill  stability,  fill  settlement  and  the  response  of  the 

iderlying  bay  mud  to  its  superimposed  loads.  Settle- 

ent  measurements  made  on  existing  fills  have  been 

sembled,  and  future  settlement  and  differential  settle- 

ents  for  various  thicknesses  of  fill  and  depth  of  mud 

ive  been  analyzed  theoretically.  The  effect  of  mud 

splacement   beyond    fill    boundaries    has    also    been 

adied    from    field    observations.    Recommendations 

:aling  with  good  engineering  practice  for  fill  place- 

ent  and  fill  quality  are  presented  together  with  basic 

•ncepts  justifying  such  recommendations. 

Structural  behavior  of  buildings  in  mud-filled  areas, 

d  the  behavior  of  fills  on  compressible  soils  during 

rthquakes  are  being  presented  to  the  Commission 

companion  reports  by  Karl  V.  Steinbrugge,  Struc- 

ral  Engineer,  and  by  Professor  H.  Bolton  Seed,  re- 

lectively.  It  is,  however,  impossible  to  separate  the 

jbject  matter  of  this  report  from  at  least  some  aspects 

these  two  subjects.  Wherever  pertinent,  attention 

11  be  drawn  to  earthquake  problems,  but  no  attempt 

11  be  made  to  theorize  on  them. 


INTRODUCTION 

The  behavior  of  filled-in  lowlands  underlain  by  bay 
ud  has  been  a  matter  of  concern  to  both  laymen 

i  experts  in  the  San  Francisco  bay  area  ever  since 
l/elopment  of  such  lands  commenced.  Bay  fills  date 
&lt;:k  to  the  latter  part  of  the  19th  Century,  the  first 

a  to  have  been  filled  being  the  San  Francisco  water- 
int.  The  extent  of  bay  filling  that  has  taken  place 

ring  the  last  three  decades  has  far  exceeded  that  of 
I  preceding  80  years. 

The  history  of  early  bay  fills  has  been  recorded  by 

ious  agencies.  Some  of  its  marks  in  the  form  of 

ipidated  buildings,  continuously  sinking  streets  and 
ntured  utilities  are  still  extant.  Evidences  of  destruc- 
h  wrought  upon  certain  bay-filled  areas  during  the 


earthquake  of  1906  have  long  been  covered  up,  and 
subsequent  refillings  to  bring  streets  up  to  grade  are 
also  a  matter  of  the  past.  Some  kind  of  stability  seems 
to  have  been  reached  during  the  100  years'  existence 
of  these  fills,  but  in  some  areas  the  present  degree  of 
this  stability  is  a  matter  of  speculation. 

It  should  be  pointed  out  that  the  very  early  fills  were 
placed  haphazardly,  and  it  is  doubtful  whether  any 
attempt  was  made  to  predict  their  future  behavior 
with  respect  to  either  total  and  differential  settlement 
or  even  static  stability,  let  alone  behavior  during  earth- 
quake. 

Although  recent  fills  have  been  placed  with  the  aid 
of  available  technological  skill,  there  still  exist  some 
uncertainties  with  regard  to  the  ultimate  behavior  of 
these  fills  under  static  conditions  or  during  earth- 
quakes. 

All  fills  placed  on  mud  are  subject  to  subsidence 
due  to  the  compressible  nature  of  the  mud,  but  the 
amount  of  subsidence  and  especially  the  pattern  in 
which  it  develops  can  be  predicted  only  under  assumed 
ideal  conditions.  Under  such  conditions  it  is  assumed 
that  the  mud  is  progressively  compressed  downward 
until  stability  is  attained.  The  time  during  which  sub- 
sidence continues  and  the  amount  of  subsidence  is  then 
computed  on  a  theoretical  basis.  Such  consideration 
does  not  account  for  subsidence  due  to  lateral  dis- 
placement of  mud,  nor  could  the  amount  of  such  lat- 
eral displacement  be  predicted  on  a  rational  basis.  Dur- 
ing the  process  of  filling,  particularly  on  the  uncrusted 
bay  mud,  the  intrinsic  characteristics  of  the  mud  are 
likely  to  have  changed,  and  by  the  time  the  fill  is  fully 
placed  the  underlying  mud  has  lost  most  of  its  initial 
strength  and  has  become  an  uncontrollable  jelly-like 
mass  which  may  flow  in  any  direction.  Upward  dis- 
placement of  the  bay  bottom  far  beyond  fill  boundary 
has  been  observed,  and  while  there  is  no  theoretical 
means  by  which  the  degree  of  such  displacement  can 
be  computed,  it  invariably  appears  in  the  form  of  mud 
waves  which  sometimes  extend  more  than  1,000  feet 
into  the  open  bay. 

There  appears  to  be  some  reassurance  in  the  fact 
that  fills   placed   over   encrusted   tidal   marshes   have 


[43]

proved  to  be  more  successful  with  regard  to  lateral 
mud  movement.  There  have  also  been  cases  of  judi- 
cious methods  of  fill  placement  whereby  resulting  mud 
wave  action  has  been  minimized.  However,  future  be- 
havior of  even  these  fills,  both  with  regard  to  effects 
beyond  fill  boundaries  and  during  earthquake,  remain 
to  be  ascertained  and  cannot  be  predicted  with  cer- 
tainty at  this  time. 

The  casual  observer  looking  north  during  low  tide 
at  the  east  bay  toll  plaza  of  the  San  Francisco-Oakland 
Bay  Bridge,  can  actually  see  the  mud  heave  which 
took  place  far  beyond  the  fill  boundary.  Similar  obser- 
vations can  be  made  from  the  Candlestick  causeway 
and  at  Candlestick  Park  parking  lot.  Some  of  these 
heaves  were  intentionally  created;  nonetheless,  the  lat- 
eral movements  of  mud  underlying  extensive  fill  may 
encroach  upon  navigation  channels  as  well  as  the  open 
bay. 

To  a  large  extent,  it  is  the  lateral  mud  flow  from 
under  fills  which  accounts  for  observed  settlements 
that  by  far  exceed  the  theoretically  predicted  settle- 
ments, as  is  the  case  in  some  fills  described  in  this 
report. 

Problems  have  developed  to  various  degrees  relating 
to  structures  supported  either  directly  by  fill  over- 
lying mud,  or  by  deep  foundations.  The  problems 
range  from  tilted  buildings,  cracking  of  walls,  and 
vertical  separation  of  buildings,  to  the  sinking  of  sur- 
rounding ground  in  the  case  of  piled  foundation. 

Where  buildings  are  constructed  on  fills  newly 
placed  on  mud,  due  consideration  must  be  given  to 
types  of  foundations  in  relation  to  the  future  utility  of 
the  buildings.  If  foundations  take  support  in  the  fill 
overlying  the  mud,  then  the  foundations  will  settle 
as  the  fill  settles,  even  if  the  effect  of  foundation  loads 
is  neglected.  Since  uniform  fill  settlement  cannot  be 
anticipated,  differential  settlements  in  the  building  are 
inevitable.  For  buildings  occupying  an  extensive  area 
on  fill  10  to  15  feet  in  thickness  overlying  50  to  60 
feet  of  mud,  such  differential  settlements  may  be  in 
the  range  of  six  inches  to  a  foot.  Some  warehouses 
in  the  bay  area  constructed  over  bay  mud  have  under- 
gone settlements  in  this  range. 

When  dealing  with  high-rise  buildings  supported  on 
deep  piles,  or  any  other  heavy  structures  supported  on 
piles,  the  problem,  apart  from  the  stability  of  such 
foundations  during  earthquakes,  still  remains  with  re- 
gard to  the  surrounding  ground  which  carries  utility 
pipes  such  as  sewer,  water  and  gas.  One  case  history 
will  show  surrounding  ground  settling  away  from 
building  to  an  extent  that  ramps  are  used  for  entrance 
to  the  buildings. 

This  report  presents  recommendations  for  practical 
support  of  buildings  on  fill  with  a  view  to  minimizing 
differential  settlements  by  allowing  the  fill  to  undergo 
its  most  critical  subsidence  prior  to  construction  of  the 
buildings.  It  also  deals  with  the  practical  aspects  of 
deep  foundations  with  emphasis  on  future  behavior 
and  avoidance  of  deterioration. 

The  purpose  of  this  report  will  be  served  if  it  brings 
about  a  clear  understanding  of  what  is  entailed  by 
filling  soft  land,  and  to  what  degree  such  operations 
may  be  successful,  at  best,  and  at  worst,  what  failures 
may  result  by  injudicious  operations. 


THE  NATURE  AND  CHARACTERISTICS 
OF  SOFT  BAY  MUD 

The  soft  bay  mud  beneath  low  lying  lands  on  tl 
periphery  of  San  Francisco  Bay  is  generally  of  mari» 
origin.  The  history  of  its  deposition  is  immateri 
within  the  scope  of  this  report,  but  its  composition 
important  for  the  purpose  of  predicting  its  behavii 
under  superimposed  loads. 

The  soft  bay  mud  consist  of  fine-grained  particl 
ranging  from  clay  size  (less  than  2  microns  in  diar 
eter)  to  silt  and  very  fine  sand  (less  than  100  microi 
in  diameter).  These  soils  have  been  deposited  by  sec1 
mentation  in  still  waters  and  have  accumulated  durir 
the  past  as  the  sea  level  progressively  rose  toward  tl 
end  of  the  last  glacial  period.  Included  in  the  depo; 
tion  of  this  silty  clay  are  various  organic  substanc 
such  as  shells,  vegetable  matter  and  peat.  Also  includ( 
are  lenses  and  stringers  of  fresh  water  deposits  such 
sand  and  gravel,  and  occasionally  there  are  sand  ba 
overlying  the  mud. 

Since  the  progressive  buildup  of  the  organic  clayt 
silt,  generally  referred  to  as  "bay  mud,"  took  pla' 
over  a  long  period  of  time,  it  has  buried  the  previous 
existing  ground  surface  with  its  open  valley  and  ravin 
extending  back  into  the  hills.  The  rise  of  the  oce: 
level  caused  inundation  of  the  valley  and  high 
ground  with  resulting  deposition  of  bay  mud  and  tl 
filling  up  of  ravines.  The  configuration  of  the  b; 
bottom  and  its  existing  shores  is  therefore  highly  i 
regular  and  the  thickness  of  superimposed  mud  vari 
greatly. 

The  bay  mud  that  is  exposed  at  low  tide  and  al 
that  which  is  submerged  in  the  bay,  is  in  an  unconso 
dated,  semi-fluid  state;  that  is  to  say,  it  has  not  unde 
gone  consolidation  to  the  extent  that  have  the  old 
bay  muds  underlying  the  bay  at  greater  depths.  Pare 
thetically,  the  older  and  lower  bay  muds  are  separati 
from  the  upper,  unconsolidated  bay  muds  by  a  thic 
layer  of  alluvial  deposits  and  will  not  be  considen 
in  this  report. 

The  upper  layer  of  bay  mud  lying  above  mean  tii 
and  especially  above  high  tide,  is  largely  derived  fra 
fine  sediment  deposited  from  local  drainage  water 
Its  pore  water  is  brackish.  It  supports  marsh  veget 
tion  which  forms  a  mat  of  roots  and  fiber  often  a 
cumulating  as  peat.  During  the  summer  periods  it  dri 
out  by  evaporation  and  tends  to  consolidate;  a  mer 
brane  or  crust  of  2  to  3  feet  thickness  has  thus  be&lt; 
formed  and  covers  the  soft  mud.  Tidal  lands  original 
exposed  at  low  water  when  levied  off  and  used  f&lt;| 
agriculture  tend  to  form  a  similar  crust  after  years  i 
use.  Such  a  crust  acquires  tenacity  and,  if  unbroke 
will  support  light  grading  equipment.  It  can  be  qui 
useful  in  grading  operations  if  preserved  in  its  u: 
broken  condition. 

Dry  unit  weights  of  the  upper  bay  mud  typical 
vary  from  as  low  as  40  pounds  per  cubic  foot  to  &lt; 
pounds  per  cubic  foot.  The  voids  in  the  bay  mu 
which  are  the  spaces  intervening  between  solid  pa 
tides,  are  roughly  twice  the  volume  of  the  sol 
particles.  Thus,  a  cubic  foot  of  bay  mud  is  made  x 
of  one-third  of  a  cubic  foot  of  solid  particles  and  tw

lirds  of  a  cubic  foot  of  intervening  space  which  is 
ccupied  by  water  or  air. 

Due  to  the  fine  texture  of  its  grains  and  the  jelly- 
ke  matrix,  bay  mud  is  known  to  be  highly  imper- 
leable.  Impermeability  can  be  illustrated  by  the  diffi- 
ulty  with  which  water  can  be  squeezed  out  from  the 
oids,  with  accompanying  decrease  in  volume.  It  is 
ommon  knowledge  that  clays,  once  saturated,  can 
nly  be  dried  over  a  long  period  of  time  by  squeezing 
ut  the  water;  contrasted  to  which  is  the  behavior  of 
ranular  sand  which  will  readily  give  up  its  water. 
t  is  this  phenomenon  of  relatively  high  impermeability 
f  the  bay  mud  that  gives  to  it  its  low  strength  and  its 
icapacity  to  support  appreciable  loads. 

In  its  pristine  condition  bay  mud  has  reached  a  state 
f  "continuing  equilibrium,"  by  which  is  meant  that 
le  natural  process  of  consolidation  under  its  own 
/eight  is  approaching  an  asymptotic  limit.  The  term 
onsolidation  simply  implies  a  decrease  in  volume  of  a 
lil  body  by  virtue  of  reduction  of  its  voids  which 
re  filled  with  water  and/or  air.  In  order  to  decrease 
le  volume  of  the  voids,  it  is  necessary  to  force  the 
/ater  and/or  air  out  of  them.  Doing  this  is  equivalent 
d  filling  a  rubber  balloon  with  water,  puncturing  tiny 
oles  in  the  balloon  and  letting  the  water  escape.  If 
ne  holes  are  very  small,  it  will  take  a  long  time  for 
ne  water  to  escape  by  its  own  action.  An  applied 
Kternal  pressure  will  help  the  process  and  accelerate 

The  voids  in  bay  mud  can  be  visualized  as  a  large 
umber  of  water-filled  tiny  balloons,  with  infinitesimal 
oles  through  which  the  water  can  escape.  Even  when 

lens  of  fibrous  peat  or  clean  sand  is  embedded  in  a 
:&gt;dy  of  mud,  the  water  which  occupies  the  lens  can- 
3t  freely  escape  but  must  percolate  through  the  sur- 
)unding  mud.  Such  a  water-filled  lens  may  be  viewed 

a  single  large  balloon,  similar  to  the  ones  described 
i&gt;ove. 

THE  MECHANICS  AND   BEHAVIOR  OF   BAY  MUD 
UNDER  SUPERIMPOSED  LOADS 

When  a  load  such  as  fill  is  placed  upon  mud,  the 
ater  in  the  tiny  voids  is  subjected  to  a  corresponding 
crease  in  pressure  and  the  water  is  squeezed  out  at  a 
jher  rate  than  under  natural  conditions,  just  like 
ueezing  a  water-filled  balloon  punctured  with  tiny 
les.  If  the  pressure  is  not  applied  too  rapidly  and 
not  too  great,  a  certain  amount  of  water  will  squeeze 
t  in  a  certain  interval  of  time  and  the  volume  of  the 
loon  will  correspondingly  decrease.  If  the  pressure 
great  and  is  applied  rapidly,  the  balloon  will  rupture 
cause  the  water  cannot  escape  fast  enough  and  the 
tire  pressure  is  directly  transmitted  to  the  water  and 
:nce  to  the  balloon.  In  this  case  the  tiny  holes  in 
balloon  might  just  as  well  not  be  there,  since  prac- 
ally  no  water  will  escape  in  the  short  interval  of 
assure  application. 

t  can  be  easily  visualized  that  upon  the  application 
a  superimposed  load  on  mud,  the  entire  load  is 
n&gt;mentarily  transferred  to  and  carried  by  the  en- 
Cpped  water.  If  the  load  is  not  too  great  and  the 
a  plication  is  slow,  the  water  will  manage  to  escape 
dough  the  tiny  pores  and  the  solid  grains  will  be 
freed  to  come  closer  together  until  they  are  in   a 


position  to  carry  some  or  all  of  the  superimposed  load. 
But  if  the  load  is  great  and  it  is  applied  suddenly,  the 
high  pore  water  pressures  set  up  in  the  voids  inhibit 
the  soil  from  developing  the  shear  strength  required 
to  prevent  failure. 

The  above  analogy  is  offered  to  explain  in  simple 
terms  what  has  been  known  to  the  profession  for  a 
long  time,  namely  The  Load-Carrying  Capacity  of 
Bay  Mud  Depends  Upon  the  Rate  of  Loading.  The 
appended  case  histories  of  experience  with  bay  fills 
clearly  point  to  the  cause  of  failures  due  to  too  rapid 
loading.  In  common  terms,  the  mud  upon  loading 
Bulges  or  Produces  Mud  Waves  while  the  filled  areas 
Sink.  The  mud  is  said  to  be  in  a  state  of  plastic  flow. 

EXPECTED  TOTAL  AND  DIFFERENTIAL  SETTLEMENTS 
OF  FILL  PLACED  ON  MUD 

The  rational  approach  to  determining  the  future 
settlement  of  fills  on  bay  mud  does  not  include  the 
consideration  of: 

(a)  Settlement  within  the  fill  body  itself. 

(b)  Plastic  flow  of  the  supporting  mud  under  load. 

(c)  Lateral  movement  of  the  mud  resting  upon  an 
inclined  plane  of  rock  or  firm  soil. 

It  is  assumed  that  settlements,  as  computed  by  avail- 
able technological  means,  merely  represent  an  orderly 
theoretical  expulsion  of  pore  water  from  the  mud  body 
under  the  action  of  the  imposed  fill  loads.  If  these 
conditions  are  not  met  in  the  field,  i.e.,  if  any  of  the 
above  conditions  (a),  (b),  or  (c)  occur,  then  the 
theoretical  computations  are  either  appreciably  viti- 
ated or  totally  voided. 

The  amount  of  settlement  to  be  expected  under 
ideal  conditions  in  fills  newly  placed  on  bay  mud  is  a 
function  of: 

1.  The  compressibility  of  the  mud,  Cc. 

2.  Depth  of  mud,  d. 

3.  Density  of  fill,  y 

4.  Height  of  fill,  Ah 

This  function  may  then  be  expressed  in  a  simpli- 
fied manner: 

S  =  K  (Ah)  (Y)  (d) 

where  "S"  is  total  settlement,  and  "K"  is  a  dimension- 
less  constant  depending  upon  various  properties  of  the 
mud  itself,  including  "C." 

It  is  not  necessary  to  understand  the  mathematical 
relation  stated  above,  other  than  to  realize  that  the 
total  settlement,  under  ideal  conditions,  will  depend 
upon  all  these  parameters.  If  then  a  blanket  of  fill  of 
uniform  thickness  is  placed  over  mud,  the  settlement 
will  be  uniform  if  the  thickness  of  the  mud  is  uni- 
form; all  other  factors  being  equal.  If  the  mud  thick- 
ness is  not  uniform,  then  differential  settlement  will 
result  from  this  cause  alone.  Also,  if  the  fill  thickness 
varies,  then  additional  differential  settlement  will  result 
due  to  this  cause. 

It  can  now  be  appreciated  that  only  under  ideal 
conditions  can  uniform  settlement  be  obtained  when 
large  mud  flat  areas  are  developed  by  placement  of 
fills,  since  the  mud  composition  as  well  as  the  mud

[SR  9 


bottom  varies  considerably  due  to  many  geological 
factors.  Frequently  the  mud  rests  upon  a  sloping 
surface,  particularly  when  located  close  to  the  existing 
bay  shore.  This  can  be  explained  in  terms  of  the  geo- 
logical formations  underlying  the  bay.  Consequently, 
when  fill  is  placed  on  offshore  mud  flats  the  following 
conditions  must  be  taken  into  consideration: 

1.  Variation  in  mud  thickness  within  the  fill  area. 

2.  Degree  of  slope  of  the  mud  bottom. 

3.  The  amount  of  plastic  flow  that  may  develop 
during  filling. 

If  any  of  these  three  conditions  are  found  to  obtain 
in  the  field,  deleterious  results  may  be  prevented  only 
by  special  engineering  features  to  be  included  in  the 
design.  Suggested  provisions  to  be  included  in  site 
development  to  overcome  such  conditions  involve 
methods  and  rates  of  filling,  preceded  by  thorough 
soil  explorations. 

As  a  guide  for  expected  settlements  under  ideal  con- 
ditions, figures  1  and  2  are  presented.  Figure  1  shows 
the  relation  between  expected  settlement  for  various 
fill  and  mud  thicknesses.  Figure  2  shows  percent  of 
settlement  (consolidation)  versus  time  in  years,  with 
mud  thicknesses  as  parameters.  Figure  1  assumes  moist 
unit  weight  of  1 10  pounds  per  cubic  foot.  Water  table 
elevation  of  0.0  mean  sea  level  and  top  of  fill  elevation 
of  11  feet  above  Mean  Sea  Level  are  also  assumed. 
Both  assumptions  are  reasonable  for  the  case  of  sand 


fills  oyer  submerged  bay  mud.  The  charts  are  repre 
sentative  of  the  well  established  characteristics  of  th 
upper  bay  mud  in  this  region. 

To  illustrate  the  use  of  the  charts,  suppose  it  is  r( 
quired  to  read  the  ultimate  settlement  produced  b 
10  feet  of  fill  underlain  by  40  feet  of  bay  mud.  Figur 
1  will  show  the  ultimate  settlement  as  being  4  fee 
Figure  2  indicates  that  48  percent  of  this  ultimat 
settlement  will  take  place  in  the  first  five  years,  i.e 
1.92  feet.  Sixty  percent  of  this  settlement  will  be  con 
pleted  at  the  end  of  10  years,  that  is,  2.4  feet;  th 
remaining  40  percent,  or  1.6  feet  of  settlement,  wi 
take  place  in  90  years  thereafter. 

These  theoretical  considerations,  together  with  sei 
tlement  measurements  in  the  field  over  a  number  c 
years,  lead  to  the  conclusion  that  for  fills  over  muc 
less  than  40  feet  in  thickness,  the  most  severe  settlemer 
takes  place  within  the  first  five  years  after  fill  place 
ment.  Although  actual  settlement  continues  beyon 
this  time,  the  rate  at  which  the  mud  consolidates  : 
much  reduced. 

For  mud  thicknesses  in  excess  of  40  feet,  periods  i 
excess  of  five  years  will  be  required  for  the  most  crit: 
cal  settlement  to  take  place.  Figure  2  shows  that  fc 
mud  thickness  of  60  feet,  only  35  percent  of  the  ult: 
mate  settlement  will  take  place  in  the  first  10  year 
Consequently,  when  major  fills  are  placed  over  dee 
mud,  much  research  is  needed  to  determine  fill  settk

ility  of  the  use  of  various  devices  to  accelerate  settle- 
ments before  construction  is  commenced. 
As  a  practical  means  of  establishing  the  pattern  of 
;ttlement  in  any  area  of  fill  on  bay  mud,  it  is  recom- 
mended that  a  number  of  settlement  markers  be  estab- 
shed  in  such  a  manner  as  to  embed  the  markers  in 
He  mud   before   filling  commences,   the   top   of  the 
oarkers  to  be  placed  above  the   final   fill   elevation, 
levations  of  the  top  of  these  markers  must  be  estab- 
shed  prior  to  filling,  during  filling,  and  at  regular 
itervals   after   the   fill   is   placed.    When    settlement 
srsus  time  has  been  observed,  a  curve  can  then  be 
rawn  indicating  the  settlement  trend  with  respect  to 
me.  The  observed  settlement  will  also  give  a  reliable 
idication  or  verification  of  the  variation  in  mud  thick- 
bss.  If  total  settlements  at  various  points  after  a  num- 
:r  of  years  are  then  plotted  in  plan,  a  settlement 
fjntour  map  will  be  established.  The  configuration  and 
iape  of  the  settlement  contours  under  ideal  conditions

otained  will  enable  the  developer  to  adjust  for  differ- 
Mtial  settlements  wherever  they  occur,  and  may  also 
'"■ad  to  further  investigation  of  very  irregular  settle- 
:ent  behavior. 

'  A  process  called  "surcharging"  is  sometimes  used  to 
duce  the  amount  of  settlement  which  the  completed 
A  will  experience.  A  larger  amount  of  fill  is  placed 
ian  is  ultimatelv  intended  on  the  site.  After  enough 


time  has  passed  for  the  water  to  be  squeezed  out  of 
the  mud,  the  excess  fill  is  removed.  The  removal  of  the 
surcharge  will  leave  the  mud  in  a  preconsolidated  con- 
dition and  further  consolidation  thereafter  will  be 
largely  reduced  if  not  entirely  eliminated,  depending 
upon  the  duration  of  the  surcharge  and  other  factors. 

METHODS  AND  CONTROL  FOR  PLACING  FILL 
ON  BAY  MUD 

From  the  previous  description  of  the  composition 
of  the  top  layers  of  bay  mud,  it  should  be  evident  that 
we  are  dealing  with  a  semi-viscous  material  similar  to 
jelly  which  can  easily  change  its  geometrical  con- 
figuration. In  fact,  the  loading  capacity  of  bay  mud 
is  not  measured  so  much  by  the  load  it  can  support 
as  by  the  deformation  that  such  a  load  may  cause. 
When  a  load  upon  bay  mud  is  confined  to  a  small 
area,  the  load  will  make  an  imprint  in  the  form  of 
a  permanent  set,  provided  the  load  is  not  large  enough 
to  cause  the  mud  to  push  out  laterally  and,  conse- 
quently, bulge  at  the  periphery  of  the  loaded  area. 
The  problem,  then,  when  loading  bay  mud  is  mostly 
the  prevention  of  lateral  flow  of  the  mud  under  the 
load.  If  hypothetically  it  were  possible  to  confine  the 
loaded  area  laterally  to  an  appreciable  depth,  then 
the  only  effect  of  loading  mud  would  be  vertical  de- 
flection. The  load-carrying  capacity  of  the  mud  under 
these  conditions  would  be  practically  infinite,  but  in

practice  such  lateral  confinement,  although  possible 
from  an  engineering  standpoint,  may  be  unfeasible 
economically.  Consequently,  when  footing  loads  are 
applied  directly  to  the  mud,  the  allowable  bearing 
capacity  must  be  kept  low,  say  300  pounds  per  square 
foot,  thus  holding  deformation  to  a  minimum.  Some 
lateral  deformation  however  is  practically  inevitable. 
Depositing  fill  on  bay  mud  constitutes  the  application 
of  an  external  force  or  load  upon  the  mud.  If  a  certain 
blanket  of  fill  could  be  placed  on  top  of  the  mud  in 
such  a  manner  as  to  spread  the  load  uniformly  over 
the  whole  area  at  one  time,  then  this  would  be  equiva- 
lent to  placing  a  large  footing  upon  the  mud.  But  this 
procedure  is  not  practical.  In  actual  fact,  fill  material 
is  placed  by  end-dumping  upon  a  certain  limited  area 
and  then  spreading  stage  by  stage,  so  that  while  a  cer- 
tain area  has  been  loaded,  the  neighboring  area  at  the 
edge  of  the  fill  is  free  to  react  plastically  due  to  the 
adjacent  load.  The  observed  effect  of  such  a  procedure 
is  the  creation  of  mud  waves  in  front  of  the  loaded 
area. 

From  a  mud  wave  point  of  view,  the  ideal  method 
of  placing  fill  on  bay  mud  is  by  means  of  hydraulic 
dredge  whereby  the  dredger  fluid  flows  over  large 
areas  and  the  building  up  of  the  sediment  progresses 
more  or  less  uniformly  and  slowly.  This,  if  done  judi- 
ciously, prevents  the  occurrence  of  mud  waves. 

The  continuous  maintenance  of  flat  slopes  at  the 
edge  of  fill  will  greatly  reduce  the  size  and  creation 
of  mudwaves,  provided,  however,  the  fill  is  not  placed 
too  rapidly  and  its  final  height  is  limited.  Slopes  of 
10:1  (10  horizontal  to  1  vertical)  are  known  to  be 
satisfactory,  and  it  is  important  that  such  slopes  be 
maintained  during  the  process  of  filling,  which  is  diffi- 
cult to  achieve  unless  the  fill  is  placed  hydraulically 
and  the  rate  of  filling  does  not  exceed  three  feet  per 
year. 

There  have  been  many  instances  in  the  bay  area 
and  elsewhere  where  attempts  have  been  made  to 
deposit  layers  of  large  stone  upon  cut  mud  slopes  to 
provide  erosion  control.  What  may  have  been  in  the 
minds  of  the  engineers  who  attempted  such  injudicious 
filling  of  the  mud  is  not  known,  but  in  view  of  the 
foregoing  description  of  the  makeup  and  behavior 
of  bay  mud,  it  is  beyond  the  realm  of  wishful  thinking 
that  such  fills  could  be  permanently  stable.  Records 
show  that  these  rock  fills  disappeared  suddenly  into 
the  mud  and  only  a  mud  wave  was  left  to  indicate 
the  burial  ground  of  the  rock. 

In  other  cases,  fills  have  been  placed  to  appreciable 
heights  with  no  regard  to  the  significance  of  mud 
waves  that  were  produced  during  the  filling  operations. 
As  a  consequence,  a  longitudinal  section  through  the 
filled  area  after  fills  had  been  placed  showed  the  con- 
tact plane  between  the  mud  and  the  fill  to  be  a  con- 
tinuous warped  surface.  While  the  designed  thickness 
of  fill  was  to  have  been  uniform,  say  20  feet,  the  actual 
conditions  of  the  fill  show  variation  of  fill  thickness 
from  a  minimum  of,  say  10  feet,  to  a  maximum  of, 
say  30  feet.  Under  these  conditions  of  filling  and  final 
placement,  there  is  no  method  of  computing,  or  even 
of  guessing,  as  to  what  the  final  settlement  pattern 
might  be. 


It  is  therefore  concluded  that  for  a  satisfactoi 
placement  of  fills  on  mud  for  which  settlement  con 
putations  have  been  made  under  ideal  conditions,  tl 
following  requirements  should  be  met  in  the  field: 

(a)  At  no  time  should  a  mud. wave  be  allowed 
develop  during  filling  operations.  (This  may  necess 
tate  in  some  cases  a  filling  rate  as  low  as  three  fe| 
per  year.) 

(b)  Boundary  conditions  should  be  strictly  coi 
trolled  to  prevent  progressive  outward  lateral  flow 
the  mud. 

Practical  means  of  accomplishing  these  requiremen 
might  be  the  placing  of  the  first  blanket  as  hydrauli 
fill  of  a  minimum  thickness  of  three  feet  before  com 
paction  equipment  is  put  in  use. 

CRITICAL  BOUNDARIES  OF  INSTABILITY 
UNDER  STATIC  CONDITIONS 

The  balancing  of  a  fill  blanket  on  soft  bay  mud 
by  no  means  to  be  viewed  as  being  statically  stabl 
Even  if  the  blanket  has  been  uniformly  placed,  ar 
mud  waves  have  been  prevented  during  placing,  tl 
stability  of  the  boundaries  still  has  many  indetermina 
aspects.  A  large  fill  blanket  normally  constitutes  s 
area  of  infinite  dimensions,  so  that  each  element 
area  in  the  center  of  the  blanket  is  protected  by  coi 
fining  pressures  from  its  neighboring  elements.  Wh&lt; 
approaching  the  boundary  of  the  fill  blanket,  cone 
tions  change  rapidly.  At  the  very  edge  of  the  f 
blanket  the  mud  is  free  to  move  outward  and  upwar 
The  upward  movement  due  to  plastic  flow  may  l; 
prevented  by  a  gently  sloping  embankment,  as  mei: 
tioned  earlier,  but  only  to  the  extent  of  the  confinir' 
downward  pressures  that  the  embankment  affords.  Tl 
actual  upward  pressures  at  the  periphery  of  a  f 
blanket  do  not  lend  themselves,  at  the  present  sta 
of  technology,  to  mathematical  analysis.  From  obse 
vations  it  has  been  established  that  some  heaving  b 
yond  the  fill  periphery  is  inevitable;  it  is  more  pr&lt;' 
nounced  in  the  case  of  fills  with  steep  slopes  than  wit 
gentle  slopes.  It  is  also  more  pronounced  when  fil 
have  been  placed  by  end-dumping  rather  than  b 
hydraulic  dredging. 

One  further  element  of  boundary  condition  tbij 
usually  causes  instability  is  tidal  fluctuation.  At  a  ce 
tain  stage  of  high  tide  the  slope  of  the  bay  fill 
partially  confined  by  the  tidal  water.  At  other  stag, 
during  low  tide  this  confinement  is  removed.  The  f, 
slope  and  its  underlying  mud  is  therefore  subjects 
to  a  continuous  process  of  stress  change,  and  the  ur] 
derlying  mud  may  fail  without  any  other  extern: 
provocation. 

When  fill  has  been  placed  on  mud  which  rests  upol 
an  inclined  plane,  there  is  a  constant  tendency  for  thl 
loaded  fill  to  creep  downward.  After  the  lapse  of  somi 
time,  two  typical  boundary  conditions  may  preser 
themselves;  the  boundary  closest  to  the  shore  ma, 
show  cracking  of  the  fill  whereas  the  offshore  bound 
ary  will  show  heaving  of  the  mud  beyond  the  fil 
The  mud  therefore  is  undergoing  slow  lateral  di:i 
placement  along  the  inclined  plane  and  carries  th| 
fill  with  it.

The  term  "boundary  condition,"  as  used  in  this 
ontext,  also  applies  to  any  abrupt  irregularities  in  the 
md  surface  such  as  would  be  created  by  injudicious 
lethods  of  filling.  If,  for  instance,  the  fill  has  been 
laced  in  such  a  way  as  to  remold  the  mud  surface 
)  form  crests,  which  are  close  to  the  fill  surface, 
id  adjacent  valleys,  which  have  depressed  the  mud 
lastically,  then  each  crest  and  valley  constitutes  a 
&gt;cal  boundary  condition.  The  plastic  deformation  of 
\e  mud  in  this  fashion  reduces  the  normal  strength 
haracteristics  of  the  mud  and  constitutes  a  potential 
reak  zone.  Although  the  fill  overlying  this  irregular 
md  surface  may  balance  itself  under  normal  con- 
itions,  it  is  likely  to  be  the  first  area  to  rupture  under 
iverse  conditions. 

In  some  instances,  particularly  when  deep  water  is 
quired  just  outboard  of  the  fill,  dikes  or  sheet  pile 
jt-off  walls  are  used  as  a  fill  boundary.  The  Army 
:reet  Terminal  in  San  Francisco  and  the  new  7th 
reet  Terminal  in  Oakland  are  examples  of  this  kind 

construction. 

All  the  above  mentioned  conditions  become  more 
itical  in  the  case  of  earthquakes,  which  are  not  con- 
dered  in  this  report. 

The  stabilization  of  boundary  conditions  is  there- 
ire  deemed  essential  to  achieve  nominal  stability.  The 
e  of  deep  sand  trenches  has  been  mentioned  but 
her  stabilization  methods  such  as  effective  surcharge, 
ainage  by  filters,  etc.,  are  presently  undergoing  test- 
g.  iMuch  research  is  needed  to  establish  a  practical 
d  economic  method  to  provide  boundary  stabilities 
l  bay  fills. 

It  should  be  noted  that  the  above  discussion  of 
mndary  instability  of  fills  placed  upon  mud  applies 
imarily  to  deep  mud  deposits  or  to  mud  resting  upon 
clined  firm  downward  sloping  surfaces.  Where  the 
ud  is  shallow  or  rests  upon  firm  upward  sloping 
rfaces  at  moderate  depth,  stability  conditions  are 
odified  and  plastic  flow  with  heaving  may  not  be  a 
rious  problem.  The  critical   depth   of  mud  which 

ntrols  boundary  conditions  with  respect  to  lateral 
astic  flow  is  not  known  and  should  be  the  subject 

research. 

TYPES  OF  FILL  THAT  CAN  BE  USED 
FOR  FILLING  SOFT  LAND 

The  term  "fill"  or  "fill  material"  generally  relates 

solid,  particulate  material  that  can  be  deposited  upon 

m  or  semi-liquid  ground  with  resulting  rise  of  the 

efilled  ground  surface  elevation.  Requirements  such 

nonperishable,  noncompressible,  granular  or  well- 

aded  materials  have  to  do  with  fill  quality  that  is 

rquired  for  any  specific  purpose.  It  therefore  follows 

pt  almost  any  material  which  is  capable  of  raising 

te  ground  surface  of  an  area  upon  which  it  is  de- 

fsited  is  fill  material. 

Fill  materials  that  may  be  used  for  filling  soft  land 
Seh  as  bay  mud  include  almost  all  fill  types,  except, 
prhaps,  coarse  rock  or  boulders  which  have  the  tend- 
ency to  sink  into  the  mud  without  appreciably  raising 
te  surface  area,  or,  more  often,  the  area  outside  the 
r:k  fill  is  raised  by  mud  wave  action,  while  the  rock 
s  ks  into  the  mud.  The  use  of  rock  fill  materials  is 


therefore  limited.  It  may,  however,  be  used  to  displace 
shallow  mud  layers  by  allowing  it  to  sink  to  firm 
ground.  The  types  of  fill  which  are  commonly  avail- 
able adjacent  to  mud  flats,  and  which  can  be  utilized 
for  various  purposes,  as  explained  later,  are  as  follows: 

1.  Dredged  mud 

2.  Dredged  sand 

3.  Garbage  mixed  with  sand 

4.  Imported  and  compacted  fill  from  excavations 

5.  A  combination  of  1  through  4 

PURPOSES  FOR  WHICH  VARIOUS  TYPES 
OF  FILL  CAN  BE  UTILIZED 

Generally  speaking,  there  is  some  use  for  practically 
all  types  of  fill,  be  it  for  filling  in  a  cavity  in  the 
ground  or  for  raising  ground  level  of  large  areas.  The 
following  enumeration  of  the  various  purposes  for 
which  fills  can  be  used  is  applicable  to  mud  flats,  sub- 
merged land,  or  generally,  soft  low  lands: 

(1)  Recreation 

(2)  Industry  and  commerce 

(3)  Residence 

Recreation 

Development  of  recreational  areas  by  filling  is 
treated  first,  largely  because  this  kind  of  development 
is  less  sensitive  to  poor  selection  of  fill  materials.  Ap- 
preciable future  settlement  in  areas  of  parks,  tennis 
courts,  and  sundry  light  structures  with  light  access 
roads  can  be  easily  accommodated  by  providing  ini- 
tially for  higher  ground  levels.  Differential  settlements 
would  have  little  bearing  on  such  development,  except 
perhaps  in  the  immediate  area  of  light  structures,  which 
can  receive  special  local  treatment.  It  is  noted  that 
the  lighter  the  fill  material,  the  less  consolidation  will 
occur  in  the  underlying  mud.  Since  no  concentrated 
loads  are  to  be  imposed  on  such  areas,  the  fill  type 
most  suitable,  least  costly,  and  abundantly  available  is 
garbage  with  some  admixture  of  wind  blown  or 
dredged  sand.  The  admixture  of  sand  is  necessary  to 
fill  the  large  voids  in  the  garbage  material,  which 
otherwise  would  compress  and  decompose  internally. 
A  mixture  of  60  percent  garbage  with  40  percent 
dredged  or  windblown  sand  would  constitute  a  suit- 
able fill  material  for  recreational  areas. 

This  does  not  preclude  the  use  of  superior  fill  types 
such  as  dredged  mud,  dredged  sand  and/or  imported 
fills,  but  as  a  matter  of  economy  the  inferior  fills  will 
suffice.  Where  the  area  to  be  filled  for  this  purpose 
is  submerged,  it  may  be  advisable  to  raise  it  above 
mean  sea  level  by  dredged  mud  and  continue  with 
garbage  and  sand  fill. 

Industry  and  Commerce 

Fills  placed  in  areas  to  be  used  for  industrial  and 
commercial  purposes  have  to  be  selected  and  fairly 
incompressible.  By  select  fill  is  meant  fill  which  is  well- 
graded  with  the  absence  of  large  voids  which  might 
permit  the  mud  to  squeeze  upward  into  the  fill  body. 
This  requirement  is  mandatory  not  only  because  of 
the  building  loads  that  may  be  imposed  upon  the  fill, 
but  because  of  roads  and  utilities.  Incompressibility 
of  the  fill  material,  however,  will  not  prevent  consoh- 


so

dation  in  the  underlying  mud  with  resulting  future 
settlement  which  may  be  large,  depending  upon  the 
amount  of  fill  placed  and  the  time  elapsing  between 
completion  of  fill  and  final  development. 

The  final  ground  surface  elevation  to  which  indus- 
trial and  commercial  fills  should  be  raised  is  controlled 
by  the  following  factors: 

(1)  Drainage  or  flood  control  including  tidal  wave 

(2)  Required  thickness  of  fill  for  footing  loads 

(3)  Earthquake   considerations    (not  being  treated 
in  this  report) 

The  method  of  placing  fills  for  this  purpose  must 
be  carefully  executed  as  explained  earlier  in  this  report. 
In  the  case  of  submerged  land,  it  is  necessary  to  bring 
the  surface  up  to  or  slightly  above  mean  sea  level  by 
slow  process  such  as  dredging.  A  cut-off  trench  filled 
with  sand  may  have  to  be  employed  to  prevent  mud 
heave  beyond  the  fill  boundary.  Tamping  of  fill  ma- 
terial should  be  avoided  until  sufficient  thickness  of 
fill  has  been  placed  to  reduce  the  possibility  of  punch- 
ing through  the  fill  into  the  mud. 

The  use  of  heavy  fill  materials  such  as  decomposed 
rock  is  not  advisable,  at  least  for  use  as  a  fill  blanket 
directly  over  the  mud.  Although  such  materials  would 
be  acceptable  once  in  place,  the  difficulty  of  placing 
is  almost  insurmountable.  Heavy  materials  such  as  de- 
composed rock  from  excavations  must  be  placed  by 
end-dumping,  and  it  is  this  method  that  is  objection- 
able and  invariably  gives  rise  to  the  creation  of  mud 
waves  throughout  the  fill  area.  The  type  of  fill  most 
suitable  for  this  purpose  is  sand,  either  quarry  or 
dredged.  It  is  pointed  out  that  satisfactory  placement 
of  sand  can  be  accomplished  by  bulldozers  and  does 
not  require  heavy  equipment  such  as  sheep's  foot 
and/or  heavy  rollers,  whereas  heavy  fill  material  can- 
not be  properly  placed  without  this  type  of  compac- 
tion equipment.  Once  a  firm  sand  blanket  has  been 
established,  other  select  fill  material  such  as  decom- 
posed rock  may  be  used  to  bring  the  fill  area  up  to 
the  desired  grade.  The  thickness  of  the  sand  blanket 
should  not  be  less  than  three  feet. 

Residence 

The  construction  methods  for  residential  fills  are 
similar  to  those  used  for  industrial  or  commercial  fill 
developments.  However,  since  the  avoidance  of  differ- 
ential settlement  in  residential  areas  is  of  utmost  im- 
portance, with  regard  to  streets,  utilities,  and  also 
building  foundations,  stricter  control  of  fill  quality 
and  method  of  placing  is  necessary.  Such  control  is 
also  necessary  for  the  prediction  of  future  behavior 
of  developments.  It  is  impracticable  to  support  residen- 
tial structures  on  piles  while  streets  and  adjacent  areas 
are  allowed  to  subside.  Foundation  support  for  residen- 
tial buildings  should  therefore  be  taken  upon  the  set- 
tling fill.  Residential  developments  on  fills  placed  upon 
bay  mud  are  the  most  exacting  of  all  the  possible  uses. 
Any  miscalculation,  faulty  placement,  or  undetected 
condition  may  result  in  rapid  deterioration  of  residen- 
tial subdivisions  beyond  practical  repair. 

For  the  specific  purpose  of  developing  mud  flats  for 
residential  subdivisions,  the  following  requirements 
are  deemed  necessary. 


(a)  The  first  fill  blanket  must  consist  of  well-grade 
granular  material,  carefully  placed.  The  method  &lt; 
placement  must  be  such  that  at  no  time  is  the  mi 
surface  distorted  or  broken  with  resulting  mud  wave 

(b)  Compaction  by  heavy  equipment  of  the  fir 
three-foot  fill  blanket  should  not  be  allowed.  The  onl 
material  that  can  be  thus  placed  without  future  shrinl 
age  of  the  fill  material  itself  is  either  windblown  sar 
or  dredged  sand.  Both  can  be  hydraulically  placed. 

(c)  The  rate  of  filling  should  not  be  in  excess  &lt;■ 
three  feet  a  year. 

(d)  Ultimate  elevations  and  slopes  should  be  ad&lt; 
quate  to  provide  drainage,  flood  control  and  safet 
against  tidal  waves. 

(e)  Settlement  markers  should  be  carefully  place 
and  read  at  regular  intervals  in  order  to  establish 
settlement  pattern. 

(f)  No  construction  should  start  prior  to  the  lap: 
of  five  years  after  the  fill  has  been  completed. 

Mat  Floating  Foundations 
Where  deep  excavations  are  to  be  made,  it  may  t 
feasible  to  take  advantage  of  the  relief  load  caused  b 
excavation.  Substituting  foundation  loads  of  high  ri:; 
buildings  for  the  weight  of  soil  thus  excavated  is  gei 
erally  referred  to  as  a  "floating"  foundation.  If  ti 
weight  of  the  building  is  exactly  equal  to  the  weigl 
of  soil  excavated,  inclusive  of  its  natural  water  cor 
tent,  the  stresses  at  the  level  of  the  building  found: 
tion  will  be  the  same  as  those  in  nature.  If  the  weigl 
of  the  building  is  less,  and  the  ground  water  table 
high,  the  stresses  will  be  less  than  those  in  the  natur. 
soil,  and  a  condition  may  even  be  created  whereb: 
the  building  may  tend  to  pop  out  of  the  ground.  . 
"floating"  foundation  is  usually  accomplished  by  pr&lt; 
viding  a  thick,  reinforced  concrete  slab  (mat)  at  tr, 
bottom  of  the  excavation,  and  the  building  columi 
are  supported  directly  on  the  mat.  The  periphery  wal 
that  then  extend  from  the  mat  to  the  ground  surfac 
constitute  the  basement  enclosures.  The  factors  th: 
will  determine  whether  any  stress  (upward  or  dowr 
ward)  exists  between  the  bottom  of  the  mat  and  tr 
soil,  will  depend  on:  (a)  the  weight  of  the  buildin 
and/or  the  weight  per  square  foot  of  the  building  i; 
the  foundation  level;  (b)  the  depth  of  excavation;  an&lt; 
(c)  ground  water  table.  Provisions  to  prevent  th 
building  from  "popping"  are  customarily  made  by  ei 
tending  the  mat  beyond  the  basement  periphery.  I 
the  case  of  the  building  weight  being  greater  than  th 
uplift  forces  of  the  water,  settlement  problems  cause 
by  the  semi-infinitely  loaded  area  may  be  critical;  th 
is  particularly  true  since  the  foundation  mat  is  prac 
tically  rigid  and  cannot  adjust  to  differential  settle 
ments  other  than  by  tilting.  Other  problems  must  b 
carefully  considered  in  the  design  of  such  a  founds 
tion,  some  of  which  are: 

(1)  Dewatering  the  building  site. 

(2)  Stabilization  of  adjacent  areas  during  construe 
tion. 

(3)  Prevention  of  heave  in  the  excavation  botton 

(4)  Careful  balancing  of  foundation  loads  with 
geometrical  configuration  of  the  building  to  pre 
vent  eccentricity  of  loading. 

(5)  Provision  against  tilting.

Lee  and  Praszker:  Bay  Mud  Developments 


51 


No  mat  for  a  major  building  is  known  to  have  been 
constructed  in  the  soft  bay  mud.  It  is,  however,  con- 
ceivable that  a  mat  foundation  for  a  large  building  with 
several  stories  of  basement,  could  penetrate  the  upper 
mud  and  be  founded  on  the  sandy  soils  directly 
underlying  it. 

The  effects  of  earthquakes  upon  this  type  of  foun- 
dation, as  compared  to  the  more  conventional  types, 
need  further  study  and  research.  It  is  noted  here  that 
the  embedment  of  the  mat  in  the  underlying  sand 
^ives  rise  to  at  least  three  different  vibration  systems: 
the  sand,  the  mud,  and  the  building. 

FOUNDATIONS  FOR  STRUCTURES 
LOCATED  ON  BAY  FILLS 

Foundation  support  for  any  structure  located  in  an 
»rea  which  is  subject  to  subsidence  must  be  established 
&gt;n  the  basis  of  the  expected  utility  and  performance 
;&gt;f  the  structure.  Almost  all  major  structures  are  sensi- 
ive  to  differential  settlements  which  affect  the  design 
Strength  as  well  as  stability  of  the  structure,  and  may 
(jlso  eat  away  the  built-in  safety  factor  which  is  to 
Safeguard  against  periodic  overstresses  such  as  would 
occur  during  an  earthquake.  Minor  structures  such  as 
residences  are  less  sensitive  to  differential  settlements, 
|&gt;ut  may  lose  much  of  their  property  value  due  to 
ugly  cracking  that  results  from  differential  settlements. 
'  From  what  has  preceded,  it  must  be  clear  that  uni- 
form settlement  of  freshly  placed  fills  on  bay  mud 
iannot  be  expected  under  ordinary  field  conditions, 
lor  can  the  amount  of  differential  settlement  be  com- 
muted on  a  rational  basis  unless  field  conditions  of  the 
inderlying  mud  and  the  manner  in  which  fills  are 
Placed  are  ideal.  Therefore,  allowance  must  be  made 
or  differential  settlements  of  a  detrimental  dimension 
p  the  case  of  freshly  placed  fills.  In  the  case  of  "well- 
easoned"  fills  the  amount  of  differential  settlement  can 
*e  determined  from  field  observations,  and  design 
eatures  may  be  incorporated  in  the  building  to  pro- 
vide for  such  settlements. 

It  is  therefore  deemed  necessary  to  abstain  from  any 
onsideration  of  building  foundations  on  newly  placed 
ay  fills  on  the  ground  that  there  are  too  many  inde- 
prminate  factors  involved  in  the  prediction  of  the 
Jture  behavior  of  such  fills.  With  regard  to  "well- 
;asoned"  fills  that  have  shown  a  certain  pattern  of 
ittlement  and  differential  settlement,  the  assumption 
an  be  made  that  future  settlements  after  construction 
f  buildings  will  be  slow  and  not  in  excess  of  six 
'iches,  nor  differential  settlements  in  excess  of  three 
iches  in  the  following  20  years. 
With  these  assumptions  one  may  proceed  to  pro- 
ide  foundation  support  for  the  buildings  themselves 
i  such  a  manner  that  any  additional  settlements  due 
)lely  to  the  weight  of  the  building  will  be  negligible, 
ecommendations  for  practical  and  sound  founda- 
ons  for  various  types  of  structures  cannot  be  made 
!  a  blanket  coverage;  a  foundation  or  soil  mechanics 
lgineer  should  be  consulted  for  each  individual  struc- 
ire.  Some  obvious  problems  involving  foundation 
;sign  are  being  outlined  for  guide  purposes  only. 


Residential  Houses 

A  conventional  spread  footing  foundation  with 
nominal  embedment  is  usually  satisfactory.  Provisions 
for  shimming  up  differential  vertical  deflections  (such 
as  by  installation  of  jacks)  should  be  provided  under 
all  footings. 

Industrial  and  Recreational  Buildings 

These  buildings  are  usually  of  large  dimension  and, 
although  one  or  two  stories  in  height,  may  be  called 
upon  to  carry  heavy  floor  loads.  For  two-story  build- 
ings with  heavy  upper  floor  loads,  piles  may  be  neces- 
sary, although  a  well-designed  grid-footing  founda- 
tion with  nominal  embedments  may  suffice.  Concrete 
slabs  on  ground  may  be  used,  provided  they  are  sep- 
arated from  the  foundation  footings.  Limitation  of 
integral  slab  dimensions  is  advisable. 

Piled  Foundations 

There  are  many  reasons  or  preferences  for  support- 
ing some  major  buildings  on  piles.  The  reasons  may  be 
purely  imperative  due  to  nonbearing  soils  underlying 
the  site  at  shallow  depths,  while  the  preferences  may 
have  to  do  with  economy  or  restrictions  on  allowable 
total  or  differential  settlements.  The  state  of  the  art  of 
pile  installation  is  in  the  process  of  developing  into 
a  science.  In  the  meantime,  there  have  been  a  number 
of  casualties  in  the  form  of  "sour"  buildings  that  have 
contributed  to  the  scientific  "post  mortems"  of  why 
piled  foundations  went  sour.  The  briefest  way  to  out- 
line the  deficiencies  of  some  pile  foundations  is  to 
enumerate  the  necessary  information  required  for  a 
good  foundation  design.  In  sequence  of  importance 
are  these  factors: 

1.  Thorough  test  boring  program  and  soils  engi- 
neering evaluation  of  soil  characteristics. 

2.  Ascertainment  of  satisfactory  soil  strata  within 
the  bearing  length  of  the  piles  as  well  as  below  the 
tip  elevation  of  the  piles. 

3.  Consideration  of  downdrag  on  the  pile  due  to 
fills  overlying  compressible  soils. 

4.  Engineering  supervision  by  soils  engineers  for 
every  pile  installed. 

The  case  history  of  the  Oakland  Auditorium  indi- 
cates that,  although  the  pile  foundation  was  con- 
structed in  accord  with  the  practice  of  the  time,  none 
of  the  above  factors  were  given  attention.  There  have 
been  more  dramatic  cases  of  pile  failures  which  were 
attributable  merely  to  a  single  factor.  Although  all 
pile  design  and  installation  have  similar  engineering 
requirements  regardless  of  location,  yet  where  piles  are 
driven  through  mud  into  superior  soil  strata,  the  sig- 
nificance of  all  the  four  factors  stated  above  becomes 
more  obvious. 

The  question  of  the  ability  or  inability  of  piles 
driven  through  mud  to  withstand  earthquake  forces 
has  been  debated  in  the  profession  for  many  years. 
Although  mud  is  a  semi-fluid  mass,  it  offers  consider- 
able resistance  to  impact  loads,  much  the  same  as  does 
water.  Moreover,  since  the  mud  itself  is  subjected  to 
vibrations,  the  embedded  pile  tends  to  vibrate  with  it. 
At  times  of  opposite  motion  the  mud  tends  to  flow 
around  the  pile,  but  no  failure  of  the  pile  is  likely  to 


52

[SR  9; 


occur  as  long  as  the  tip  of  the  pile  is  free  to  rotate. 
In  the  case  of  piles  driven  through  the  overlying  mud 
and  into  the  underlying  rock,  the  problem  may  be 
critical.  The  vibrating  mud  and  that  section  of  the  pile 
within  the  mud  may  cause  the  pile  to  shear  off  above 
the  rock  surface,  which  vibrates  in  an  absolutely  dif- 
ferent manner  from  the  mud  and  pile. 

Experience  with  pile  foundations  in  mud  areas  fol- 
lowing the  earthquake  of  1906  shows  that  quite  a 
number  of  buildings  on  pile  foundations  survived  the 
quake,  but  it  must  be  emphasized  that  none  of  those 
piles  was  embedded  in  the  underlying  rock.  A  recent 
trend  to  embed  piles  in  the  rock  has  been  noticed,  but 
it  will  have  to  be  seen  how  these  piles  behave  during 
a  heavy  earthquake,  before  final  conclusion  can  be 
reached. 

CASE  HISTORY  1. 

SAN  FRANCISCO  WATERFRONT 

By  CHARLES  H.   LEE,  Consulting  Engineer 

(Figures  follow  Page  58) 

The  San  Francisco  waterfront,  including  the  lower 
Market  Street  area  below  Montgomery  Street  from 
Telegraph  Hill  (Lombard  Street)  to  Rincon  Point 
(Harrison  Street),  is  on  filled  ground  placed  in  the 
former  Yerba  Buena  Cove.  The  area  of  the  fill  from 
the  original  bay  shoreline  of  1849,  which  skirts  First 
and  Montgomery  Streets,  to  the  existing  sea  wall  is 
256  acres;  the  maximum  width  1,200  feet  and  the 
length  7,000  feet  (figure  1). 

Yerba  Buena  Cove,  before  filling,  was  a  crescent- 
shaped  indentation  in  the  original  shoreline  and  in  early 
days  was  the  anchorage  area  for  most  of  the  shipping. 
The  original  community  of  Yerba  Buena  was  adjacent 
to  the  western  end  of  the  cove  and  surrounded  Ports- 
mouth Square  near  the  present  intersection  of  Colum- 
bus Avenue  and  Montgomery  Street.  At  low  tide  a 
broad  mud  flat  was  exposed  in  the  northern  portion 
of  the  cove  opposite  the  built-up  area,  but  in  the 
southern  portion  the  shore  was  sandy. 

San  Francisco  waterfront  is  underlain  by  10  to  100 
feet  of  soft  mud,  increasing  in  depth  toward  San  Fran- 
cisco Bay  (figure  2).  Below  the  mud  are  alluvial  beds 
of  silty  and  clayey  sands  and  sandy  firm  clay,  inter- 
bedded  with  stiff  marine  clays.  Bedrock  lies  at  depths 
varying  from  -20  feet  near  the  hills  to  -275  feet  MSL 
under  Mission  Street.  Bedrock  depths  are  greatest  in 
the  Fulton-Mission  Street  area  which  overlies  a  deep 
Franciscan  rock  ravine  or  canyon,  with  stream  chan- 
nel, which,  at  an  earlier  geological  age,  gathered 
surface  run-off  from  the  Hayes  and  Noe  Valley  drain- 
age areas  and  delivered  it  to  Sacramento-San  Joaquin 
River,  west  of  Alcatraz  Island  (figure  3). 

History  of  Fill 
Early  in  the  history  of  the  community  the  need  of 
wharfage  to  accommodate  unloading  of  ships  was  ap- 
parent.1 The  first  wharf  was  constructed  in  1847  at  the 

1  Historic  data  regarding  Yerba  Buena  Cove  fill  and  the  sea  wall  have  been 
obtained  largely  from  the  report  of  the  Subsoil  Committee,  San  Fran- 
cisco Section,  American  Society  of  Civil  Engineers  entitled  "Subsidence 
and  the  Foundation  Problem  in  San  Francisco"  September  1932, 
supplemented  by  research  at  the  Bancroft  Library  at  University  of 
California,  and  elsewhere. 


corner  of  Broadway  and  Battery  Streets.  Others  fol- 
lowed rapidly,  and  by  1850  total  wharfage  exceedec 
6,000  feet  in  length,  extending  from  500  to  900  feei 
into  the  bay  along  parallel  streets.  By  1854  the  tota 
length  had  increased  to  two  miles  including  cros; 
streets  supported  by  piles. 

The  first  fill  was  placed  at  Laguna  Salada,  a  pear 
shaped  salt  water  inlet  at  Jackson  and  Montgomery 
Street  which  extended  almost  to  Kearny  Street  (figure 
1).  The  Montgomery  Street  bridge  had  been  con| 
structed  across  the  outlet  in  1844,  but  in  1849  it  wa: 
replaced  with  a  fill  which  covered  the  whole  lagoon 
Filling  of  the  cove  was  accomplished  by  dumping 
from  wharves  and  cross-streets,  forming  dykes  whicl 
enclosed  square  ponds  of  stagnant  water  containing 
refuse  and  hulls  of  old  ships. 

Active  filling  of  "water  lots"  commenced  in  1 85' 
and  continued  until  1873.  The  first  "water  lot"  to  bi 
filled  was  on  California  Street  west  of  Battery.  Thi 
fill  material  consisted  of  dune  sand  with  an  admixturi 
of  rubbish,  building  rubble,  old  ship  hulls,  and  studde&lt; 
with  a  great  number  of  wooden  piles  which  original!) 
supported  wharves  constructed  while  the  area  was  stil| 
the  open  water  of  Yerba  Buena  Cove.  Much  of  the  nT 
material  was  excavated  in  the  Market  Street  area.  Larg' 
sand  dunes  existed  there,  one  between  Second  an&lt;! 
Third  Streets  exceeding  a  height  of  80  feet  (figure  2 
and  another  at  the  corner  of  Grant  Avenue  reaching  i 
height  of  89  feet  above  MSL.  Short  haul  transportatioi 
was  by  horse  and  cart,  long  haul  by  steamshovel  an&lt; 
small  railway  cars  moving  as  much  as  1500  cubic  yard 
per  day.  A  "steam  paddy"  imported  by  steamer  wa 
working  constantly  from  1852  to  1854  and  from  185' 
until  1873  loading  into  small  railway  cars  and  dumpinj 
into  the  water  lot  areas.  It  has  been  estimated  that  a 
much  as  22  million  cubic  yards  was  thus  placed.2  Sam 
fill  was  dumped  directly  into  the  water  without  com 
paction.  The  thickness  of  fill  as  finally  placed  variet 
from  25  feet  to  30  feet  along  and  to  the  north  o 
Market  Street,  but  south  of  Market  was  as  great  a 
40  feet  (figures  2  and  5). 

Sea  Wall  Construction 

The  insecurity  of  building  foundations  placed  dii 
rectly  upon  the  sand  fill  was  soon  apparent  as  evi 
denced  by  differential  settlement  with  cracking,  tip 
ping  and  breaking  up  of  buildings.  Erosion  fror 
storm  runoff  was  serious,  and  in  addition,  tidal  watei 
were  continually  eating  away,  washing  loose  sand  on 
into  the  deeper  waters  of  the  bay. 

In  "The  Annals  of  San  Francisco" 3  Frank  Soul 
pointed  out  the  absolute  necessity  of  a  great  sea  wa 
along  the  outer  front  of  the  harbor  to  protect  tr 
"beach  and  water  lots."  He  also  recommended  dee 
and  closely  spaced  piling  for  support  of  larger  buik 
ings  in  this  area.  In  the  Report  of  the  City  Surveyc 
of  San  Francisco,  dated  April  7,  1856,  a  sea  wall  cc 
structed  from  Rincon  Point  to  the  eastern  base 
Telegraph  Hill  was  declared  to  be  a  work  "immec 
ate  and  paramount  to  every  other  consideration."  Th 
State  Board  of  State  Harbor  Commissioners  was  crc|

Lee  and  Praszker:  Bay  Mud  Developments 


53 


ited  April  24,  1863  for  administration  of  the  Harbor 
?ront  and  by  1869  the  sections  of  wall  between  Mis- 
;ion  and  Pacific  Streets  and  between  Vallejo  and 
rJnion  Streets  were  completed.  The  alignment  was 
ingular  following  street  lines  along  the  then  "City 
"ront",  but  it  was  soon  discovered  that  great  quanti- 
fies of  "silt"  accumulated  in  the  angular  recesses.  This 
»vas  thought  to  have  been  caused  by  trapping  of  sedi- 
nent  discharged  into  the  bay  and  carried  along  the 
vaterfront  by  tidal  currents.  It  is  possible,  however, 
fhat  the  source  of  the  so-called  "silt"  was  bottom 
leave  of  the  underlying  mud  produced  by  the  weight 
)f  the  rock  fill  in  the  sea  wall  (figure  2).  It  was  de- 
eded to  remedy  this  situation  by  selecting  a  new  line 
beyond  the  existing  one,  conforming  to  bay  currents 
ind  lying  in  water  from  10  to  24  feet  in  depth.  Con- 
struction commenced  in  1878  and  by  1916  it  was  com- 
pleted from  the  east  side  of  Taylor  Street  to  southern 
county  line.  The  alignment  was  essentially  that  of  the 
present  sea  wall. 

The  original  sea  wall  consisted  of  quarry-run  rock 
obtained  largely  from  the  north  and  east  slopes  of 
telegraph  Hill,  and  dumped  "pell-mell"  along  the 
renter  line,  with  larger  rock  on  the  water  side  and 
prought  to  a  width  of  1 3  feet  at  mean  low  tide.  Prior 

0  constructing  the  rock  embankment  a  trench  was 
excavated  40  feet  wide  at  the  bottom,  20  feet  below 
nean  low  tide  (-22  feet  MSL).  The  fill  was  allowed 
,o  settle  for  several  months  until  a  "firm  foundation" 
|Vas  attained  and  then  topped  with  a  concrete  wall 
upported  by  wooden  piles.  All  contracts  were  com- 
pleted by  1869.  During  inspection  in  1871,  the  Harbor 
engineer  found  the  sea  wall  to  be  in  perfect  condi- 
tion with  no  evidence  of  lateral  movement,  and  settle- 
ment of  only  one  to  three  inches,  considered  to  be 
,iue  to  compacting  of  the  rock  fill. 

i  Plans  for  the  present  sea  wall  were  prepared  in  1878 
pased  upon  rather  complete  preliminary  boring  infor- 
xiation.  Along  the  Embarcadero  from  the  foot  of 
^owell  to  Pacific  Street  "soft  mud"  was  found  vary- 
ng  in  depth  from  4  to  a  maximum  of  15  feet,  below 
yhich  was  encountered  "stiff  mud."  (After  construc- 
ion  it  was  found  that  the  rock  fill  had  penetrated  into 
he  soft  mud  at  different  points  from  4.9  feet  to  a 
naximum  of  10.3  feet). 

Between  Pacific  Street  and  Harrison  Street  the 
iepth  of  soft  mud  was  much  greater.  Recent  borings

Prior  to  construction  of  the  present  sea  wall  a 
trench  20  to  30  feet  wide  at  the  bottom  was  excavated 
in  the  soft  mud  to  a  depth  varying  from  20  to  35  feet 
below  mean  low  water.  The  loose  broken-rock  em- 
bankment was  placed  in  this  trench  and  the  natural 
slope  of  the  material  under  water  was  carried  back 
to  low  water  level  on  the  water  side  and  City  Base 
on  the  shore  side.  The  width  of  the  embankment,  at 
the  level  20  feet  below  mean  low  tide,  was  100  feet. 
A  layer  4  feet  in  thickness  of  hand-laid  large  rock  was 
placed  on  the  water  slope  for  protection  against  wave 
action.  The  area  behind  the  wall  was  filled  with  de- 
fective or  soft  stone,  quarry  scrapings,  dune  sand,  and 
mud  dredged  up  from  the  waterfront.  After  settle- 
ment had  taken  place  the  area  behind  the  sea  wall  was 
paved  to  form  the  Embarcadero. 

Later,  after  construction,  it  was  found  that  with  the. 
ebb  and  flow  of  the  tide,  fill  material  from  behind  the 
wall  seeped  through  and  caused  settlement  of  the  pav- 
ing, particularly  in  the  area  between  Mission  and 
Brannan  Street.  To  correct  this  the  original  design  was 
modified  by  construction  of  a  pile-supported  concrete 
wall  at  the  center  of  the  fill  with  base  11.5  feet  wide 
at  elevation  —30  feet  San  Francisco  City  Datum  and 
top  at  street  level.6 

Settlement  of  Sea  Wall 

Settlement  rate  at  the  present  sea  wall  south  of  Har- 
rison and  north  of  Vallejo  Street  has  varied  from  0.02 
to  0.03  feet  per  year  except  in  the  piled  area  at  the 
Ferry  Building.  A  section  of  sea  wall  between  Harri- 
son and  Howard  Streets,  originally  brought  to  City 
Base,  settled  one  foot  over  a  weekend  with  lateral 
movement  of  1.5  foot  toward  the  bay.  Settlement  con- 
tinued, and  at  the  foot  of  Folsom  Street  by  1917 
amounted  to  a  maximum  of  4.5  feet  with  2  feet  of 
lateral  movement.  The  top  elevation  was  restored  to 
0.5  foot  below  City  Base  in  1917  but  settlement  con- 
tinued at  the  rate  of  0.2  to  0.3  foot  annually,  and  by 
1930  the  wall  had  settled  approximately  4  feet  from 
Folsom  Street  to  beyond  Howard  Street.  This  section 
was  restored  to  grade  elevation  in  1932.  Several  build- 
ings in  this  area  were  also  damaged.  The  old  Post  Of- 
fice Building  facing  Mission  Street  between  Spear  and 
Stewart  Streets  subsided  badly  and  unevenly  and  in 
1923  portions  of  the  buildings  had  to  be  raised  to 
original  grade. 

Settlement  of  Fill 

In  addition  to  settlement  along  the  sea  wall,  there 
has  been  settlement  of  the  main  body  of  the  sand  fill 
back  of  the  sea  wall.  The  most  spectacular  subsidence 
occurred  along  Market  Street  between  First  Street 
and  the  Embarcadero  at  the  time  of  the  earthquake  in 
1906  (photo  1).  A  maximum  settlement  of  3  feet  oc- 
curred at  Spear  Street  and  almost  2  feet  at  Beale  Street. 
The  street  was  brought  up  to  grade  after  the  earth- 
quake, but  slow  settlement  continued  amounting  by 
1923  to  from  0.5  foot  at  Main  Street  to  1.5  feet  at  the 
Embarcadero.  This  section  of  Market  Street  was  re- 
stored to  official  grade  in  1923,  but  settlement  has  con- 
tinued and  by  1955  was  1.8  feet  below  grade  at  the 
foot  of  Sacramento  Street  (figure  4).

Between  1925  and  1943  the  City  Engineer  made  rec- 
ords at  two-to-three-year  intervals  of  settlement  at  all 
street  intersections  located  in  known  areas  of  subsi- 
dence in  San  Francisco.  Detailed  study  has  been  made 
by  this  office  of  these  records  in  the  San  Francisco 
waterfront  area  for  the  purposes  of  this  report.  It  was 
found  that  settlement  was  most  rapid  in  a  strip  two  to 
four  blocks  wide  north  of  Market  Street  between  Em- 
barcadero  and  Montgomery  Street  (figure  1).  The  14- 
year  (1923  to  1936)  rate  of  settlement  in  this  area 
varied  from  .09  foot  per  year  at  the  Embarcadero  to 
.02  foot  per  year  at  Montgomery  Street,  the  accumu- 
lated total  settlements  at  these  respective  locations 
being  1.3  feet  and  0.3  foot.  In  other  portions  of  the 
fill  the  total  settlement  graded  off  to  0.1  foot  near  the 
margins  along  the  mean  high  water  line  of  1849.  At 
many  points  there  was  a  marked  decrease  in  rate  of 
settlement  after  the  year  1936  as  indicated  by  the  fact 
that  the  average  rate  of  settlement  at  62  street  inter- 
sections from  1923  to  1936  was  0.025  foot  per  year 
while  from  1936  to  1943  it  was  only  0.015  foot  per 
year.  Later  measurements  by  the  City  Engineer  indi- 
cate that  during  the  period  1945  to  1965  the  weighted 
average,  including  points  at  which  heave  occurred  was 
0.002  foot  per  year.  It  is  evident  from  examination  of 
the  records  that  active  settlement  over  much  of  the 
fill  eased  off  after  1936. 

Total  average  settlement  along  Market  Street  from 
Montgomery  Street  to  Spear  Street  from  1864,  the 
average  date  of  filling,  to  1964,  as  shown  by  Profile  B 
(figure  2),  was  9  feet.  Total  average  settlement  for 
the  first  100  years  as  computed  theoretically  from  fig- 
ures 1  and  2  of  the  main  report  is  4.32  feet.  The  great 
discrepancy  between  these  two  values  suggests  the 
possibility  that  an  appreciable  quantity  of  mud  has 
escaped  beyond  the  sea  wall  by  plastic  flow  into  San 
Francisco  Bay. 

Plastic  Flow  of  Mud 

The  possibility  that  settlement  of  the  surface  in  the 
San  Francisco  Waterfront  may  have  resulted  partially 
from  displacement  of  mud  by  plastic  flow  into  the  bay 
beyond  the  sea  wall  has  been  a  subject  of  discussion 
among  engineers  for  many  years.  Review  of  available 
information  as  of  present  date  indicates  the  possibility 
of  obtaining  an  answer  to  this  moot  question.  Recent 
engineering  reports  prepared  in  connection  with  the 
Golden  Gateway  Redevelopment  Project,7  and  San 
Francisco  Bay  Area  Rapid  Transit 8  contain  much 
pertinent  data.  These  data  together  with  those  in  other 
reports  and  those  shown  on  U.S.  Coast  and  Geodetic 
Survey  hydrographic  maps  of  1852,  1936  and  1958 
provide  sufficient  information  for  preliminary  quanti- 
tative studies,  such  as  shown  in  the  accompanying  ad- 
dendum. 

An  actual  instance  of  plastic  flow  of  mud  from 
under  a  filled  area  has  recently  been  investigated  by  a 
member  of  this  firm.  This  occurred  at  the  Anderson  &amp; 
Cristofani  Marine  Ways,  Innes  Avenue  and  Griffith

Street,  San  Francisco,  located  in  the  cove  on  the  north 
shore  of  Hunters'  Point.  This  boat  building  establish- 
ment has  been  in  operation  for  75  years  with  an  unob- 
structed entrance  channel  having  at  least  7  feet  depth 
at  low  water,  and  an  open  water  frontage  of  approxi- 
mately 500  feet.  Within  the  past  few  years  fill  has 
been  placed  upon  the  open  water  areas  both  to  the  i 
east  and  west.  The  fill  on  the  east  has  been  extended 
out  into  the  water  1000  feet  and  brought  up  to  an 
elevation  of  approximately  City  Datum.  On  the  westj 
fill  composed  of  contractor's  waste,  is  being  placed 
progressively  to  an  elevation  considerably  above  City 
Datum.  Concurrent  with  filling,  the  mud  bottom  ha; 
visibly  heaved  in  the  open  water  in  front  of  the  Ma- 
rine Ways,  necessitating  frequent  dredging  to  maintair 
the  entrance  channel.  This  condition  has  given  rise  to 
litigation. 

Another  well  known  instance  of  plastic  flow  of  muc 
is  at  the  Toll  Gate  Plaza,  San  Francisco-Oakland  Bay 
Bridge,  where  large  quantities  of  fill  have  been  placec] 
upon  soft  bay  mud  of  considerable  depth.  Plastic  flow 
of  mud  from  under  this  fill  has  occurred  with  exten- 
sive heaving  of  the  adjacent  bay  bottom,  particularly 
on  the  north  side  of  the  fill.  In  one  area  the  surface  oi 
mud  which  formerly  was  barely  exposed  at  low  water 
has  been  raised  by  heaving  to  an  elevation  several  fee1 
above  mean  high  water.9  This  area  overlies  a  deej 
mud-filled  valley  and  the  greatest  heaving  has  occurrec 
above  the  lowest  part  of  the  valley  where  the  mud  i 
the  thickest. 

These  recognized  instances  of  plastic  flow  of  muc 
beyond  the  margin  of  fills  and  corresponding  heavinj 
of  the  adjacent  bottom  of  the  bay  invite  study  of  th&lt; 
situation  at  the  San  Francisco  waterfront.  Profiles  I 
and  E   (figures  2  and   3)   accompanying  Appendix 
of  this  report  are  pertinent  to  such  a  study.  The) 
have  been  compiled  from  engineering  reports  recently 
submitted  to  the  San  Francisco  Rapid  Transit  Distric 
and  the  San  Francisco  Redevelopment  Agency,  am 
from  the  progressive  hydrographic  maps  of  San  Fran, 
cisco  Bay  issued  by  the  U.S.  Coast  and  Geodetic  Sur 
vey  beginning  in  1853.  These  two  profiles  lie  at  righ 
angles  to  each  other,  one  along  Market  Street  and  it 
projection  into  San  Francisco  Bay,  and  the  other  bet 
tween  Beale  &amp;  Main  Streets  from  Telegraph  Hill  t«i 
Rincon  Point.  They  show  the  elevation  of  the  surface 
of  the  mud  at  the  bottom  of  the  bay  as  it  was  in  \S5.t 
and  the  present  bottom  of  the  sand  fill  which  wa 
placed  thereon  during  the  succeeding  20  years.  Frorii 
these  and  other  similar  profiles  the  average  settlement 
has  been  computed  of  the  surface  of  the  mud  unde 
the  weight  of  the  fill  throughout  the  San  Franciso 
Waterfront  area  during  the  100-year  period  since  fii 
was  placed.  It  was  found  to  be  8.7  feet.10 

The  settlement  resulting  from  consolidation  of  th 
mud  by  squeezing  out  of  water  was  then  compute' 
from  the  measured  present  porosity  of  the  mud  a 
different  levels,  as  compared  with  the  porosity  at  simi 
lar  levels  in  1852.  The  latter  values  were  derived  b;

ne  at  Pier  14  in  San  Francisco  Bay,  800  feet  beyond 
le  sea  wall.  The  average  settlement  of  the  mud  by 
Dnsolidation  during  the  100-year  period  as  thus  com- 
uted  was  3.8  feet.11 

There  thus  appeared  to  be  an  unaccounted  for  dif- 
rence  of  8.7  —  3.8  =  4.9  feet.  Applying  this  amount 
&gt;  the  fill  of  256  acres  within  the  San  Francisco  Water- 
ont  area  results  in  a  volume  of  unaccounted  for  set- 
ement  of  1256  acre  feet.  There  is  a  possibility  that 
lis  volume  represents  mud  which  has  been  displaced 
om  under  the  fill  by  plastic  flow  out  into  the  open 
ly.  There  is  much  to  support  this  proposition. 
Prior  to  the  sea  wall  construction  and  between  1853 
id  1859  frequent  soundings  to  the  mud  were  made 
the  open  water  along  existing  wharves  beyond  the 
ity  Front  and  beyond  any  sandfilled  area.12  These 
undings  indicated  a  progressive  rise  in  the  mud  bot- 
&gt;m  beginning  in  1853  which  by  1859  amounted  to  as 
uch  as  20  feet  at  the  end  of  the  wharves,  and  pro- 
iced  a  pronounced  "bowing  out"  of  depth  contours 
:yond  those  of  1853.

Filling  of  "water  lots"  within  the  city  commenced 
L  1852  and  continued  actively  into  the  late  1860's.  The 
oserved  heaving  of  the  bay  bottom  beyond  the  front- 
se  limit  of  the  city  appears  to  be  the  result  of  this 
fling,  since  the  fill  did  not  extend  beyond  the  front- 
ae  limit,  and  since  an  adequate  source  of  silt  was  not 
sailable  for  deposition  by  tidal  currents  (figures  1  and 
t.  Such  heaving  could  only  result  from  plastic  flow 
(  mud  from  beneath  the  fill  toward  the  deeper  un- 
cnfined  mud  area  beneath  the  bay. 

Since  construction  of  the  present  sea  wall,  constant 
(edging  of  the  berthing  space  between  piers  has  been 
rcessary  to  maintain  draft  depth  for  ships  at  low 
tie.  This  would  indicate  a  continuation  of  the  heaving 
jocess  since  there  is  no  continuing  active  local  source 
c  silt  available  for  tidal  currents  to  pick  up  and  carry 
a&gt;ng  the  waterfront. 

"?e  Addendum,  Appendix  1,  for  details. 

'lap  of  the  city  front  and  profiles  of  wharves  showing  the  progress  of 
filling,  from  the  Report  and  Condition  Requirements  of  the  City  of 
San  Francisco  by  James  P.  Robinson,  1859.  Original  map  in  possession 
of  Bancroft  Library  at  University  of  California. 


Examination  of  the  successive  hydrographic  maps  of 
San  Francisco  Bay  published  by  the  U.S.  Coast  and 
Geodetic  Survey  and  its  predecessor  the  U.S.  Coast 
Survey,  beginning  in  1853,  shows  that  over  the  years 
there  has  been  a  progressive  "bowing  out"  of  depth 
contours  opposite  the  former  Yerba  Buena  Cove  ex- 
tending at  the  present  time  even  beyond  the  60  feet 
depth  below  mean  low  water  (figure  7).  In  order  to 
evaluate  the  extent  of  the  rise  in  the  bottom  of  the  bay 
at  various  dates,  five  profiles  of  the  bay  bottom  have 
been  drawn.  Profiles  A  and  C  which  follow  the  limit- 
ing points  of  inflection  of  the  "bowing"  indicate  but 
minor  changes  in  bottom  elevation  (figures  8  and  9). 
Profiles  B,  F  and  G  which  traverse  the  "bowed  out" 
area  (figures  2  and  10)  indicate  significant  rise  in  bot- 
tom elevations  extending  almost  to  the  80  foot  depth 
contour.  Computation  of  the  volume  represented  by 
the  rise  in  the  bottom  of  the  bay  is  summarized  in  the 
following  table  using  values  scaled  from  the  profiles 
and  applying  to  the  period  1852  to  1938  embracing 
the  period  from  commencement  of  filling  to  end  of 
appreciable  settlement. 

The  resulting  volume  of  1385  acre  feet  is  closely 
equivalent  to  1250  acre  feet,  the  volume  of  unac- 
counted settlement  in  the  fill.  If  plastic  flow  has  oc- 
curred, it  is  possible  that  after  release  from  the  sur- 
charge of  the  fill  the  mud  has  reabsorbed  water  and 
attained  a  void  ratio  approaching  that  of  the  uncon- 
fined  soft  mud  encountered  in  the  test  boring  at  the 
head  of  Pier  14.  If  the  above  calculated  volume  of 
1385  acre  feet  be  adjusted  to  the  void  ratio  of  the 
first  15  feet  of  mud  under  the  fill,  the  resulting  volume 
is  1110  acre  feet.  If  this  volume  is  assumed  to  have 
passed  through  the  vertical  mud  section  under  the  sea 
wall  of  270,000  square  feet  (figure  5)  during  the  pe- 
riod 1860  to  1960  the  average  rate  of  flow  would  have 
been  1.8  feet  per  year. 

It  is  concluded  from  these  studies  that  general  move- 
ment of  mud  by  plastic  flow  has  occurred  from  be- 
neath the  San  Francisco  waterfront  fill  and  that  mi- 
grated mud  now  lies  beneath  the  water  of  the  open  bay

beyond  the  sea  wall.  The  extent  to  which  movement 
under  the  sea  wall  has  taken  place  since  1938  is  doubt- 
less much  less  than  previously,  although  there  has 
probably  been  readjustment  with  local  movement  of 
accumulated  mud  under  the  bay.  There  is  possibility 
of  renewal  of  general  movement  following  a  major 
earthquake  accompanied  by  important  local  settlement 
within  the  filled  area  such  as  occurred  in  1906  (photo 
1).  Such  possibility  might  be  the  subject  of  further 
more  detailed  investigation. 

Computations  in  Re  Plastic  Flow  of  Mud, 
San  Francisco  Waterfront 

As  a  basis  for  these  computations  pertinent  data 
have  been  compiled  from  various  available  engineering 
reports.  Data  applying  to  subsurface  materials  under- 
lying Market  Street  as  compiled  from  Rapid  Transit 
reports  are  as  follows:13 

Natural  Dune  Sand: 

1.  Fine  sand  above  water  table,  uncompacted  (av- 
erage 15  samples  Van  Ness  Avenue  to  8th  Street). 

— dry  weight  100  pounds  cubic  foot 
— void  ratio  0.63 

2.  Fine  sand  below  water  table,  naturally  compacted 
(average  5  samples  8th  Street  to  4th  Street).

4ote:  Thickness  of  sand  fill  is  25  to  30  feet;  depth  to  water  table  is  8  feet  along 
Embarcadero  to  approximately  13  feet  along  First  and  Battery  Streets. 

Assuming  that  3.8  feet,  the  average  of  these  two 
lues,  is  representative  of  the  whole  filled  area,  the 
icrease  in  volume  within  the  245  acre  fill  area  due 
consolidation  has  been  computed  to  be  965  acre 
et.  This  consolidation  can  be  considered  as  having 
curred  during  the  100-year  period  1860  to  1960. 
Total  settlement  of  the  San  Francisco  waterfront 
curring  since  1852  can  be  obtained  by  comparison  of 
e  profile  elevations  of  the  bottom  of  Yerba  Buena 
)ve  in  1852  before  filling,16  and  profile  elevations  of 
e  bottom  of  sand  fill  at  the  present  time.  The  latter 
available   at   four   locations,    one   along   Market 


Street,17  one  near  the  Embarcadero  at  right  angles  to 
Market  Street,18  one  from  Broadway  to  Mission  Street 
between  Main  and  Beale  Streets  at  right  angles  to 
Market  Street,19  and  one  from  Kearny  near  California 
Street  to  Embarcadero  parallel  to  Market  Street.20 
These  profiles  have  been  reproduced  herein  as  figures 
2,  3,  5  and  8,  showing  both  original  bottom  in  1852, 
the  present  bottom  of  the  sand  fill,  and  present  street 
grades. 

The  average  settlement  of  the  sandfill  indicated  by 
each  of  these  profiles  has  been  taken  from  them  with 
the  following  results: 

Kearny  Street  to  Embarcadero  at  Broadway 

(Profile  A)  4.8  ft. 

Market  Street  (Montgomery  to  Embarca- 
dero) (Profile  B) 9.0  ft. 

Embarcadero  (Vallejo  to  Harrison)  (Profile 

D)  9.7  ft. 

Beale  and  Main  Sts.  projected  to  Broadway 

(Profile  E) 10.0  ft. 


weighted  average  total  settlement     8.7  ft. 

It  is  to  be  noted  that  this  quantity  much  exceeds  the 
settlement  by  consolidation  previously  computed  to 
be  3.8  feet,  the  unaccounted  for  difference  amounting 
to:  8.7  feet  —  3.8  feet  =  4.9  feet.  This  amount  applied 
to  the  fill  area  of  256  acres  gives  a  volume  of  unac- 
counted for  settlement  of  1250  acre  feet.

This  fill  was  placed  upon  Yerba  Buena  Shoals,  a 

sallow  water  area  exceeding  735  acres,  lying  north 

i  Yerba  Buena  Island  in  San  Francisco  Bay.  A  small 

(irtion   of  the   area,   extending  from  the  northwest 

Jint  of  Yerba  Buena  Island,  was  a  sand  spit,  awash 

low  tide  near  the  island,  but  deepening  to  18  feet 

low  Mean  Lower  Low  Water  at  a  distance  of  7,000 

t.  Skirting  the  sand  spit  on  the  east  and  north,  at  a 

|  pth  of  18  to  25  feet  below  MLLW,  was  a  soft  bay 

ud  deposit  overlying  the  deeply  buried  former  chan- 

:l  and  ravine  of  Temescal  Creek.  This  was  a  major 

I  earn  draining  the  east  bay  hills  which,  at  an  earlier 

jologic    period,    flowed    northwesterly   to    join   the 

i:ramento-San  Joaquin  River  north  of  Angel  Island. 

lie  full  depth  of  this  mud  was  not  determined  by 

i:al  borings,  but  extrapolations  from  adjacent  borings 

ng   the    line    of   the    San   Francisco-Oakland    Bay 

Idge  indicate  the  elevation  of  the  ravine  bottom  to 

■  95  feet  below  MLLW.1 

Treasure  Island  occupies  the  sand  spit  and  extends 
t  into  the  mud  area  between  the  southeast  and 
thwest  corners  of  the  fill.  The  above-water  area 
the  fill  is  approximately  400  acres,  3410  feet  in 
1th  and  5520  feet  in  length,  of  which  65  percent 
s  underlain  by  fine  to  coarse  loose  sand,  occasionally 
;rbedded  with  soft  sandy  mud,  mud  with  sand, 
dy  clay  or  clay;  and  35  percent  underlain  by  soft 
d  (figure  1).  Grade  elevation  of  the  fill  was  +13 
t  above  MLLW  and  that  of  the  sea  wall  was  +14 
:. 

n  the  design  stage  there  were  two  concepts  for 
function  and  composition  of  the  sea  wall.  The 
K  was  to  place  a  sand  mound  perimeter  up  to  ele- 
ion  zero,  on  top  of  which  the  stone  levee  would 
constructed  to  final  grade  elevation  at  +14  feet, 
is  to  act  as  a  retaining  wall  for  the  fill.  Where  un- 
lying  material  was  soft  along  the  east  and  north 
s  and  at  the  southeast  and  northwest  corners,  a  pre- 
nary  trench  was  to  be  excavated  and  backfilled 
K  sand.  Sea  wall  construction  was  to  commence  at 
south  end  of  the  fill  and  extend  north  in  the  form 
a  U,  leaving  the  north  end  open  for  escape  of 
•ended  fines  from  the  dredger  fill  and  also  soft  mud 
laced  as  plastic  flow  by  the  weight  of  the  advanc- 
sand  fill. 

he  other  concept  visualized  the  rock  wall  as  a 
ining  dike  for  the  sand  fill  during  construction,  to 
)laced  in  stages  as  the  filling  progressed,  and  after 
&gt;truction  to  act  as  backing  for  a  uniform  riprapped 
e  from  elevation   —6  to  elevation   4-14  feet,  the 

Francisco  Bay  Exposition  Co.  Report  on  Sub-Aqueous  Material  Under-

latter  to  afford  protection  for  the  slopes  against  wave 
action.  This  plan  omitted  placing  of  a  sand  blanket 
upon  the  mud  beneath  the  sea  wall  and  provided  for 
complete  enclosure  of  the  proposed  fill  area  with  small 
spillway  only  at  the  north  end.  Class  "B"  rock  was  to 
be  used  in  the  sea  wall  consisting  of  quarry  run  rock, 
maximum  size  1,000  pounds,  50  percent  weighing  200 
pounds  or  more,  not  more  than  20  percent  3  pounds 
or  less.  By  reason  of  financial  arrangements  this  second 
plan  prevailed. 

Two  experiences  during  construction  are  note- 
worthy.2 Shortly  after  completion  of  the  east  sea  wall 
a  section  500  feet  long,  near  the  northerly  end,  sud- 
denly settled  10  to  14  feet  and  disappeared  from  sight. 
As  a  result,  construction  plans  were  modified  by  flat- 
tening the  side  slopes  of  the  wall  and  depositing  a  mat- 
tress of  heavy  sand  (138  pounds  per  cubic  foot)  on 
the  bottom  beyond  the  toe  of  the  slope  to  act  as 
counter-weight  and  prevent  the  underlying  plastic 
mud  from  heaving  and  thus  causing  further  settlement 
in  the  fill.  The  north  sea  wall  was  also  modified  by 
trenching  for  a  width  of  400  feet  to  a  depth  of  20 
to  30  feet  into  the  mud  bottom  and  immediately  back- 
filling with  heavy  sand  before  placing  the  first  course 
of  the  sea  wall. 

As  the  marginal  dikes  neared  completion,  extremely 
fine  semiliquid  mud  (85  percent  passing  a  325  mesh 
screen)  began  to  accumulate  in  a  kidney-shaped  area 
ahead  of  the  sand  fill,  amounting  at  one  time  to  1,500,- 
000  cubic  yards.  Toward  the  end  of  the  filling  oper- 
ation, with  less  than  400,000  cubic  yards  to  be  placed, 
this  mud  "stiffened"  and  would  neither  move  ahead 
through  the  spillway  nor  permit  itself  to  be  covered

by  sand.  Instead,  it  kept  heaving  until  the  elevation  of 
:he  top  was  5  feet  above  project  grade.  All  filling  op- 
erations were   then  suspended  and   a   small  portable 
dredge  was  installed  within  the  sea  wall  to  remove  the 
Tapped  mud.  The  small  dredge  advanced  southward 
"rom  the  north  edge  of  the  mud  area,  digging  to  a 
iepth  of  6  and  12  feet  into  the  mud.  Filling  operations 
jvere  then  resumed  and  as  mud  built  up  in  front  of 
he  fill,  it  was  removed  by  the  small  dredge  as  rapidly 
its  it  accumulated.  A  total  of  approximately  130,000 
:ubic  yards  of  mud  was  thus  removed  and  it  was 
eported  that  no  soft  spots  remained. 
The  nature  of  the  fill  was  determined  soon  after 
ompletion  from  samples  and  logs  of  more  than  100 
uger  holes  drilled  to  10  feet  maximum  depth.3  The 
ill  was  found  to  be  composed  of  layered  dredger-sand 
vith  frequent  admixture  of  broken  shell  and  occasional 
vind  rows  of  clay  balls  in  a  sand  matrix.  The  predomi- 
nant texture  was  fine  sand,  occasionally  clayey,  with 
&gt;cal  areas  of  medium  to  coarse  sand  and  gravelly  sand, 
j'here  were  occasional  thin  beds  of  clay  of  irregular 
xtent  representing  fines  which  settled  out  in  isolated 
ools  of  muddy  water  during  dredger  operations. 
'  Of  the  fine  sand,  95  percent  or  more  was  held  on 
he  150  mesh  sieve.  Of  the  blue  clay  balls  (marine), 
Hnlv  2  percent  was  retained  on  the  200  mesh  sieve, 
'hile  70  percent  of  the  clayey  sand  balls   (alluvial) 
as  retained  on  the  200  mesh  sieve.  The  clay  balls 
^presented  chunks  of  cohesive  (marine)  or  semi-co- 
;sive   (fresh-water  alluvial)   derived  from  clay  beds 
Jjithin  the  sand,  as  excavated  by  dredging,  which  were 
•unded   in   passing  through   the   delivery  pipe   line, 
he  dry  weight  of  sand  fill  ran  95  to  100  pounds  per 
ibic  foot,  void  ratio  0.75  to  0.80  and  permeability 
jtf  to  283  gallons  per  square  foot  per  24  hours  at  100 
pcent  gradient  and  60°  F.  temperature.  Clay  balls 
jjn  60  to  65  pounds  per  cubic  foot  dry  weight  and 
J 164  void  ratio.  They  were  impermeable. 
Total  volume  of  material  handled  bv  dredges  was 
:',382,000   cubic    yards    of   which    20^947,000    cubic 
nrds,  or  71.5  percent,  was  retained  as  fill,  the  remain- 
fcr  being  lost  either  by  tidal  current  erosion,  or  by 
Station  of  fines.  The  loss  of  sand  by  erosion  has  been 
('nservatively  estimated  as  100,000  cubic  yards.  Heavy 
Jid  deposited  from  hoppers  outside  the  easterly  sea 
'ill  was  found  to  have  penetrated  9  feet  below  origi- 
tl  bottom.

peted Julv  2,  1937,  except  for  refill  operations  August 
Ito  24,  1937.  Fill  material  was  obtained  from  various 
iurces,  as  follows:

Figure  2.     Typical  rate  of  settlement  curves.  Treasure  Island  fill,  1937  to  1964. 


Typical  rate  of  settlement  curves  have  been  plotted 
from  this  data  representative  of  the  southwest,  north- 
west and  southeast  portions  of  the  fill  (figure  2).  In 
the  southwest  portion,  where  19  feet  of  sand  fill  was 
placed  upon  sand  bottom,  settlement  has  been  the 
least  and  had  practically  ceased  by  1956  when  it 
amounted  in  total  to  3.23  feet.  Most  of  the  settlement 
took  place  during  the  first  7  years. 

In  the  northwest  portion,  where  30  feet  of  clay  and 
sand  fill  was  placed  upon  deep  mud  bottom,  total 
settlement  to  1960  has  amounted  to  5.26  feet  with  a 
current  rate  of  settlement  of  0.063  foot  per  year.  Most 
of  the  settlement  occurred  during  the  first  four  years. 

In  the  southeast  portion,  where  35  feet  of  sand  fill 
was  placed  upon  mud  bottom,  total  settlement  has 
been  4.23  feet  with  a  current  rate  (projected)  of  0.04 
foot  per  year.  Most  of  the  settlement  occurred  during 
the  first  five  years. 

Back  of  the  east  sea  wall  where  the  sand  counter- 
weight was  placed  outside  of  the  wall,  the  settlement 
rate  1947  to  1956  was  nominal  indicating  complete 
stability.  Back  of  the  west  sea  wall,  settlement  during 
the  same  period  was  at  a  rate  of  twice  that  for  the 


main  fill,  indicating  the  occurrence  of  sand  seepa; 
through  the  rock  levee  induced  by  exposure  to  hea- 
wave  action.  Local  areas  of  excessive  sand  seepaj 
occurred  here  during  the  exposition  and  were  bac 
filled.

re  designated  by  the  Navy  as  Buildings  Nos.  361,  364, 
65  and  368  through  371  and  are  all  used  for  storage 
f  supplies. 

Prior  to  approximately  1925  the  area  now  occupied 
y  the  Supply  Annex  was  part  of  a  tidal  marsh  with 
oughs  as  shown  in  figure  1.  Between  the  years  1925 
nd  1929  the  area  (as  well  as  adjacent  areas)  was  filled 
y  intermittent   dredger   fill   generally   consisting   of 

feet  to  14  feet  in  thickness  of  gray,  silty  clay  with 
liinor  admixtures  of  sand,  and  a  sand  topping  4  feet 
p  8  feet  thick  as  shown  on  figures  2  and  3.  All  this 
fll  was  placed  on  the  marshlands  and  sloughs  which 
lrere  underlain  by  soft  mud,  characteristic  of  San 
rancisco  Bay,  to  varying  depths  as  shown  on  figures 

and  3.  Figure  1  shows  the  mud  thickness  contours 
rhich  thickness  includes  mud  fill,  all  as  obtained  from 
:st  boring  data.  It  is  to  be  noted  that  the  thread  of 
■  mud-filled  ravine  approximately  parallels  the  north 
oundary  of  the  Supply  Annex  and  extends  eastward 
id  westward  thereof.1  No  fill  has  been  placed  in  this 
meral  area  since  1929. 

In  1929  The  San  Francisco  Bay  Airdrome,  Inc., 
ased  the  property  from  the  then  owner,  the  Univer- 
:y  of  California.  Two  structures  were  built  by  the 

irdrome  in  1930-31,  one  of  which  remains  as  build- 
.g  No.  365;  the  other  has  been  cut  in  half  and  moved 
|:id  is  now  building  No.  364.  The  airdrome  was  in 
oeration  until  1941.  Between  the  years  1941  and  1953 
l.e  Navy  acquired  the  property  and  in  1953  completed 
ke  construction  of  buildings  Nos.  368-371.  This  his- 
rtry  relates  in  particular  to  these  four  buildings  and 
hilding  No.  365. 

Building  365. 

Building  365  was  constructed  by  San  Francisco  Air- 
borne, Inc.,  in  1930-31.  Only  the  structure  was  sup- 
prted  on  piles,  the  floor  having  been  constructed  on 
jade.  The  structure  is  in  relatively  good  condition 
Id  inasmuch  as  the  building  is  on  piles  it  can  be 
turned  that  the  structure  itself  has  not  undergone 
jpreciable  settlement,  although  photo  1  shows  slight 
■evenness  of  hangar  door  trackway  due  to  differen- 
30.1  settlement  of  approximately  4  inches.  However, 
«e  grounds  around  the  building  have  settled  approxi- 
mely  2.25  feet  below  the  elevation  of  1930-31  as 
sown  in  photo  2.  Photos  1  and  2  also  show  remedial 
■vDrk  which  has  been  done  to  provide  entrance  to  the 
Hiding.  In  1962  the  Navy  completed  a  reconstruc- 
t&gt;n  of  the  interior  floor  which  had  settled  to  a  maxi- 
nm  of  3  feet  due  to  imposed  storage  loads.  This  con-

te  building  floor  to  the  level  of  1930-31,  as  indicated 
I  column  bases  and  door  runway.  Following  recon- 
suction,  settlement  readings  were  taken  for  three 
&gt;ars  from  which  settlement  contours  have  been 
Own  as  shown  on  figure  4,  indicating  a  maximum 
SDsidence  of  0.8  foot.  It  is  to  be  noted  that  this  settle-

but  also  to  the  weight  of  the  material  stored  in  the 
warehouse.  The  load  which  caused  this  settlement  can- 
not be  estimated.  Assuming  a  similar  loading  condition 
to  obtain  in  the  future  as  that  which  caused  the  above 
three-year  settlement,  a  settlement-time  curve  has  been 
prepared  which  shows  an  estimated  maximum  subsid- 
ence of  1.4  feet  by  the  year  1971.  Photo  3  shows  the 
new  floor  breaking  away  from  the  portion  of  the 
floor  constructed  over  the  pile  cap  which  supports  the 
building  column. 

Buildings  368-371 

In  1953  buildings  368-371  were  completed.  These 
also  are  supported  on  piles  except  for  their  floors 
which  are  supported  on  grade.  Settlement  readings 
were  taken  on  the  floors  for  9  years  and  indicated 
an  average  subsidence  of  approximately  1.25  feet  and 
a  maximum  of  1.68  feet.  This  subsidence  was  due  to 
the  building  floor  pad  fill  varying  from  2  to  5  feet 
in  thickness  and  the  weight  of  the  materials  stored. 
At  present  the  average  settlement  is  approximately 
1.5  feet  as  shown  in  photo  4  which  was  taken  at  an 
outside  building  corner.  An  interesting  feature  of  these 
buildings  is  that  the  settlement  was  anticipated  as  was 
the  fact  that  it  would  cause  settlement  for  some  dis- 
ance  beyond  the  limits  of  the  building.  In  order  to 
provide  proper  drainage  of  surface  water  after  settle- 
ment, the  exterior  concrete  slab  was  sloped  away  from 
the  building.  This  can  be  seen  in  photo  5  where  a 
portion  of  the  concrete  slab  settled  for  some  distance 
and  then  "hung-up"  on  the  grade  beam  and  has  broken 
away  from  the  remainder  of  the  slab  which  followed 
the  ground  surface  further  downward.  Extensive  re- 
pairs have  been  made  for  this  condition  as  indicated 
by  asphalt  paving  adjacent  to  the  buildings  as  shown 
on  photos  4,  6,  7  and  9.  (Photo  8  shows  the  concrete 
slab  intact.) 

Photos  6,  7,  8  and  9  show  repairs  at  entrance  to  the 
building  to  correct  for  the  ground  settlement  that 
has  taken  place.  In  photo  7  note  that  the  pedestrian 
doorway  is  no  longer  in  use. 

A  time  settlement  analysis  for  these  building  floors 
indicates  that  they  could  settle  as  much  as  2  V4  feet 
by  1976  if  a  similar  loading  pattern  continues  as  existed 
for  the  9-year  period  during  which  readings  were 
taken. 

An  interesting  phenomenon  took  place  during  the 
first  two  years  after  completion  of  the  buildings  in 
the  eastern  quarter  of  the  area  between  buildings  370 
and  371,  namely  that  the  ground  surface  actually 
heaved  3  inches.  This  was  due  to  an  overloading  of 
the  mud  underlying  the  building  floors  causing  it  to 
flow  plastically  towards  the  non-loaded  area  between 
the  buildings. 

In  conclusion  it  must  be  pointed  out  that  these 
buildings  have  remained  functional  in  spite  of  the  set- 
tlement of  the  surrounding  and  interior  areas  because 
it  was  anticipated  and  the  design  made  accordingly.

CASE  HISTORY  4.  CITY  OF  OAKLAND 

MUNICIPAL  AUDITORIUM 
By  CHARLES  H.   LEE,  Consulting  Engineer

85  Table  2.     Test  boring  records,  Oakland  Auditorium — 1934. 

Piles  for  support  of  this  building  were  driven  in 
1912  and  the  erection  of  the  superstructure  was  com- 
pleted in  1914.  The  building  is  200  by  400  feet  in  plan 
and  is  located  entirely  within  the  soft  bay  mud  area 
adjacent  to  Lake  Merritt  outlet.  The  mud  beneath  the 
building  is  25  to  46  feet  in  thickness.  It  is  underlain 
by  alternating  thin  beds  of  blue  clay,  sand  and  gravel 
of  aggregate  thickness  of  26  to  46  feet.  Below  this  is  a 
hard  marly  blue  clay  designated  "good  soil"  by  the 
engineer  who  inspected  test  borings  drilled  in  1934 
after  serious  differential  settlement  had  occurred. 

The  walls  and  roof  of  the  building  are  supported  on 
pile  clusters  placed  beneath  column  footings,  each 
cluster  consisting  of  12  to  24  piles  spaced  on  3-foot 
centers.  The  roof  is  supported  by  steel  frame  arches, 
three-hinged,  pin  connected  with  a  span  of  200  feet 
and  spring  line  at  level  of  top  balcony  seats.  The 
arches  are  supported  by  the  steel  wall  frame.  The 
main  floor  is  supported  by  piles  3  feet  apart  in  pairs 
spaced  on  17-foot  centers  in  both  directions.  All  piles 
were  driven  to  20  tons  capacity  as  determined  by  the 
Engineering  News  formula,  in  common  use  at  that 
time.  No  test  borings  were  made. 

Initial  elevations  were,  top  of  piles  +  2.5  feet,  top 
of  concrete  capping  for  columns  +  5.25  feet,  and  for 
floor  supports  +  7.5  feet,  and  main  floor  level  +  19 
feet.1  Original  average  ground  surface  was  +  9.5  feet 
(+  H.3  feet  MSL)  but  was  excavated  to  +  2.0  feet 
around  piles  in  order  to  make  cutoffs  and  place  con-

Sea  Level. 


crete  cappings.  This  permitted  tidal  waters  to  enter 
the  area  beneath  the  floor  at  high  tide. 

Soon  after  completion  a  horse  show  was  held  in 
the  Auditorium  and  to  protect  the  floor  one  foot  of 
soil  was  spread.  After  the  close  of  the  fair  this  was 
dropped  through  trap  doors  onto  the  irregular  mud 
surface  below.  Soon  thereafter,  dredger  sand  was 
placed  beneath  and  around  the  building  raising  the 
general  surface  elevation  beneath  the  building  to  at 
least  -\-  9.5  feet,  and  outside  several  feet  higher. 

Soon  after  filling,  serious  settlement  of  the  building 
occurred  with  spreading  of  the  walls,  necessitating 
emergency  repairs  which  included  the  stringing  of 
cables  across  the  building  to  stabilize  the  arches.  Very 
active  settlement  continued  for  several  years,  after 
which  it  gradually  decreased  but  was  still  appreciable

In   1934  six  test  borings  were  drilled  around  the 
periphery  of  the  auditorium,  one  at  the  west  end, 
two  at  the  center  and  three  at  the  east  end.  The  logs 
of  these  test  borings  revealed  the  cause  of  the  unequal 
settlement  of  the  building,  namely,  that  in  the  portion 
of  the  building  where  least  settlement  occurred  (west 
lend)  the  tips  of  piles  penetrated  the  "good  soil"  (hard 
j marly  blue  clay),  while  in  the  remainder  of  the  build- 
ing piles  "took  up"  in  the  gravel  and  clay  strata.  Thus 
i where  settlement  was  least  the  piles  had  end  bearing 


in  the  "good  soil",  in  addition  to  friction  in  the  over- 
lying gravel  and  clay,  while  in  the  remainder  of  the 
building  there  was  friction  only.  The  following  table 
presents  details  of  the  test  boring  logs  and  original 
elevations  of  adjacent  pile  tips. 

The  weight  of  the  fill  material  placed  under  the 
building  after  completion  greatly  exceeded  that  of  the 
mud  excavated  during  construction  and  apparently 
this  added  weight  was  transferred  in  part  by  skin 
friction  to  the  piles.  Those  piles  at  the  west  end  of 
the  building  which  penetrated  the  "good  soil"  experi- 
enced relatively  minor  settlement,  but  others  which 
penetrated  only  the  gravel  and  clay  deposits,  espe- 
cially those  at  the  east  end  of  the  building,  experienced 
settlement  three  to  four  times  as  great  as  those  at  the 
west  end.  Not  only  were  relative  settlements  great 
but  total  settlements  were  in  terms  of  feet  rather  than 
in  fractions  of  inches  which  are  ordinarily  considered 
tolerable.  The  arch  type  of  construction  which  sup- 
ported the  roof  was  particularly  vulnerable  to  exces- 
sive differential  settlement. 

Data  presented  above  is  from  the  report  to  the  City 
Engineer,  City  of  Oakland  entitled  "Report  on  Foun- 
dation Conditions  at  Proposed  Development  of  12th

SEISMIC  PROBLEMS  IN  THE  USE  OF  FILLS 
IN  SAN  FRANCISCO  BAY 

By  H.  Bolton  Seed 


INTRODUCTION 

The  probable  behavior  during  earthquakes  of  filled 
areas  overlying  deposits  of  bay  mud  along  the  shore- 
line of  San  Francisco  Bay  has  been  the  subject  of 
much  argument  in  recent  years.  Points  of  view  have 
ranged  from  the  position  that  fills  overlying  bay  mud 
constitute  a  major  hazard  to  life  and  property  to, 
at  the  other  extreme,  claims  that  the  presence  of  the 
bay  mud  is  advantageous  to  the  seismic  behavior  of 
the  fill  and  the  structures  which  it  supports.  In  view 
of  this  wide  range  of  opinions  and  the  fact  that  the 
bay  area  lies  in  a  zone  of  high  seismic  activity,  it  is 
important  to  analyze  the  situation  to  develop  a  clear 
picture  of  the  possible  seismic  hazards  associated  with 
bay  fill  developments. 

SEISMIC  EFFECTS 

The  main  seismic  effects  associated  with  earth- 
quakes are: 

Surface  Faulting  or  Displacement 

Earthquakes  are  caused  by  the  sudden  displacement 
of  the  earth  along  faults  with  a  consequent  release  of 
stored  strain  energy.  In  larger  earthquakes,  the  fault 
slippage  will  often  extend  to  the  ground  surface  where 
it  is  manifested  by  sudden  and  abrupt  relative  ground 
displacements.  These  displacements  may  be  primarily 
horizontal  as  in  the  case  of  the  San  Francisco  earth- 
quake of  1906  where  the  maximum  horizontal  displace- 
ment was  about  20  feet,  or  they  may  be  primarily 
vertical  as  in  the  case  of  the  Hebgen  Lake,  Montana, 
earthquake  of  1959,  for  which  the  vertical  displace- 
ment was  about  20  feet.  They  may  also  produce  a 
combination  of  horizontal  and  vertical  displacements. 

From  an  engineering  point  of  view,  no  structure  can 
be  designed  to  withstand,  without  some  damage,  a 
large  displacement  which  may  occur  along  an  under- 
lying fault.  A  number  of  housing  developments  in 
California  are  located  on  major  faults,  and  damage 
to  houses  and  other  buildings  in  the  event  of  fault 
slippage  in  these  areas  is  inevitable. 

Fortunately,  it  does  not  appear  that  any  important 
active  faults  underlie  the  bay  itself  except  where  the 


Hayward  fault  extends  across  San  Pablo  Bay.  Thus, 
except  in  this  area,  no  major  problems  of  damage  due 
to  surface  faulting  are  likely  to  develop  in  connection 
with  bay  fills. 

Change  in  Elevation  of  Ground 

Associated  with  vertical  fault  slippage  in  a  major 
earthquake  there  is  often  an  overall  change  in  eleva- 
tion of  the  ground  level  (tectonic  movements)  extend- 
ing for  several  hundred  miles  from  the  fault  itself. 
These  movements,  which  may  be  up  or  down  depend- 
ing on  the  direction  of  movement  of  the  fault,  are  so 
gradual  in  form  that  they  are  of  little  significance 
except  along  the  coast  line,  where  the  relative  move- 
ment of  the  land  to  water  level  may  lead  to  flooding 
(in  cases  where  the  land  moves  downwards)  or  dis- 
ruption of  shoreline  facilities  and  operations  (in  cases 
where  the  land  moves  upwards).  In  the  Alaska  earth- 
quake of  1964,  for  example,  the  uplift  and  subsidence 
accompanying  the  fault  movement  affected  an  area 
of  at  least  34,000  square  miles.  East  of  the  fault  zone 
the  land  levels  were  raised  as  much  as  38  feet,  while 
to  the  west  the  general  land  level  subsided  as  much  as 
7.5  feet.  Thus  coastal  towns  such  as  Cordova  were 
raised  about  6  feet  relative  to  mean  sea  level,  while 
Whittier  and  Seward  subsided  several  feet. 

As  noted  in  the  accompanying  report  by  H.  Gold- 
man, recent  historical  displacements  along  the  major 
faults  in  the  bay  area  have  been  predominantly  hori- 
zontal. However,  geologic  evidence  indicates  that 
older  movements  have  involved  significant  vertical 
displacements.  Thus  it  would  seem  prudent  to  con- 
sider the  possibility  of  one  or  two  feet  of  vertical 
displacement  of  the  land  surface  adjacent  to  the  bay 
simply  as  a  result  of  the  regional  ground  movements 
associated  with  major  fault  displacements. 

Ground  Shaking 

The  release  of  built-up  strain  energy  accompanying 
slippage  along  a  fault  leads  to  severe  ground  vibra- 
tions which  in  general  diminish  in  intensity  with  in- 
creasing distance  from  the  fault.  However,  within 
about  15  miles  of  a  major  fault  like  the  San  Andreas, 


[89]

during  a  major  earthquake  ground  vibrations  on  similar 
geologic  formations  are  not  likely  to  vary  appreciably; 
beyond  this  distance  they  will  decrease  progressively, 
but  they  are  still  likely  to  be  felt  as  much  as  100  or 
more  miles  away. 

Apart  from  the  general  decrease  in  vibration  inten- 
sity with  distance  from  the  fault,  local  variations  in 
shaking  intensity  are  likely  to  occur  due  to  variations 
in  soil  conditions.  In  addition,  the  shaking  may  have 
other  detrimental  effects  on  certain  types  of  soils. 
Some  of  these  other  effects  are  discussed  in  the  fol- 
lowing section. 


SOIL  STABILITY  PROBLEMS  CAUSED  BY  EARTHQUAKES 
Settlement  of  Cohesionless  Soils 

It  has  long  been  recognized  that  vibration  is  an 
effective  means  of  compacting  cohesionless  soils,  that 
is,  soils  containing  no  significant  clay  component.  Thus 
it  is  not  surprising  that  the  ground  vibrations  caused 
by  earthquakes  often  lead  to  compaction  of  cohesion- 
less soil  deposits  and  associated  settlement  of  the 
ground  surface. 

A  quantitative  measure  of  ground  settlement  of  this 
type  was  provided  by  the  behavior  of  a  well  casing 
at  Homer  during  the  Alaska  earthquake  (1964).  The 
casing  had  been  installed  to  firm  rock  before  the 
earthquake  and  projected  about  one  foot  above  the 
ground  surface.  Following  the  earthquake  the  casing 
projected  some  3.5  feet  above  the  ground  surface, 
indicating  a  decrease  in  thickness  of  the  soil  layer  of 
about  2.5  feet.  Tectonic  movements  caused  the  under- 
lying rock  surface  to  be  lowered  by  2  feet  and  this, 
together  with  the  2.5  feet  of  settlement  caused  by  soil 
compaction,  resulted  in  a  total  settlement  of  the 
ground  surface  of  4.5  feet. 

A  similar  combination  of  effects  in  the  Portage  area 
of  Alaska  (1964)  led  to  the  town  being  inaccessible 
during  periods  of  high  tide.  Here  the  combination  of 
about  5  feet  settlement  of  the  rock  due  to  tectonic 
movements  together  with  4  to  5  feet  of  settlement  due 
to  compaction  of  the  overlying  soil,  led  to  a  ground 
surface  settlement  of  8  or  9  feet.  As  a  result,  the  high- 
way from  Anchorage  to  Portage,  which  was  con- 
structed on  an  embankment  fill  along  the  coastline, 
was  submerged  during  periods  of  high  tide,  and  the 
township  had  to  move  to  a  new  location. 

Similar  problems  of  flooding  and  inundation  of  land 
due  to  settlement  of  cohesionless  soil  by  compaction 
also  occurred  in  the  Chilean  earthquake  (1960)  and 
the  Niigata,  Japan,  earthquake   (1964). 

Ground  settlements  due  to  compaction  may  lead  to 
differential  settlement  of  engineering  structures— a 
phenomenon  which  is  particularly  well  illustrated  by 
the  performance  of  bridge  abutments.  Often  an  abut- 
ment is  supported  on  firm  materials  or  on  a  pile 
foundation  and  undergoes  relatively  small  settlements 
compared  with  the  backfill  material  for  the  abutment, 
which  rests  directly  on  the  ground  surface  and  settles 
due  to  compaction  of  the  soil  on  which  it  rests.  In  the 
case  of  a  bridge  near  Portage,  Alaska,  the  piers  and 
abutments  were  supported  on  piles,  but  the  abutment 


piles  extended  to  a  greater  depth  than  those  under  the 
piers.  As  a  result  the  piers  settled  more  than  the  abut- 
ment (due  to  the  greater  depth  of  soil  below  them 
compacted  by  the  earthquake)  and  the  bridge  &lt;lecls 
was  left  spanning  across  the  stream  bed,  unsupported 
by  the  piers  on  which  it  had  previously  rested.  Back-; 
fill  settlement  relative  to  the  abutment  left  the  railroad 
tracks  unsupported  behind  the  bridge  abutment. 

Soil  Liquefaction — Level  Ground 

If  loose  or  medium  dense  saturated  cohesionless  ma- 
terials are  subjected  to  earthquake  ground  vibrations' 
the  resulting  tendency  to  compact  must  be  accompa- 
nied by  an  increase  in  water  pressure  in  the  soil  anc 
a  resulting  movement  of  water  from  the  voids.  Watei 
is  thus  caused  to  flow  upwards  to  the  ground  surfac&lt; 
where  it  emerges  in  the  form  of  mud-spouts  or  sane 
boils.  The  development  of  high  water  pressures  ii 
soils  due  to  ground  vibrations  and  the  resulting  up 
ward  flow  of  water  will  often  turn  a  sand  into  ; 
"quick"  or  liquefied  condition  (it  may  be  recallec 
that  quicksand  is  a  condition  induced  by  a  sufficientlj 
large  upward  flow  of  water  through  a  sand). 

Liquefaction  of  saturated  sands  is  a  rather  commoi 
phenomenon  during  earthquakes  but  nowhere  has  i 
been  more  dramatically  illustrated  than  in  the  towi 
of  Niigata,  Japan,  during  the  earthquake  of  June,  1964 
The  epicenter  of  the  earthquake  (magnitude  abou 
7.3)  was  located  some  35  miles  from  Niigata  bu 
nevertheless  the  earthquake  induced  extensive  lique 
faction  of  the  sand  deposits  in  the  low-lying  areas  o 
the  town. 

As  liquefaction  developed  over  extensive  areas,  auto 
mobiles,  structures  and  other  objects  gradually  settler 
into  the  resulting  quicksand,  and  several  light-weigh 
buried  structures  floated  to  the  surface.  A  sewag 
treatment  tank  which  was  originally  buried  with  it 
base  some  15  feet  below  the  ground  surface,  projects 
about  10  feet  above  the  surface  when  the  groun 
motions  subsided. 

Many  structures  settled  more  than  three  feet  and 
the  settlement  was  often  accompanied  by  severe  tilt 
ing.  Undoubtedly  the  most  dramatic  case  of  settlin 
and  tilting  was  that  experienced  by  the  apartmer 
buildings  at  Kawagishi-cho  (figure  1).  One  of  thes! 
buildings  tilted  through  an  angle  of  80°  and  the  occu 
pants  were  able  to  evacuate,  after  the  motion  stoppec 
by  walking  down  the  face  of  the  building.  Neighboi 
ing  buildings  suffered  varying  lesser  degrees  of  tiltinj 
The  airport  building  settled  three  feet  and  extensivj 
liquefaction  occurred  in  the  surrounding  area,  causin 
severe  damage  to  runways  and  other  facilities. 

Similar  effects  to  those  described  above  occurre 
at  Puerto  Montt  during  the  Chilean  earthquake  of  Ma 
1960.  The  southerly  part  of  the  city  is  located  on  kr 
flat  land  adjacent  to  the  waterfront.  Along  the  watei 
front  itself,  structures  are  constructed  on  a  granule 
fill,  placed  in  some  areas  by  dumping  and  in  others  b 
hydraulic  methods.  Both  types  of  fill  liquefied  exter 
sively  during  the  earthquake.  Similar  liquefaction  ( 
sands  and  silts  underlying  level  ground  is  reporte 
to  have  occurred  at  Valdivia  and  other  locations. 


Figure    1.      Tilting  of  apartment  buildings  at  Kawagishi-cho,  Niigata. 


Soil  Liquefaction  in  Sloping  Ground — Flow  Slides 

If  liquefaction  occurs  in  or  under  a  sloping  soil  mass, 
:he  entire  mass,  together  possibly  with  adjacent  lique- 
fed  deposits,  will  flow  or  move  laterally  to  the  un- 
supported side  in  a  phenomenon  termed  a  flow  slide. 
Such  slides  also  develop  in  loose  saturated  cohesion- 
ess  materials  during  earthquakes  and  are  reported  in 
Chile  (1960),  Alaska  (1964),  and  Niigata  (1964). 

Flow  slides  developed  in  loose  fill  along  the  water- 
:ront  at  Puerto  Montt  (described  above)  as  evidenced 
ay  the  lateral  separation  of  about  9  feet  which  oc- 
curred between  two  halves  of  a  building,  one  part  of 
vhich  rested  on  liquefied  soil.  A  similar  phenomenon 
jccurred  at  a  school  building  constructed  near  the 
iver  bank  at  Niigata,  and  lateral  spreading  of  ground 
oward  surface  depressions  was  observed  at  a  number 
&gt;f  locations  in  the  Alaska  earthquake. 

More  extensive  flow  slides  also  occurred  during  the 
Vlaska  earthquake  at  Valdez,  Seward,  Kenai  Lake  and 
'arious  other  locations.  At  Valdez  and  Seward,  al- 
hough  large  parts  of  the  slide  masses  were  under 
vater,  extensive  sections  of  the  waterfront  (about 
■,000  feet  of  coastline  at  Seward)  were  carried  away 
»y  the  flow  slides. 

Probably  the  largest  flow  slides  in  recorded  history 
ccurred  in  Kansu  Province,  China,  during  an  earth- 


quake in  1920.  Again  the  soil  involved  was  a  loose 
loess-type  granular  deposit.  Large  flow  slides  in  this 
material  occurred  over  an  area  100  square  miles  in 
extent.  Cities  were  buried  and  farmsteads  were  carried 
away  to  be  set  down  in  new  locations  once  the  move- 
ments stopped.  In  one  area  a  section  of  a  roadway, 
with  its  border  of  poplar  trees,  was  transported  and 
set  down  one  mile  from  its  original  location.  It  is 
reported  that  some  200,000  people  were  killed  during 
these  enormous  movements. 

However,  flow  slides  may  also  be  induced  on  a 
smaller  scale  by  relatively  small  earthquakes,  as  evi- 
denced by  the  slides  which  occurred  along  the  high- 
way bordering  Lake  Merced  in  San  Francisco  during 
an  earthquake  of  magnitude  5.3  in  1957.  The  highway 
was  constructed  on  several  feet  of  fill  resting  on  a 
saturated  loose  sand  deposit.  Liquefaction  of  the  loose 
sand  resulted  in  sections  of  the  highway  being  carried 
some  distance  into  the  lake,  illustrating  the  large  lateral 
translations  characteristics  of  flow  slides. 

Waterfront  Bulkhead  Failures  Due  to  Backfill  Liquefaction 

Since  liquefaction  develops  most  frequently  in  loose 
saturated  cohesionless  soils,  it  is  not  surprising  that 
many  instances  of  waterfront  bulkhead  failures  during 
earthquakes  have  been  reported  due  to  liquefaction  of 


92

[SR  97 


the  backfill.  Such  bulkheads  usually  consist  of  sheet 
pile  walls  or  reinforced  concrete  walls  which  are 
placed  in  water  along  a  coastline  and  then  backfilled 
to  create  a  dock  or  pier.  Backfill  materials  are  usually 
sand  or  sand  and  gravel.  Since  it  is  difficult  to  com- 
pact the  backfill  below  the  water  level,  it  often  con- 
sists of  a  loose  saturated  sandy  material  which  is 
extremely  vulnerable  to  liquefaction.  The  walls  them- 
selves are  usually  designed  to  withstand  the  relatively 
low  pressures  applied  to  them  by  the  non-liquefied 
sand  backfill.  Thus  if  the  backfill  liquefies  during  an 
earthquake,  the  increase  in  lateral  pressure  accompany- 
ing liquefaction  may  well  cause  the  wall  to  be  pushed 
outwards.  Quay  walls  and  bulkheads  in  dock  areas 
have  often  suffered  major  damage  during  earthquakes 
due  to  these  effects. 

Extensive  failures  of  quay  walls  and  bulkheads  as 
a  result  of  backfill  liquefaction  occurred  at  Puerto 
Montt  (1960)  and  Niigata  (1964).  At  Puerto  Montt, 
during  the  Chilean  earthquake,  the  land  along  the 
coast  flowed  into  the  sea  over  a  length  of  2,000  feet, 
carrying  the  retaining  structures  with  it.  Quay  walls, 
consisting  typically  of  16-foot  reinforced  concrete 
sections  constructed  on  about  35-foot  high  soil-filled 
concrete  caissons,  overturned  completely  over  a  length 
of  about  900  feet;  over  another  section  700  feet  long, 
the  reinforced  concrete  upper  section  overturned  com- 
pletely while  the  lower  caisson  section  tilted  outwards. 
The  fill  behind  the  walls  disappeared  into  the  bay. 
Anchored  sheet  pile  bulkheads  along  the  waterfront 
were  pushed  outwards  up  to  three  feet  over  a  length 
of  about  1,250  feet,  with  resulting  settlement  and  dis- 
tortion of  the  railway  tracks  behind  them. 

Similar  damage  occurred  to  the  sheet  pile  bulkheads 
with  loose  sand  backfills  in  the  harbor  area  of  Niigata. 
Extensive  sections  moved  outwards  under  the  in- 
creased backfill  pressures  developed  by  the  backfills 
during  the  earthquake,  with  resulting  damage  to  struc- 
tures behind  them  due  to  settlement  and  lateral  trans- 
lation of  the  foundations. 

Extensive  failures  of  walls  involved  in  flow  slides 
at  Valdez  and  Seward  in  the  Alaska  earthquake  have 
already  been  described. 

Slides  Caused  by  Liquefaction  of  Thin  Sand  Layers 

Loose  saturated  silts  and  sands  often  occur  as  essen- 
tially horizontal,  thin  seams  or  layers  underlying 
firmer  materials.  In  such  cases  liquefaction  of  the  sand 
induced  by  earthquake  ground  motions  may  cause  an 
overlying  sloping  soil  mass  to  slide  laterally  along  the 
liquefied  layer  at  its  base.  When  this  happens,  a  zone 
of  soil  at  the  back  end  of  the  sliding  mass  sinks  into 
the  vacant  space  formed  as  the  mass  translates,  result- 
ing in  a  depressed  zone  known  as  a  graben.  During 
motions  of  this  type,  structures  on  the  main  slide  mass 
are  translated  laterally,  often  without  significant  dam- 
age, but  buildings  in  the  graben  area  are  subjected 
to  such  large  differential  settlements  that  they  are 
often  completely  destroyed.  Furthermore,  buildings 
near  the  toe  of  the  slide  area,  where  the  soil  pushes 
outwards,  may  be  heaved  upwards  or  pushed  over 
by  the  lateral  thrust. 


Several  slides  of  this  type  occurred  in  Anchorage 
during  the  Alaska  earthquake  of  1964.  The  L-Street 
slide  area  involved  a  soil  mass  about  4,000  feet  in 
length  parallel  to  the  bluffs  and  extending  back  from 
the  toe  as  much  as  1,200  feet.  The  graben,  which 
formed  behind  the  slide  mass  varied  in  width  from 
100  to  250  feet  and  in  depth  from  about  7  to  10  feet. 

Similar  grabens,  causing  extensive  destruction  of 
buildings,  developed  in  the  4th  Avenue  and  Govern- 
ment Hill  slide  areas. 

Landslides  in  Clay  Soils 

Major  slide  movements  during  earthquakes  have  also 
occurred  in  clay  deposits.  There  is  no  evidence  that 
clays  liquefy  during  earthquakes  in  the  sense  that  an 
extensive  zone  of  clay  soil  is  converted  into  a  fluid 
condition.  However,  some  types  of  clay  may  lose  a 
proportion  of  their  strength  and  the  additional  forces 
induced  by  an  earthquake  may  cause  slope  failures 
with  resulting  slumping.  In  addition,  clay  deposits 
often  contain  sand  lenses  and  liquefaction  of  these 
lenses  may  lead  to  significant  landslide  development. 

One  of  the  largest  slides  in  a  clay  deposit  was  that 
which  occurred  along  the  coastline  of  the  Turnagain 
Heights  area  of  Anchorage  during  the  Alaska  earth- 
quake of  1964.  The  coastline  in  this  area  was  marked 
by  bluffs  some  70  feet  high  and  sloping  at  about  1 1/2  :J 
down  to  the  bay.  The  slide  extended  about  8,500  feet 
from  east  to  west  along  the  bluff  line  and  retrogressed 
inland  an  average  distance  of  about  900  feet.  The  total 
area  involved  in  the  slide  was  thus  about  130  acres. 

Within  the  slide  area  the  original  ground  surface 
was  completely  devastated  by  displacements  which 
broke  up  the  ground  into  a  complex  system  of  ridges 
and  depressions.  In  the  depressed  areas  between  the 
ridges  the  ground  dropped  an  average  of  35  feet  dur- 
ing the  sliding.  The  east  end  of  the  slide  area  had  been 
developed  for  residential  purposes  and  about  75  houses 
in  this  section  of  the  area  were  destroyed.  A  study 
conducted  by  the  Engineering  Geology  Evaluation 
Group  in  Anchorage  revealed  that  some  of  the  houses 
moved  laterally  as  much  as  500  to  600  feet  during  the 
sliding. 

It  appears  that  liquefaction  of  sand  lenses  within  the 
clay  played  a  significant  role  in  the  development  of 
the  Turnagain  Heights  slide. 

Three  somewhat  similar  slides  occurred  on  the  San 
Pedro  River  near  Lake  Rinehue  during  the  Chilean 
earthquake  of  1960.  The  largest  of  these  involved  about 
30  million  cubic  yards  of  material  which  moved  verti- 
cally about  60  feet  and  laterally  about  1,000  feet  dur- 
ing the  sliding.  The  other  two  slides  involved  about 
6  million  and  2  million  cubic  yards  of  soil  respectively. 
The  slides  blocked  the  course  of  the  river  and  raised 
the  water  level  in  the  lake  by  80  feet,  thereby  endan- 
gering the  city  of  Valdivia  some  35  miles  to  the  west. 
It  is  of  interest  to  note  that  a  similar  effect  occurred 
when  an  adjacent  area  slid  into  the  river  during  an 
earthquake  in  1575. 

Sloping  Fills  on  Firm  Foundations 
The  effect  of  earthquakes  on  banks  of  well-com- 
pacted fill  constructed  on  firm  foundations  in  which 


1969]

no  significant  increases  in  pore-water  pressure  develop 
during  the  earthquake,  is  characteristically  a  slumping 
of  the  fill  resulting  in  settlements  varying  from  a  frac- 
tion of  an  inch  to  several  feet,  depending  on  the  slope. 
However,  such  slumping  is  negligible  in  gently  slop- 
ing sections. 

Sloping  Fills  on  Weak  Foundations 

In  contrast  to  the  behavior  of  sloping  fills  on  firm 
foundations,  many  cases  have  been  reported  in  which 
embankments  on  weak  foundations  have  either  failed 
completely  or  slumped  severely  with  associated  longi- 
tudinal cracking. 

An  excellent  example  is  provided  by  the  behavior 
of  an  embankment  section  of  the  north-south  highway 
between  Puerto  Varas  and  Puerto  Montt,  Chile.  A 
four-foot  high  fill,  about  1,500  feet  long,  was  con- 
structed where  the  highway  passed  over  a  swampy 
area  of  ground  and  surfaced  with  an  eight-inch  thick 
concrete  pavement.  During  the  earthquake  of  1960  the 
embankment  collapsed  completely,  and  the  concrete 
pavement  slabs  were  deposited  at  the  level  of  the 
swamp.  The  highway  was  undamaged  before  entering 
and  after  leaving  the  swamp  area. 

Similar  behavior  was  observed  in  a  dike,  built  to  a 
height  of  seven  feet  along  the  bank  of  a  canal  in  north- 
ern Mexico,  which  sank  completely  into  the  under- 
lying soft  foundation  soil,  and  the  complete  collapse 
of  the  side  fill  of  a  highway  bridge  approach  ramp 
during  the  El  Centro  earthquake  of  1940. 

Such  failures  seem  to  be  characterized  by  lateral 
spreading  of  the  soil  at  the  base  of  the  fill  underlying 
Ifhe  slopes.  Where  movement  due  to  spreading  is  less 
severe,  the  resulting  effect  is  usually  severe  longitu- 
dinal cracking  of  the  fill  rather  than  a  complete  failure. 
i.This  type  of  behavior  developed  along  many  sections 
of  highway  embankments  in  the  Alaska  and  Niigata 
earthquakes  of  1964. 

Slumping  and  settlement  of  embankments  in  the  San 
i  [Francisco  Bay  area  during  the  1906  earthquake  were 
iilso  described  by  the  Committee  on  the  Effect  of  the 
Earthquake  on  Railroad  Structures  as  follows: 

"Embankments  across  marshes  or  with  soft  strata 
jnderlying  them  settled  more  or  less.  In  some  cases 
:he  settlement  was  vertical;  in  other  cases  there  was 
considerable  horizontal  with  the  vertical  movement. 
.  .  At  one  point  on  the  marsh  between  Benicia  and 
5uisun,  on  the  Southern  Pacific,  the  settlement  was 
11  feet;  at  another  point  5  feet.  These  were  nearly 
.ertical.  .  .  .  On  the  North  Shore,  about  2  miles  north 
)f  Point  Reyes,  the  road  originally  had  been  con- 
structed with  pile  trestles  across  several  arms  of  To- 
riales  Bay;  these  trestles  had  been  filled  about  15  years 
igo,  the  roadbed  being  about  8  feet  above  ordinary 
ligh  tide.  Two  of  these  embankments,  2,200  feet  and 
&gt;00  feet  long,  respectively,  sank  until  the  water  at 
ligh  tide  washed  over  the  rails.  .  .  .  Settlements  of 
his  character,  and  of  more  or  less  severity,  were  com- 
non  on  all  railroads  operating  about  the  Bay  of  San 
Francisco  and  its  tributaries." 

While  some  of  these  settlements  were  undoubtedly 
lue  to  compaction  of  loose  fill  material,  it  would  ap- 
)ear  that  displacement  of  the  underlying  soft  deposits 


probably   contributed   to   the   overall   movements  in 
some  cases. 

One  of  the  most  dramatic  examples  of  the  failure 
of  an  entire  fill  resulting  from  loss  of  strength  of  the 
foundation  soil  during  an  earthquake  is  the  failure  of 
the  Sheffield  Dam  during  an  earthquake  near  Santa 
Barbara  in  1926.  During  the  earthquake  observers  re- 
port that  a  section  of  the  dam,  about  300  feet  long, 
slid  downstream  resulting  in  a  complete  loss  of  water 
from  the  reservoir. 

Retaining  Walls  and  Bridge  Abutments 

The  tendency  for  earth  fill  slopes  to  slide  downhill 
during  earthquakes  necessarily  results  in  increased  pres- 
sures on  retaining  walls.  Such  pressures  often  result 
in  wall  displacements. 

Similar  displacements  occur  in  bridge  abutments, 
which  serve  the  dual  purpose  of  supporting  the  bridge 
deck  and  retaining  the  approach  fill.  Inward  move- 
ments of  bridge  abutments  during  earthquakes  causing 
a  distortion  of  the  bridge  structure  have  often  been 
reported. 

INFLUENCE  OF  GROUND  SHAKING  ON  BAY  FILLS 
AND  THEIR  FOUNDATIONS 

The  preceding  section  described  the  effects  that 
earthquake  ground  shaking  may  have  on  soils.  It 
should  not  be  construed  from  this  that  such  effects 
will  necessarily  develop  during  earthquakes;  rather  it 
is  the  responsibility  of  the  engineer  to  minimize  the 
possibility  of  these  effects  developing,  and  recognition 
of  the  types  of  problems  involved  is  an  important  first 
step  in  this  direction.  Engineering  solutions  can  usu- 
ally be  devised  to  reduce  the  hazards  from  all  types 
of  soil  instability  problems  to  acceptable  proportions, 
if  the  hazard  is  recognized  at  a  sufficiently  early  stage. 
For  example,  the  problem  of  settlement  of  sands  dur- 
ing earthquakes  can  be  avoided  by  compacting  the 
sand  to  a  sufficiently  dense  condition  during  construc- 
tion, the  possibility  of  sliding  in  earth  banks  can  often 
be  minimized  by  flattening  slopes,  or  the  possibility 
of  liquefaction  of  fills  can  be  eliminated  either  by  an 
appropriate  choice  of  construction  materials  or  by 
adequate  compaction. 

Thus  the  possible  effects  of  earthquakes  on  soils  are 
determined  in  large  measure  by  the  configuration  of 
the  ground  surface  and  the  nature  of  the  soils  involved. 
It  follows  that  the  effects  of  earthquakes  on  bay  fills 
will  be  largely  determined  by  (1)  the  nature  of  the 
foundation  materials  on  which  the  fills  are  placed  and 
(2)  the  nature  and  configuration  of  the  fills  them- 
selves. Let  us  look  now  at  the  nature  of  these  ma- 
terials as  they  are  likely  to  exist  in  the  bay  area. 

Foundation  Soils 

No  matter  how  good  a  fill  may  be,  shear  failure 
and  lateral  displacement  of  the  foundation  soils  on 
which  it  rests  will  inevitably  lead  to  instability  prob- 
lems. Thus,  in  the  design  of  fills  careful  considera- 
tion must  always  be  given  to  the  foundation  soils. 
Fills  placed  along  the  shoreline  of  the  bay  are  likely 
to  be  supported  directly  on  either  (1)  a  layer  of  San

Francisco  Bay  mud  or  (2)  deposits  of  sand  (see  report 
by  H.  Goldman).  The  nature  of  these  deposits  and 
the  possible  effects  of  earthquake  ground  motions  on 
them  may  be  summarized  as  follows: 

San  Francisco  Bay  Mud 

San  Francisco  Bay  mud  is  a  soft,  slightly  organic 
silty  clay  containing  occasional  thin  seams  or  lenses 
of  silt  and  sand.  Its  high  water  content  and  low  pre- 
consolidation  pressure  cause  it  to  undergo  substantial 
long  term  settlement  under  sustained  loads  and  its  low 
shear  strength  may  lead  to  plastic  flow  in  zones  of 
substantial  shear  stress,  such  as  occur  at  the  edges  of 
steep  fill  slopes.  The  problems  associated  with  these 
characteristics  have  been  discussed  by  Lee  and 
Praszker. 

Investigations  of  the  behavior  of  the  clay  under 
seismic  loading  conditions  indicate  that: 

a.  Under  level  ground  conditions,  there  is  no  evi- 
dence to  indicate  that  the  clay  portion  of  the  deposit 
would  settle  or  liquefy  during  an  earthquake. 

b.  The  sand  seams  in  the  clay  may  liquefy  during 
strong  ground  motions,  but  this  is  unlikely  to  have 
any  serious  effects  unless  the  liquefied  layer  underlies 
or  is  immediately  adjacent  to  a  sloping  surface  and  is 
located  at  a  depth  permitting  sliding  to  occur.  Other- 
wise the  only  effect  would  be  a  very  small  settlement 
as  the  pore  "pressures  in  the  liquefied  seams  dissipated 
after  the  earthquake. 

c.  Slopes  and  adjacent  land  composed  of  or  under- 
lain by  the  clay  may  slide  during  an  earthquake  due 
to  the  additional  forces  developed  in  them  by  the 
earthquake,  unless  they  are  of  sufficiently  conservative 
design. 

d.  The  deformable  nature  of  San  Francisco  Bay  mud 
will  cause  any  deposit  containing  a  substantial  thick- 
ness of  the  clay  to  vibrate  with  a  relatively  low  fre- 
quency of  vibration.  As  a  result,  ground  surface  mo- 
tions would  have  lower  frequencies  than  those  on 
adjacent  areas  not  underlain  by  bay  mud  deposits.  The 
influence  of  this  effect  will  be  discussed  in  a  later 
section  of  this  report. 

Sand  Deposits 

Sand  deposits  in  the  bay  are  likely  to  be  loose  to 
medium  dense  and  thus  under  earthquake  loading  con- 
ditions they  are  potentially  vulnerable  to: 

a.  Settlement  due  to  soil  compaction. 

b.  Liquefaction  with  resulting  settlements  of  over- 
lying materials  and  structures  such  as  occurred  at 
Niigata,  Japan  (1964). 

c.  Liquefaction  and  resulting  flow  slides  such  as 
occurred  at  Valdez  and  Seward  during  the  Alaska 
earthquake  of  1964. 

The  extent  to  which  these  effects  might  develop 
will  depend  on  the  in-place  density  of  the  deposit, 
the  geometry  of  each  particular  case,  and  the  intensity 
and  duration  of  the  earthquake.  However,  the  possi- 
bility of  these  effects  should  be  considered  in  cases 
where  fills  might  be  placed  on  sand  deposits. 


Fill  Materials 

The  main  types  of  fill  materials  likely  to  be  used 
in  the  bay  area  may  be  separated  into  three  main 
classes  as  follows: 

Uncompacted  Dumped  Fill  of  All  Types  of  Soil 

Uncompacted  dumped  fills  are  naturally  loose  and 
form  poor  foundations  for  almost  all  types  of  struc- 
tures. With  time,  however,  they  may  densify  suffi- 
cientlv  to  support  houses  or  other  lightweight  build- 1 
ings.  Under  the  influence  of  earthquake-induced  vibra- 
tions, these  materials: 

a.  Are  likely  to  settle  substantially,  leading  to  appre- 
ciable differential  settlements  of  buildings  supported 
on  them. 

b.  May  liquefy  if  the  fill  is  saturated  and  sandy  m 

nature. 

c.  May  undergo  some  degree  of  lateral  movement 
due  to  differential  movements  within  the  fill. 

d.  May  develop  slides  or  slumping  in  sloping  bound- 
aries, especially  where  the  fill  is  saturated. 

The  above  effects  are  likely  to  be  far  more  dele- 
terious in  their  effects  on  structures  than  are  any  un- 
desirable modifications  of  the  ground  motions,  due  to 
the  nature  of  the  fill  itself. 

This  type  of  behavior  is  best  illustrated  by  the  be- 
havior of  old  bay  fills  in  the  1906  San  Francisco  earth- 
quake. It  is  apparent  from  the  accompanying  report 
by  Mr.  Steinbrugge  that  these  fills  were  loosely 
dumped  and  their  behavior  is  described  by  H.  O 
Wood  in  the  Report  of  the  State  Earthquake  Investi- 
gation Commission  as  follows: 

"About  the  Ferry  Building,  at  the  foot  of  Market  Street,  is 
a  district  of  'made'  land  in  which  high  intensity  was  mani- 
fested ...  In  spots  the  streets  sank  bodily  as  much  as  2 
feet,  probably  more.  Accompanying  this  depression,  concrete 
basement  floors  were  broken  and  arched,  as  if  to  compensate 
for  it.  The  surface  of  the  ground  was  deformed  into  waves 
and  small  open  fissures  were  formed,  especially  close  to 
the  wharves.  Buildings  on  the  water  side,  along  East  Street, 
generally  slumped  seaward  as  much  as  2  feet.  The  damage 
was  greatest  close  to  the  water's  edge,  growing  less  as  the 
solid  land  was  approached  ...  The  shaking  caused  the 
materials  used  in  filling  to  settle  together  and  occupy  less 
space  so  that  the  surface  over  the  whole  area  was  lowered 
by  amounts  varying  from  a  few  inches  to  3  feet  or  more. 
This  is  clearly  seen  in  the  change  of  street  levels  along  the 
margin  of  the  solid  ground,  where  the  car  rails  are  bent 
downwards  in  little  monoclines.  Occasionally  a  structure  with 
a  relatively  good  foundation  remains  at  its  former  level, 
with   the   whole    neighborhood    depressed    about   it." 

Some  indication  that  the  intensity  of  shaking  in  th. 
filled  areas  was  not  in  itself  responsible  for  the  ex 
tensive  damage  which  developed  is  provided  by  th 
statement: 

"Buildings  erected  upon  good  foundations  withstood  the 
ordeal  well,  even  when  the  streets  around  them  were  de- 
pressed and  fissured." 

Thus  it  would  seem  that  buildings  which  did  no 
suffer  differential  settlement  or  lateral  displacemen 
were  able  to  withstand  the  shaking  which  develop© 
in  the  filled  areas  approximately  as  well  as  simila 
buildings  in  non-filled  areas.  Since  the  foundations  o 
a  building  underlain  by  clay  soils  have  virtually  I 
influence  on  the  intensity  of  shaking  at  a  building  site

t  would  thus  appear  that  the  intensity  of  shaking  in 
he  filled  areas  was  not  enormously  different  from  that 
n  the  non-filled  areas. 

,  It  is  important  to  note  that  uncompacted  dumped 
ills  bear  little  resemblance  to  modern,  well-compacted, 
oiled  earth  fills  and  that  the  behavior  of  the  fills  in 
he  1906  earthquake  cannot  therefore  serve  as  a  guide 
jo  the  behavior  of  well-compacted  fills  in  future 
arthquakes. 

lydraulic  Sand  Fills 

Hydraulic  sand  fills  have  been  used  extensively  in 
be  Bay  Area.  If  the  hydraulically  deposited  soil  is  not 
ubsequently  compacted,  it  is  often  in  a  loose  to 
hedium  dense  condition  and  thus  during  earthquakes 
;  potentially  subject  to: 

a.  Some  degree  of  settlement  induced  by  the  ground 
ibrations;  however  the  settlement  will  be  appreciably 
ss  than  that  of  loosely  dumped  fills. 

b.  Possible  liquefaction  depending  on  the  density 
:hieved  during  placement,  the  depth  of  the  water 
:ble  and  the  intensity  of  the  ground  motions. 

c.  Flow  slides  if  the  sand  should  liquefy  adjacent  to 
^supported  sloping  boundaries  at  the  edges  of  the  fill. 

Extensive  liquefaction  developed  in  hydraulic  sand 
ils  at  Puerto  Montt  during  the  Chilean  earthquake  of 

&gt;60,  indicating  the  potential  dangers  associated  with 

is  type  of  material.  On  the  other  hand,  the  experi- 
uces  at  Niigata,  Japan,  in  the  earthquake  of  1964  show 
inclusively  that  loose  to  medium  dense  sands  will  not 
i:cessarily  liquefy,  that  small  changes  in  depth  of 
•ater  table  and  severity  of  shaking  can  have  significant 
(fects  on  liquefaction  potential,  and  that  a  careful 
jpraisal  of  the  significant  details  involved  in  each 
suation  is  required  before  an  evaluation  of  the  pos- 
»le  dangers  of  liquefaction  developing  can  be  made. 

Thus  while  hydraulic  sand  fills  are  potentially  vul- 
irable  to  settlement,  liquefaction  and  flow  slides,  it 
^^uld  be  possible,  under  favorable  conditions  of  mate- 
1 1  characteristics,  soil  profile,  and  water  table  eleva- 
t&gt;n,  to  utilize  these  materials  for  bay  fills  without 
ctrimental  consequences.  It  cannot  be  stressed  too 
fehly,  however,  that  the  best  possible  appraisal  of 
t;se  possibilities  should  be  made  whenever  hvdraulic 
f  s  are  utilized. 

V;ll  Compacted  Fills  of  Select  Material 

During  the  past  twenty  years  significant  progress 
K  been  made  in  the  development  of  earth  moving  and 
cnpacting  equipment  and  in  the  development  of  a 
b  ter  understanding  and  appreciation  of  the  character- 
p  cs  of  compacted  soils.  Thus  most  fills  constructed 
"this  period  under  engineering  supervision  have  been 
cnposed  of  materials  suitable  for  compaction  to  a 
dise,  firm  condition  and  appropriate  measures  have 
Dm  taken  to  ensure  that  they  have  been  placed  in 
S':h  condition  in  the  field. 

&gt;oil  fills  placed  and  compacted  in  this  way  are  much 
finder  materials  than  many  natural  deposits  and  apart 
b'm  possible  slope  stability  problems  when  the  fill  is 
iurated,  they  present  no  serious  hazards  with  regard 
tttheir  behavior  during  earthquakes.  Well-compacted 


select  fill  materials  are  not  likely  themselves  to  settle 
appreciably,  undergo  liquefaction,  or,  if  slopes  are  con- 
servatively designed,  be  involved  in  landslides.  How- 
ever, they  will  of  course  be  affected  if  these  phenom- 
ena should  develop  in  the  underlying  foundation  soils. 
Thus  if  well-compacted  fills  are  placed  with  con- 
servative side  slopes  on  firm  foundation  materials,  they 
should  present  no  special  hazards,  other  than  ground 
shaking,  during  earthquakes.  Some  evidence  of  this  is 
provided  in  Mr.  Steinbrugge's  report  of  the  behavior 
of  fills  in  the  Westlake  Palisades  Tract  during  the  San 
Francisco  earthquake  of  March  22,  1957: 

"These  fills  were  not  over  bay  muds  or  other  compressible 
bay  soils,  but  certainly  their  performance  shows  that  man- 
made  fills,  per  se,  can  be  quite  satisfactory  in  moderate 
earthquakes.  In  contrast,  damage  at  the  San  Francisco  Inter- 
national Airport  about  10  miles  southeast  of  the  epicenter 
was  attributed  to  both  differential  settlements  and  horizontal 
vibratory  forces." 

Although  the  1957  San  Francisco  earthquake  was  not 
nearly  so  strong  as  the  1906  shock,  the  performance 
of  the  fills  is  not  indicative  of  any  major  cause  for 
concern. 

It  should  perhaps  be  noted  that  even  well-compacted 
fills  on  firm  foundations  may,  if  they  are  deep,  undergo 
settlements  of  several  inches  during  a  major  earth- 
quake. However,  many  natural  soils  would  probably 
behave  in  a  similar  manner. 

During  earthquakes  the  main  dangers  with  well- 
compacted  fills  are  likely  to  be  slope  instability  at  the 
edges  of  the  fills,  due  either  to  shear  displacements  in 
saturated  fill  materials  or  in  foundation  soils,  and  fail- 
ure to  adequately  design  structures  for  the  nature  of 
ground  surface  shaking  that  may  develop.  This  would 
indicate  a  need  for  special  studies  and  considerable 
conservatism  in  the  selection  of  slopes  and  a  careful 
consideration  of  the  nature  of  ground  surface  motions 
to  be  expected  in  filled  areas  overlying  bay  deposits. 
This  latter  question  will  be  discussed  in  some  detail  in 
the  following  section  of  this  report. 


NATURE  OF  GROUND  MOTIONS  FOR  WELL- 
COMPACTED  FILLS  PLACED  ON  BAY  MUD 
Frequency  of  Ground  Vibrations 

The  character  of  the  shaking  developed  at  the 
ground  surface  during  an  earthquake  is  influenced 
to  a  considerable  degree  by  the  nature  of  the  entire 
soil  deposit  overlying  relatively  sound  basement  ma- 
terials at  the  site.  Both  field  instrumental  data  and 
scientific  analyses  show  that  in  general  the  softer  the 
nature  of  the  underlying  soil  deposits,  the  lower  will 
be  the  predominant  frequency  of  vibration  of  the 
ground  surface  motions. 

The  effect  of  the  ground  motions  on  buildings  and 
structures  depends  not  only  on  the  characteristics  of 
the  ground  motion  but  also  on  the  vibration  charac- 
teristics of  the  buildings  themselves.  The  vibration 
characteristics  of  a  building  are  conveniently  expressed 
in  terms  of  its  fundamental  frequency  of  vibration — 
that  is  the  predominant  frequency  with  which  the 
building  would  vibrate  if  it  were  pulled  sideways  at 
the  top  and  then  suddenly  released,  without  simul-

taneously  being  subjected  to  any  other  source  of  vi- 
bration. Thus,  for  example,  a  stiff  single-story  build- 
ing would  typically  have  a  fundamental  frequency  of 
vibration  of  about  20  cycles  per  second,  a  10-story 
building  might  have  a  fundamental  frequency  of  about 
1  cycle  per  second  and  a  40-story  building  might  have 
a  fundamental  frequency  of  about  0.25  cycle  per 
second. 

If  a  building  is  subjected  at  its  base  to  a  series  of 
vibrations  having  the  same  frequency  as  the  natural 
frequency  of  the  building,  then  large  amplitude  mo- 
tions and  large  forces  develop  in  the  building.  On 
the  other  hand  if  the  same  building  is  subjected  to 
base  vibrations  having  a  frequency  very  different  from 
the  natural  frequency  of  the  building,  comparatively 
small  effects  will  be  induced  in  the  building. 

Thus  in  order  to  minimize  the  effects  of  ground 
shaking  on  buildings,  it  is  desirable  to  develop  as  much 
differentiation  as  possible  between  the  fundamental 
frequency  of  the  building  and  the  predominant  fre- 
quency of  the  ground  motions.  For  buildings  con- 
structed on  fills  over  bay  mud,  for  which  the  pre- 
dominant frequency  of  ground  surface  motions  will 
be  relatively  low,  vibration  effects  are  likely  to  be 
smallest  for  buildings  with  high  frequency  character- 
istics, such  as  single-story  structures,  and  largest  for 
buildings  with  low  frequency  characteristics  such  as 
multi-story  structures. 

This  does  not  mean  that  multi-story  buildings  can- 
not be  constructed  at  sites  underlain  by  soft  soils  such 
as  bay  mud.  However,  it  must  be  recognized  that 
such  structures  will  be  subjected  to  more  severe  shak- 
ing than  smaller  structures  and  they  must  be  designed 
accordingly  because  of  the  increased  seismic  risk. 

Mr.  Steinbrugge  describes  an  excellent  illustration 
of  the  above  effects  in  Mexico  City,  much  of  which 
is  underlain  by  a  deep  bed  of  clay: 

"A  classic  example  of  selective  damage  to  tall  buildings 
(i.e.,  long  period  structures)  compared  to  rigid  one-  and  two- 
story  buildings  occurred  in  the  July  20,  1957,  Mexican  earth- 
quake. The  earthquake  was  distant  with  its  epicenter  re- 
ported from  170  to  220  miles  from  Mexico  City.  Damage 
was  pronounced  to  many  of  the  tall  reinforced  concrete  and 
steel-frame  buildings  in  downtown  Mexico  City,  and  several 
collapsed.  Small  one-  and  two-story  collapse-hazard  buildings 
performed  well." 

Similar  effects  were  also  apparent  in  Anchorage  dur- 
ing the  Alaska  earthquake  of  March  1964.  This  city 
is  also  underlain  by  a  deep  bed  of  soft  clay  which 
would  result  in  long  period  (low  frequency)  ground 
surface  motions.  In  areas  where  building  damage  was 
not  related  to  landsliding,  major  damage  occurred  in 
multi-story  buildings  with  adjacent  single-story  struc- 
tures being  virtually  undamaged. 

Thus  there  is  much  evidence  to  support  Mr.  Stein- 
brugge's  conclusion  : 

"In  a  general  sense,  the  seismic  risk  to  buildings  on  Bay 
fills  from  ground  motions  ...  is  least  for  one-story  light 
mass   structures   of  no   more  than    moderate  floor   areas." 

Amplitude  of  Ground  Vibrations 
While  there  is  reasonably  general  agreement  on  the 
effect  of  soft  soil  deposits  on  the  predominant  fre- 
quency of  the  ground  surface  vibrations,  there  is  con- 


siderable disagreement  on  the  effects  of  such  soils  o 
the  amplitude  or  intensity  of  these  vibrations. 

There  is  a  widespread  tendency  to  believe  that  a 
earthquake  ground  motions  are  amplified  and  are  man 
times  larger  for  areas  underlain  by  soft  alluvial  d&lt; 
posits  than  for  adjacent  areas  underlain  by  rock;  fii 
thermore,  that  the  severity  of  the  ground  motic 
tends  to  increase  with  increasing  depth  of  alluvi 
deposits.  However,  such  concepts  are  probably  a 
oversimplification  of  the  actual  conditions,  and  thi 
merit  close  scrutiny  before  being  used  as  the  basis  f( 
conclusions. 

Evidence  supporting  the  argument  that  alluvial  d, 
posits  cause  considerable  amplification  of  ground  m&lt; 
tions  comes  primarily  from  two  sources: 

1.  There  is  much  instrumental  evidence  from  a&gt; 
tual  recordings  that  ground  accelerations  recorded  c 
alluvial  deposits  are  many  times  larger  than  those  &lt; 
adjacent  rock  areas.  However,  almost  all  of  these  re 
ords  pertain  to  extremely  small  earthquakes  and  whi 
the  result  is  undoubtedly  true  for  micro-tremors,  the 
is  little  justification  for  extrapolating  the  results 
earthquakes  (possibly  releasing  100,000  times  mo 
energy)  inducing  strong  ground  motions.  Durii 
strong  ground  motions,  the  laws  controlling  soil  b 
havior  are  quite  different  from  those  applicable  durii 
weak  ground  motions  and  a  great  deal  more  eneq 
is  absorbed  by  the  soil.  Thus,  any  amplification 
ground  motions  during  large  earthquakes  would  ! 
expected  to  be  very  much  smaller  than  those  observ. 
during  very  small  shocks. 

It  is  worthy  of  note  that  there  are  no  records  fro 
zones  of  strong  ground  shaking  in  major  earthqual&lt; 
to  show  the  extent  to  which  ground  motions  wei 
amplified  on  soft  soil  deposits.  This  type  of  inform 
tion  for  major  earthquakes  is  badly  needed  for  scie; 
tific,  engineering,  and  planning  purposes. 

Analyses  of  soil  response  in  Anchorage  during  t 
recent  Alaska  earthquake  indicate  that  surface  mono 
may  have  been  only  about  30  percent  greater  th 
those  in  the  base  rock,  and  similar  studies  for  the  20 
foot  layer  of  sand  at  Niigata  indicate  an  amphficatKi 
of  about  50  percent. 

2.  A  considerable  amount  of  evidence  shows  th1 
damage  to  buildings  located  on  loose  or  soft  soils 
considerably  greater  than  that  to  adjacent  buildings 
firmer  materials  and  there  is  a  tendency  to  attnbi 
this  to  more  violent  shaking  in  the  loose  or  soft  s 
areas. 

In  his  report  on  the  relationship  between  grou 
conditions  and  damage  in  the  1906  San  Francis 
earthquake,  Wood  concluded: 

"This  investigation  has  clearly  demonstrated  that  the 
amount  of  damage  produced  by  the  earthquake  of  April  18 
in  different  parts  of  the  city  and  county  of  San  Francisco 
depended  chiefly  upon  the  geological  character  of  the 
ground.  Where  the  surface  was  solid  rock  the  shock  produced 
little  damage;  whereas  upon  made  land  great  violence  was 
manifested." 

Wood  also  prepared  a  map  showing  variations 
intensity  (see  accompanying  report  by  K.  Ste 
brugge),  which  correlate  broadly  with  geological  cc 
ditions.  However  as  noted  previously,  a  careful  ra 
ing  of  Wood's  report  indicates  that  buildings  in  fn

areas  which  did  not  themselves  settle  were  no  more 
damaged  than  buildings  in  firm  soil  areas  and  thus  it 
appears  that  the  shaking  intensity  was  not  significantly 
more  severe  in  the  loose  fill  areas  than  in  firm  soil  areas. 
In  the  light  of  this  fact,  the  intensity  referred  to  by 
Wood  is  presumably  a  damage  intensity  and  other 
factors,  such  as  ground  settlement,  and  lateral  displace- 
ment are  likely  to  play  as  important  a  part  in  this 
categorization  as  shaking  intensity. 

Similar  effects  have  been  manifested  in  other  earth- 
quakes and  while  it  is  true  that  loose  and  soft  soils 
have  led  to  much  greater  damage  levels  than  have  firm 
soils  and  rocks,  the  reasons  for  this  have  not  necessarily 
been  simply  the  greater  severity  of  shaking  but  also 
greater  susceptibility  of  soft  and  loose  soils  to  land- 
;liding,  lateral  displacements,  and  differential  settle- 
ments. 

This  is  not  to  say  that  some  amplification  of  ground 
Vibrations  has  not  occurred — but  there  is  no  reason  to 
Relieve  that  it  has  been  particularly  large  or  anywhere 

lear  the   order   of  magnitude   observed   for  micro- 

remors  and  very  small  earthquakes. 
I  A  final  factor  which  must  be  considered  in  assessing 

he  influence  of  soil  conditions  on  the  intensity  of 
/round  shaking  is  the  recent  availability  of  analytical 
,  &gt;rocedures  for  evaluating  this  factor.  While  there  have 

teen  limited  opportunities  to  check  the  validity  of 
I  hese  analyses,  the  results  obtained  have  been  in  good 
I  .greement  with  field  conditions  in  the  few  cases  avail- 

ble  for  corroboration  studies.  Application  of  these 
i  echniques  to  typical  fill  over  bay  mud  conditions  indi- 
cates, for  high  intensity  shaking,  much  smaller  ampli- 
i  .cations  of  adjacent  rock  motions  that  have  previously 
.een  anticipated.  Furthermore,  the  analyses  indicate 
i  ride  variations  in  intensity  of  surface  shaking  in  the 

ime  general  area,  depending  on  the  depth  and  char- 

cter  of  the  soils  (bay  mud  or  sand)  underlying  the 

I'  In  the  light  of  all  available  information,  it  would 

thus  appear  that  while  some  degree  of  amplification 

f  ground  motions  for  some  areas  underlain  by  soil 

eposits  can  certainly  be  anticipated,  the  amount  will 

epend  greatly  on  the  depth  and  character  of  the  de- 

osit  and  the  intensity  of  the  ground  motions  them- 

:lves.  For  fills  on  deep  layers  of  clay  in  the  bay  area, 

.  je  amplification  of  adjacent  rock  motions  is  not  likely 

e »  exceed  acceptable  design  limits  for  strong  motions 

duced  by  major  earthquakes.  As  a  matter  of  fact, 

reater  amplification  of  soil  over  adjacent  rock  mo- 

pns  might  well  be  expected  for  many  other  natural 

•il  deposits  in  the  bay  area. 

Probably  the  soil  conditions  most  analogous,  from 
:  ground  shaking  point  of  view,  to  well-compacted 
bis  overlying  deep  bay  mud  deposits,  and  for  which 
iismic  experience  is  available,  are  the  soil  deposits  in 
-nchorage,  Alaska.  The  soil  profile  in  the  Turnagain 
i eights  area,  well  behind  the  coastal  bluffs,  is  shown 
i  figure  2.  For  purposes  of  comparison,  the  condi- 
Ons  at  Treasure  Island  in  San  Francisco  Bay  are  also 
Hown  in  figure  2. 
During  the  past  25  years,  Anchorage  has  been  sub- 
j:ted  to  a  number  of  strong  earthquakes  as  follows:

However,  in  areas  where  no  landslide-related  dam- 
age has  occurred,  there  are  no  records  of  any  substan- 
tial damage  to  residential  structures  or  other  light- 
weight short  period  buildings  of  one-  or  two-story 
construction. 

While  San  Francisco  Bay  fills  might  be  subjected 
to  somewhat  stronger  ground  motions  than  those  listed 
above,  the  performance  of  the  Anchorage  soils  is  in- 
dicative of  the  fact  that  if  settlement,  liquefaction,  and 
landsliding  are  avoided,  ground  shaking  on  filled  areas 
will  not  necessarily  lead  to  any  appreciable  damage  to 
appropriately  designed  structures  during  strong  earth- 
quakes. 

EARTHQUAKE-RESISTANT  DESIGN  PRECAUTIONS  IN 
CONNECTION  WITH  DEVELOPMENT  OF  BAY  FILLS 

In  the  light  of  the  preceding  discussion,  the  follow- 
ing design  precautions  should  be  noted  in  connection 
with  the  earthquake-resistance  features  of  San  Fran- 
cisco Bay  fills:

Recognition  of  Major  Problems 

Engineers,  land  developers  and  public  authorities 
responsible  for  the  construction  of  bay  fills  should  be 
fully  cognizant  of  the  major  problems  (subsidence, 
settlement,  landsliding,  liquefaction,  and  ground  shak- 
ing) which  may  develop  and  ensure  that  appropriate 
steps  are  taken  to  reduce  the  effects  of  these  problems 
to  acceptable  limits. 

Provision  of  Adequate  Density  in  Fill 

In  order  to  ensure  that  no  detrimental  settlements 
will  occur  during  earthquakes  due  to  compaction  of 
the  fill  itself,  the  fill  should  be  placed  during  construc- 
tion in  a  sufficiently  dense  condition  that  additional 
compaction  by  earthquake-induced  ground  motions 
will  be  minimal.  This  requirement  is  likely  to  be  met 
automatically  in  well-compacted  fills  meeting  the  usual 
specifications  for  these  materials  (a  degree  of  compac- 
tion of  at  least  90  percent  on  the  modified  AASHO 
compaction  test).  However,  it  may  require  special 
studies  in  the  case  of  hydraulically  deposited  sand  fills. 

Investigation  of  Probable  Settlement  of  Foundation  Soils 

In  addition  to  ensuring  that  settlement  of  the  fill 
itself  will  be  minimal,  an  evaluation  should  also  be 
made  of  the  settlement  likely  to  develop  during  an 
earthquake  due  to  compaction  of  underlying  founda- 
tion soils.  Such  settlements  may  vary  from  negligible 
settlements  for  clays  to  substantial  amounts  for  loose 
cohesionless  soils. 

Investigation  of  Liquefaction  Potential 

In  all  fill  projects  involving  loose  or  medium  dense 
saturated  silts  or  sands  (either  as  fill  itself  or  as  a  foun- 
dation for  some  other  type  of  fill)  a  careful  appraisal 
should  be  made  of  the  possibility  of  liquefaction  of  the 
soil  during  earthquakes  and  the  possible  consequences 
of  such  liquefaction.  For  this  purpose  previous  expe- 
rience of  soil  liquefaction  during  earthquakes  should 
be  utilized  to  the  fullest  possible  extent  together  with 
appropriate  analytical  techniques.  It  should  be  recog- 
nized that  broad  generalizations  cannot  be  made  in 
connection  with  liquefaction  phenomena  and  that  each 
case  should  be  evaluated  separately  with  due  consid- 
eration being  given  to  the  maximum  probable  severity 
of  earthquake  ground  motions,  the  depth  of  the  water 
table  and  the  density  of  the  sand  or  silt  deposit.  In 
cases  where  liquefaction  may  develop,  steps  should  be 
taken  (e.g.,  use  of  greater  depth  of  soil  above  water 
table,  densification  of  soil)  to  eliminate  this  possi- 
bility. 

Evaluation  of  Slide  Potential 

The  best  possible  evaluation  should  be  made  of  the 
possibility  of  landslides  occurring  due  to  (1)  flow 
slides  in  saturated  sands,  (2)  liquefaction  of  sand  seams 
or  lenses  within  clay  deposits,  (3)  the  driving  forces 
exceeding  the  resistance  of  saturated  fill  and  founda- 
tion soils,  or  (4)  surface  slumping  of  fill  slopes.  All 
slopes  should  be  conservatively  designed  to  reduce  the 
risk  and  consequences  of  any  slide  development  to 
acceptable  limits. 


Consideration  of  Probable  Nature  of  Ground 
Surface  Shaking 

After  ensuring  that  all  major  stability  problems  in- 
volving permanent  displacements  of  the  fill  or  founda- 
tion materials  have  been  eliminated  or  reduced  to 
tolerable  proportions,  consideration  should  be  given 
to  the  probable  nature  of  the  ground  shaking  to  which 
structures  supported  on  the  fill  will  be  subjected. 
These  motions  will  not  be  influenced  significantly  by 
foundation  type  (footings,  piles,  piers,  etc.)  but  they 
will  depend  in  large  measure  on  the  magnitude  of  the 
earthquake,  the  epicentral  distance,  and  the  nature  of 
the  entire  soil  deposit  (including  fill)  overlying  base 
rock  at  the  site. 

From  a  knowledge  of  the  soil  conditions  and  the 
probable  magnitude  and  location  of  the  design  earth- 
quake, it  is  possible  to  estimate  a  response  spectrum 
characterizing  the  nature  of  the  ground  surface  mo- 
tions and  their  influence  on  buildings.  This  is  particu- 
larly necessary  in  the  case  of  fills  over  deep  layers  of 
bay  mud  since  the  response  spectrum  for  these  condi- 
tions is  likely  to  differ  appreciably  from  the  average 
spectra  used  for  other  purposes.  Buildings  at  the  site 
should  then  be  designed  to  safely  withstand  the  max- 
imum seismic  forces  indicated  by  the  response  spec- 
trum in  addition  to  the  static  stresses  imposed  by 
normal  loads  and  any  differential  settlements.  In  gen- 
eral, since  the  predominant  period  of  the  ground  mo- 
tions is  likely  to  be  relatively  high  for  areas  underlain 
by  thick  layers  of  bay  mud,  seismic  risks  and  seismic 
forces  due  to  shaking  are  likely  to  be  least  for  short 
period  one-story  structures  of  moderate  floor  area, 
and  seismic  forces  will  be  large  for  multi-story  struc- 
tures. 

Foundations 

Since  the  soil  underlying  a  building  will  be  sub- 
jected to  some  degree  of  horizontal  and  vertical  dis- 
placements during  an  earthquake,  it  is  desirable  to 
minimize  differential  displacements  at  the  base  of  the 
structure  as  far  as  possible.  Thus  consideration  should 
be  given  to  the  use  of  stiff  mat  or  grid  type  founda- 
tions or  where  buildings  are  supported  on  piles,  to  the 
provision  of  stiff  connections  between  individual  foot- 
ings. Such  foundation  systems  would  also  help  to 
minimize  the  stresses  developed  in  the  buildings  by 
any  differential  settlements  which  develop  due  to  static 
load  effects. 

With  regard  to  the  performance  of  pile  foundations 
during  earthquakes,  there  is  good  evidence  to  show 
that  the  use  of  piles  in  areas  subjected  to  earthquake- 
induced  settlements,  can  prevent  major  damage  to  the 
buildings.  However,  in  the  design  of  pile  foundations, 
the  following  precautions  should  be  observed: 

1.  Presently  available  evidence  indicates  that  the 
presence  of  piles  is  not  likely  to  affect  significantly 
the  nature  of  the  ground  shaking  to  which  a  building 
is  subjected. 

2.  If  piles  are  driven  into  granular  soils  in  which 
settlement  may  be  induced  by  the  ground  shaking, 
settlement  and  possibly  differential  settlement  of  the 
building  foundation  will  result  (see  page  90).

3.  If  the  soil  around  a  pile  settles  during  an  earth- 
quake, the  pile  will  be  subjected  to  an  additional  down- 
wards force  by  the  surrounding  soil. 

4.  Even  if  the  soil  at  the  lower  end  of  a  pile  pro- 
vides adequate  supporting  capacity,  liquefaction  of  a 
substantial  section  of  loose  sand  near  the  upper  end 
of  a  pile  foundation  may  permit  lateral  movement  of 
the  pile  caps  accompanied  by  bending  or  possibly 
buckling  of  the  piles. 

5.  Vertical  piles  are  not  likely  to  provide  any  sub- 
stantial degree  of  resistance  to  translation  of  a  building 
due  to  lateral  slippage  in  the  underlying  soils. 

Lateral  Pressures 

Retaining  walls  should  be  designed  to  withstand 
seismic  forces  developed  in  the  backfill  materials  in 
addition  to  the  usual  static  pressures. 

Utilities 

Special  precautions  should  be  taken  in  the  design  and 
instruction  of  utility  systems  to  ensure  that  they 
re  sufficiently  flexible  to  withstand  the  ground  mo- 
ions  induced  during  an  earthquake.  In  addition  pre- 
cautions such  as  automatic  shut-off  valves  should  be 
nstalled  to  minimize  hazards  in  the  event  the  system 
e  disrupted. 

In  the  light  of  the  above  list  of  desirable  precautions, 
:  is  clear  that  construction  of  buildings  on  fills  over- 
ling bay  deposits  involves  considerably  more  poten- 
al  hazards  than  construction  on  rock  or  dense,  hard 
)il  deposits.  On  the  latter  materials  in  areas  away 
:om  the  fault  trace,  the  only  hazard  resulting  from  an 
irthquake  is  likely  to  be  the  shaking  induced  by  the 
round  motions.  On  the  other  hand,  for  earth  fills  over 
ay  deposits,  major  hazards  to  be  considered  in  ad- 
ition  to  ground  shaking  include  subsidence  and  settle- 
ent  due  to  compaction,  landslides  due  to  various 
Dssible  causes  and  liquefaction. 

However,  the  existence  of  potential  hazards  does  not 
ean  that  adequate  design  measures  cannot  be  taken 
&gt;  reduce  their  significance  to  acceptable  proportions, 
in  all  types  of  engineering  structures.  In  the  case  of 
1'iy  fills  at  the  present  stage  of  technology,  this  is 
icely  to  be  more  difficult  in  the  prevention  of  land- 
;des  than  in  minimizing  the  possibility  of  liquefaction 
&lt;  new  fills  or  the  effects  of  subsidence  due  to  com- 


paction, and  special  care  is  therefore  required  in  evalu- 
ating landslide  possibilities.  Nevertheless,  if  suitable 
engineering  solutions  to  the  design  problems  listed 
above  are  developed,  there  is  no  reason  why  construc- 
tion on  bay  fills  should  not  be  considered  as  satisfac- 
tory from  a  seismic  hazard  standpoint  as  other  building 
sites  in  the  bay  area. 

CURRENT  RESEARCH  AND  DESIRABLE  OBSERVATIONS 

At  the  present  time  there  is  a  considerable  amount 
of  research  activity  on  soil  behavior  during  earth- 
quakes which  is  leading  to  a  better  understanding  of 
the  problems  involved  and  better  methods  for  evalu- 
ating and  analyzing  these  problems.  These  activities 
include: 

1.  Detailed  studies  of  soil  failures  in  previous  earth- 
quakes leading  to  more  valuable  experience  records 
by  which  to  judge  the  potential  hazards  of  other  site 
conditions. 

2.  Analyses  of  ground  response  during  earthquakes. 

3.  Analyses  of  soil  liquefaction  during  earthquakes. 

4.  Studies  of  slope  stability  during  earthquakes. 

5.  The  development  of  new  methods  of  testing 
soils  to  evaluate  the  significant  characteristics  deter- 
mining their  behavior  during  earthquakes. 

Jn  view  of  the  previously  limited  knowledge  of 
these  subjects  and  the  potential  hazards  involved,  it  is 
desirable  that  soil  engineers  responsible  for  the  design 
and  construction  of  bay  fills  should  keep  in  close 
touch  with  these  developments. 

Since  field  observations  play  such  an  important  role 
in  the  development  of  design  practice,  it  is  also  de- 
sirable that  detailed  observation  be  made  of  the  be- 
havior of  filled  areas  during  future  earthquakes.  These 
observations  should  include  records  of  ground  mo- 
tions in  filled  areas  and  records  of  corresponding 
motions  on  nearby  rock  outcrops.  Suitable  acceler- 
ometers  can  now  be  installed  at  a  cost  of  about  $5,000 
to  $6,000  per  instrument,  but  it  seems  likely  that 
within  one  or  two  years  the  development  of  new 
instruments  will  reduce  these  cost  figures  by  perhaps 
50  percent.  Detailed  analysis  of  such  instrumental  rec- 
ords and  other  aspects  of  the  fill  performance  will 
provide  a  valuable  guide  to  the  probable  behavior  of 
the  fill  in  subsequent  earthquakes,  possibly  of  larger 
magnitude,  and  thereby  provide  an  improved  basis  for 
design  and  construction  procedures.

SEISMIC  RISK  TO  BUILDINGS  AND  STRUCTURES 
ON  FILLED  LANDS  IN  SAN  FRANCISCO  BAY 

By  Karl  V.  Steinbrugge 


INTRODUCTION 

In  recent  years,  authorities  from  various  scientific 
and  professional  disciplines  have  been  in  controversy 
over  the  seismic  risk  to  structures  located  on  San 
Francisco  Bay  fills.  Statements  have  been  made,  or 
implied,  that  range  from  serious  damage  and  destruc- 
tion of  all  buildings  and  structures  on  bay  fills  to 
predictions  of  superior  performance — even  superior  to 
structures  founded  on  any  other  foundation  material 
than  bay  mud.  It  is  one  purpose  of  this  report  to 
review  portions  of  the  background  history,  as  well 
as  to  review  certain  aspects  of  the  present  state  of 
the  art  of  structural  design  on  bay  fills,  and  to  do 
this  in  nontechnical  language. 

A  second  purpose  of  this  report  is  to  delineate  some 
of  the  factors  that  determine  the  various  types  of 
seismic  risk  from  the  structural  engineering  stand- 
point. Seismic  risk  depends  on  many  variables  such  as 
the  type  of  construction,  as  well  as  the  type  of  soil 
beneath  a  structure.  Seismic  risk  is  also  one  of  view- 
point; for  example,  serious  building  damage  does  not 
necessarily  require  an  equal  hazard  to  life. 

Detailed  engineering  design  methods  for  the  con- 
struction of  foundations  on  structurally  poor  soils 
have  been  treated  in  many  scientific  and  professional 
books  and  papers,  and  a  discussion  of  them  would  be 
out  of  place  in  this  report.  The  additional  problem 
of  seismic  design  of  structures  founded  on  fills  over 
poor  soils  such  as  bay  muds,  is  a  changing  problem 
due  to  the  rapidly  developing  knowledge  of  soil  re- 
sponse to  earthquake  forces.  Professor  Harry  Seed 
in  a  companion  report  discusses  the  response  of  vari- 
ous types  of  soils  to  earthquake  forces,  while  this 
report  is  oriented  toward  the  performance  of  build- 
ings on  these  soils. 

Seismic  risk,  or  earthquake  hazard,  is  a  major  prob- 
lem in  the  design  and  construction  of  bay  fills  and 
buildings  on  these  fills.  As  a  basis  for  evaluating  seismic 
risk,  it  is  first  necessary  to  establish  the  probability 
of  a  damaging  or  disastrous  earthquake  occurring 
within  reasonable  limits  of  time.  Secondly,  seismic 
risk  involves  the  stability  of  the  fill  in  the  event  of  an 


earthquake.  This  subject  is  covered  in  a  companion 
report  by  Professor  Seed,  and  will  be  given  a  brief, 
generalized  treatment  from  the  structural  engineer's 
standpoint  in  this  report.  Thirdly,  the  performance 
of  structures  on  bay  fills  will  vary  with  the  stability 
of  the  fills,  materials  used  in  building  construction, 
the  physical  dimensions  of  the  structures,  and  the 
nature  of  the  ground  motions.  It  is  important  to  re- 
state that  the  seismic  risk  to  life  may  be  quite  dif- 
ferent from  that  to  property. 

This  report  has  made  extensive  use  of  material 
gathered  by  the  author  for  a  planned  monograph  on 
"Earthquake  Hazard  in  the  San  Francisco  Bay  Area:  A 
Continuing  Problem  in  Public  Policy,"  to  be  published 
by  the  Institute  of  Governmental  Studies  at  the  Uni- 
versity of  California,  Berkeley.  Seismic  risk  on  bay  fills 
is  only  one  phase  of  the  earthquake  hazard  in  the  San 
Francisco  Bay  Area. 

FREQUENCY  OF  DAMAGING  EARTHQUAKES 

First,  in  any  seismic  risk  determination,  it  is  neces- 
sary to  have  a  reasonable  estimate  of  the  frequency 
of  damaging  earthquakes.  Elaborate  plans  are  under 
way  by  the  Federal  government  that  may  some  day 
develop  a  reliable  method  for  earthquake  prediction. 
However,  at  the  present,  it  is  not  possible  to  ac- 
curately predict  the  time,  place,  and  size  of  an  earth- 
quake. 

The  best  method  at  present  for  determining  the 
earthquake  frequency  is  to  review  past  seismic  history, 
and  to  judge  accordingly. 

One  study  of  the  seismic  history  of  Alameda, 
Contra  Costa,  Marin,  San  Francisco,  San  Mateo,  and 
Santa  Clara  Counties  made  for  the  author,  showed 
that  about  12  damaging  earthquakes  have  occurred 
per  century  during  the  brief  historical  record.  By 
"damaging  earthquake"  is  meant  one  that  caused  dam- 
age in  at  least  one  location;  by  no  means  does  it 
imply  that  the  shock  was  necessarily  felt  through- 
out the  entire  San  Francisco  Bay  area.  The  12 
earthquakes  per  century  were  not  evenly  spaced 
in  time,  strength,  or  geography.  For  example,  the  fol-

lowing  is  a  list  of  all  recent  damaging  earthquakes 
centered  in  the  bay  area  and  adjoining  counties: 

April  25,  1954:  Watsonville 

September  4,  1955:  San  Jose 

October  23,  1955:  Walnut  Creek 

March  22,  1957:  San  Francisco  (Daly  City) 

September  14,  1963:  Chittenden 

There  have  been  no  damaging  earthquakes  since 
1963,  and  no  periodicity  is  indicated  from  these  data. 
It  is  more  pertinent  to  study  the  occurrence  of 
great  earthquakes  than  the  more  frequent  moderate 
shocks,  since  it  is  the  great  earthquake  that  determines 
the  full  scope  of  seismic  risk.  The  historical  record 
has  five  entries  that  are  generally  accepted  to  be  the 
largest  shocks  in  the  bay  area  in  historical  times.  These 
are  as  follows: 

June  10,  1836,  on  the  Hayward  fault.  At  7:30  a.m., 
cracks  and  fissures  opened  up  along  this  fault  from 
San  Pablo  to  Mission  San  Jose. 
June,  1838,  probably  on  the  San  Andreas  fault.  A 
fissure  was  described  and  has  been  associated  with 
the  San  Andreas  fault  from  near  San  Francisco  to 
near  Santa  Clara. 

October  8,  1865,  probably  on  the  San  Andreas  fault. 
Considerable  damage  occurred  in  San  Francisco. 
The  earthquake  presumably  had  its  epicenter  on  the 
San  Andreas  fault  in  the  Santa  Cruz  Mountains. 
October  21,  1868,  on  the  Hayward  fault.  At  7:53 
a.m.,  cracks  and  fissures  from  this  earthquake 
formed  from  about  San  Leandro  to  about  Warm 
Springs.  Damage  was  extensive  in  sections  of  San 
Francisco,  and  was  very  heavy  in  the  town  of  Hay- 
ward. 

April  18,  1906,  on  the  San  Andreas  fault.  At  5:13 
a.m.,  the  well-known  San  Francisco  earthquake  oc- 
curred. Faulting  extended  from  southern  Humboldt 
County  to  near  San  Juan  Bautista  in  San  Benito 
County. 

Undoubtedly  all  of  these  earthquakes  were  of  dif- 
ferent Richter  magnitudes,  but  it  appears  that  all  were 
of  sufficient  size  to  approach  or  equal  the  maximum 
probable  earthquake  intensities  to  be  expected  on  at 
least  major  sections  of  San  Francisco  Bay  area.  Instru- 
mental data  do  not  exist  for  the  pre- 1906  shocks,  and 
the  historical  data  are  also  meager  for  the  1836  and 
1838  shocks. 

We  may  also  note  from  the  foregoing  tabulation 
that  the  time  distribution  of  major  earthquakes  is  not 
at  all  uniform.  This  has  also  been  noted  elsewhere 
in  the  world  on  a  larger  time  scale.  For  example,  the 
time  distribution  of  Japanese  earthquakes  since  684 
A.D.  has  three  periods  of  great  seismic  activity,  with 
periods  of  lesser  seismic  activity  between.  This  un- 
even time  distribution  is  an  important  additional 
unknown  in  the  estimation  of  earthquake  frequency 
based  on  the  historical  record. 

The  foregoing  tabulation  shows  that  the  largest  bay 
area  earthquakes  are  related  to  major  known  geologi- 
callv  active  faults.  However,  data  from  seismic  mstru- 


California  Division  of  Mines  and  Geology

ments  show  that  small  earthquakes  in  the  bay  area 
do  not  necessarily  fall  on  known  faults  (figure  1). 

In  general  in  the  western  United  States,  large  earth- 
quakes with  large  surface  ruptures  can  be  related  to 
clearly  defined  geologic  faults.  While  geologists  can 
not  guarantee  that  there  are  no  major  active  faults 
under  the  bay  except  possibly  for  the  northerly  ex- 
tensions of  the  Hayward  and  Calaveras  faults  under 
San  Pablo  Bay,  it  seems  unreasonable  to  postulate  a 
major  seismic  event  on  an  unknown  fault  havingj 
surface  rupturing  under  the  bay. 

Based  on  the  foregoing,  seismic  risk  is  therefore 
essentially  confined  to  the  vibratory  effects  on  bay 
sediments  and  man-made  bay  fills,  and  to  the  vibra- 
tory effects  on  buildings  located  on  these  soils.  Ii 
geologists  deem  the  northerly  extensions  of  the  Hay- 
ward and  Calaveras  faults  to  be  potentially  active,  I 
would  be  imprudent  to  allow  the  development  of  fill: 
in  these  fault  zones,  since  stable  man-made  structure: 
are  not  economically  feasible  under  these  conditions 
and  since  life  safety  normally  would  be  impaired  ever 
with  special  design  precautions. 

It  should  be  added  that  the  movements  on  the  prin 
cipal  active  faults  in  the  bay  area  have  been  of  tht 
strike-slip  type  (i.e.,  the  ground  surface  on  one  sid&lt; 
moving  horizontally  with  respect  to  the  other),  wit! 
very  small  vertical  components.  Similar  ground  move 
ments  can  be  expected  in  the  future.  Thus  there  is  n&lt; 
need  to  be  concerned  about  an  otherwise  stable  eartl 
fill  disappearing  beneath  the  bay,  due  to  a  vertica 
drop  of  bedrock  over  thousands  of  square  miles  a 
occurred  in  Alaska  in  1964  and  in  Chile  in  1960. 

Returning  to  the  problem  of  earthquake  frequency 
it  has  been  repeatedly  shown  by  precise  triangulatio: 
carried  out  bv  the  U.  S.  Coast  and  Geodetic  Surve; 
that  the  earth's  surface  in  the  San  Francisco  Bay  are 
is  being  strained  bv  measurable  amounts.  For  example 
the  Farallon  Islands  west  of  the  Golden  Gate  ar 
moving  northwesterly  with  respect  to  Mt.  Diablo  l 
Contra  Costa  County.  The  direction  of  relative  move 
ment  is  similar  wherever  measured  across  the  Sa: 
Andreas  fault,  namely  that  the  west  side  is  gom 
northerly  with  respect  to  the  east  side  of  this  faul 
It  is  a  commonly  held  theory  that  when  the  strair! 
become  too  great  within  the  earth's  crust,  then  ruptur 
will  take  place.  A  sudden  rupture  generates  seism: 
waves  which  constitute  an  earthquake.  This  ruptur 
normallv  termed  faulting,  will  occur  along  the  weal 
est  zone  in  the  earth's  crust.  This  weakest  zone 
normally  one  which  has  had  previous  movements  o 
it  and  this  zone  is  called  a  fault  zone  The  pon 
beneath  the  earth's  surface  where  the  faulting  nr 
starts  is  defined  as  the  focus,  while  the  point  on  t 
earth's  surface  directly  above  the  focus  is  the  eartl 
quake's  epicenter. 

The  measured  accumulating  strains  in  the  earth 
crust  in  the  San  Francisco  Bay  area  have  allowe 
the  computation  of  earthquake  frequency  estimates  t 
dividing  the  average  of  the  largest  fault  displacemen 
in  the  1906  earthquake  by  the  average  rate  of  accurni 
lating  strain  to  get  the  probable  number  of  years  b 
tween  earthquakes.  This  number  formerly  came  oun

reasonable  figure  of  60  to  75  or  more  years,  depend- 
tr  upon  the  interpretation  of  the  data.  However,  with 
k,  very  recent  discovery  of  fault  creep  from  San  Pablo 
■ougn  Fremont  on  the  Hayward  fault,  the  earth- 
ke  prediction  calculations  are  open  to  greater  ques- 
.  It  is  now  known  that  the  Hayward  fault  slipped, 
»  faulted,  for  about  half  a  foot  in  the  City  of  Fre- 
nmt  some  time  between- 1949  and  1957  without  a 
T'orded  earthquake;  no  movement  is  now  being 
o served.  Other  sections  of  the  Hayward  fault  are 
p  forming  differently;  for  example,  movements  are 
crently  damaging  the  University  of  California  sta- 
ll m  in  Berkeley.  Details  of  this  fault  slippage  may 
b  found  in  the  Bulletin  of  the  Seismological  Society 
D.America,  Vol.  50,  pp.  257/323  (April,  1966).  We 
■3*  conclude  that  the  strains  in  the  bay  area  are 
^ltinuing  to  accumulate,  although  a  part  of  them 
»  probably  being  released  by  fault  slippage.  It  is 


reasonable  to  assume  that  the  large  historic  earth- 
quakes and  the  recent  fault  slippage  represent  typical 
characteristics  of  the  Hayward  fault,  and  that  despite 
gradual  release  of  part  of  the  strain,  earthquakes  are  to 
be  expected  on  this  fault  in  the  future. 

The  foregoing  discussion  is  a  brief  overview  of  the 
problems  inherent  in  predicting  an  earthquake  for  the 
San  Francisco  Bay  area.  On  the  basis  of  a  thorough 
study  of  the  historical  record  and  in  view  of  the 
accumulating  strains,  it  is  reasonable  to  expect  a  maxi- 
mum intensity  earthquake  in  the  San  Francisco  Bay 
area  once  in  every  60  to  100  years.  This  is  sufficiently 
frequent  to  require  that  all  structures  and  fills  in  the 
San  Francisco  Bay  be  designed  to  resist  the  forces  of 
a  great  earthquake,  such  as  those  originating  from  the 
San  Francisco  1906  shock. 

The  San  Francisco  1906  shock  is  the  largest  earth- 
quake in  the  bay  area  for  which  detailed  information 


106 

is  available.  It  is  a  fair  question  to  ask  if  this  is  the 
largest  credible  earthquake  to  be  expected  in  the 
future.  This  problem  has  been  reasonably  well  an- 
swered bv  seismologists  who,  by  calculations  made 
from  their  seismographic  records,  can  determine  an 
earthquake's  magnitude.  The  magnitude  of  an  earth- 
quake is  a  measure  of  its  size;  the  numerical  value  of 
the  magnitude,  which  is  on  a  logarithmic  basis,  is 
related  to  the  energy  released  by  the  earthquake.  T.  he 
largest  earthquakes  in  the  world  recorded  by  seismo- 
graphs for  over  half  a  century  are  not  much  greater 
in  magnitude  than  that  of  the  1906  San  Francisco 
shock,  and  therefore  the  forces  generated  by  the  1906 
San  Francisco  earthquake  appear  to  be  a  reasonable 
upper  limit.  The  duration  of  the  damaging  intensities, 
however,  may  be  substantially  longer  than  that  ex- 
perienced in  1906. 

In  recapitulation,  for  planning  purposes  the  fre- 
quency of  large  earthquakes  developing  maximum  in- 
tensities in  at  least  major  sections  of  San  Francisco 
Bay  may  be  reasonablv  assumed  at  from  60  to  100 
years.  (These  figures  should  not  be  used  for  predic- 
tion purposes.)  Further,  the  forces  released  by  the 
1906  San  Francisco  shock  would  also  be  a  reasonable 
maximum  for  future  great  shocks,  but  the  duration 
may  be  substantially  longer. 

EARTHQUAKE  EFFECTS  TO  BUILDINGS  ON  BAY  FILLS 
Effects  of  the  Largest  Earthquakes  in  San  Francisco  Bay 
The  basis  for  much  of  the  criticism  which  has  been 
directed  toward  the  development  of  and  the  construc- 
tion on  bav  fills  is  their  performance  in  past  large 
earthquakes.  Additionally,  fills  have  performed  poorly 
during  earthquakes  elsewhere  throughout  the  world. 
It  is  of  value  to  critically  review  in  detail  the  his- 
torical record  for  the  bay  area. 

There  are  insufficient  data  on  the  1836  and  1838 
earthquakes  to  establish  firm  conclusions,  but  the 
1865,  1868,  and  1906  shocks  have  been  described  in 
varying  detail.  San  Francisco,  being  the  only  city 
having  significant  portions  of  its  land  area  on  man- 
made  fills  at  the  time  of  these  earthquakes,  was  the 
location  of  most  of  the  damage  related  to  man-made 
fills.  It  is  appropriate  to  point  out  that  in  Santa  Rosa 
in  1906,  for  example,  intensified  earthquake  damage 
also  occurred  to  buildings  located  on  the  deep,  un- 
consolidated, naturally  deposited  alluvial  soils;  indeed, 
it  is  possible  for  naturally  deposited  soils  to  be  as 
hazardous  as  the  poorest  man-made  fill. 

The  available  damage  data  for  San  Francisco  have 
been  well  summarized  in  "The  California  Earthquake 
of  April  18,  1906,  Report  of  the  State  Earthquake 
Investigation  Commission"  (Carnegie  Institution  of 
Washington,  1908-10,  two  volumes  and  atlas,  hence- 
forth called  the  "Commission  Report." 

Regarding  the  October  8,  1865,  earthquake  which 
apparently  was  centered  in  the  Santa  Cruz  Mountains, 
the  "Commission  Report"  states  on  page  449  of  Vol.  I: 

"On  the  marshy  lands  in  the  vicinity  of  Howard  and  Sev- 
enth Streets  the  ground  was  heaved  in  some  places  and  sank 
in  others.  Lamp  posts  were  thrown  out  of  perpendicular,  gas 
pipes  were  broken,  etc."

The  October  21,  1868,  earthquake  on  the  HaywarrJ 
fault  also  caused  damage  in  San  Francisco,  and  the 
"Commission  Report"  states  on  pages  436-37  oi 
Vol.  I: 

"The  portion  of  the  city  which  suffered  most  was  that  part 
of  the  business  district,  embracing  about  200  acres,  built  on 
'made  ground';  that  is,  the  ground  made  by  filling  in  the 
cove  of  Yerba  Buena.  The  bottom  of  this  cove  was  a  soft 
mud  varying  from  10  to  80  feet  in  depth,  and  the  materia! 
used  to  fill  it  was  largely  'dump'  refuse,  much  of  which  is 
organic  and  hence  perishable.  Many  of  the  buildings  of  that 
period  were  built  flat  on  this  filled  mud,  without  piling,  and 
before  the  land  had  had  time  to  become  firm.  On  this  made 
land  there  was  a  very  evident  belt  of  maximum  damage 
several  hundred  feet  wide  and  running  about  northwest  and 
southeast,  commencing  near  the  custom-house  and  ending  at 
the  Folsom  Street  wharf.   ... 

"In  many  places  the  made  land  settled.  At  the  junction  of 
Market  and  Front  Streets,  the  ground  sank  for  a  foot  or  two, 
and  there  was  evidence  that  the  tide  had  risen  in  the  ad- 
joining lot  at  the  same  time,  for  a  pond  of  water  collected 
and  remained  until  low  tide.   .   .   . 

"At  the  corner  of  First  and  Market  Streets,  the  ground 
opened  in  a  fissure  several  inches  wide.  At  other  places  the 
ground  opened  and  water  was  forced  above  the  surface.  At 
Fremont  and  Mission  Streets  the  ground  opened  in  many 
places.  The  general  course  of  damage  in  the  city  was  along 
the  irregular  line  of  the  'made  land,'  or  low  alluvial  soil, 
where  it  met  the  hard  or  rocky  base  beneath  it  .   .   .  ." 

The  April  18,  1906  earthquake  has  been  studied  i 
great  detail  bv  manv  authorities.  Probably  the  mo: 
thorough  and  generally  accepted  study  of  the  n 
tensity  and  the  relationship  of  damage  to  ground  coi 
ditions  in  San  Francisco  was  made  by  H.  O.  Woo 
and  published  in  the  "Report  of  the  State  Earthqual 
Investigation  Commission"  (Volume  1,  pp.  220/241 
It  is  of  value  to  quote  some  of  the  major  points  mac 
in  this  study: 

"About   the    Ferry   Building,   at   the    foot   of   Market   Street, 
is  a   district  of  'made'   land   shown    on   map   (present  author's 
note-  see  Figure  2  of  this  report),  in  which  high  intensity  was 
manifested.    Here   buildings   of   all   sorts   were   crowded    close 
together.    Wooden    buildings,    1    story   to   3   stories   high,   with 
brick  or  stone  work  fronts,  were  interspersed  among   ordinary 
brick  buildings  from  2  to  6  or  8   stories  in   height.  Mingled 
with    these   was   a    considerable    number    of    modern,    class    A, 
office    buildings.    Here    the    fire    burned    fiercely    and    caused 
great    havoc.   .   .   .  After    the    fire    had    past,    standing    walls 
revealed     ugly,    sinuous    cracks,    in     rudely    parallel    systems, 
which   were  not  due  to  fire   nor  to  dynamite.  Masonry  blocks 
in   the   walls   of    excellent    modern    buildings   were    broken    ai 
by   a   blow.   Rivets   were   sheared    off    in    parts   of   the    frame- 
work of  steel  structures,  and  tension  rods  in  such  frames  were 
badly    stretched.    Tubular    cast-iron    columns,    supporting    floor 
girders,    were    broken    off    near    their    bases    in    cellars   where 
they    rested    upon    piling.    The    concrete    casing    of    piles    was 
frequently     broken.    Wherever    the     intensity    was    high,    the 
tendency  to  crack  or  crush   near  the  base,  as  though  a  sharp 
blow    had    been    struck    there,    was    notably    conspicuous.     In 
spots   the    streets    sank    bodily,    certainly    as    much    as    2    feet, 
probably   more.  Accompanying  this  depression,  concrete  base- 
ment floors  were  broken  and  arched,  as  if  to  compensate  for 
it.  The  surface   of  the  ground   was  deformed   into  waves   and 
small    open    fissures    were    formed,    especially    close    to    the 
wharves.    Buildings    on    the    water    side,    along     East    Street, 
generally  slumped  seaward,  in  some  cases  as  much  as  2  feet. 
The  damage  was  greatest  close  to  the  water's  edge,  growing 
less    as   the    solid    land    was    approached,    gradually    at    first, 
then  more  rapidly  (page  233). 

"It  is  important  to  recognize  that,  despite  the  great  in- 
tensity manifested  near  the  water-front,  first-class  modern 
buildings,  such  as  the  Ferry  Building,  built  on  deep  piling 
or  grillage  foundations,  were  not  imperiled  by  injuries  to 
their  walls  or  framework.  Some  rivets  were  sheared  off;  some 
tension    rods    were    stretched;    an    occasional    girder   was    dis-

lodged,  and  cracks  were  formed  here  and  there  in  the  brick 
and  stone  walls.  Large  financial  loss  was  unquestionably  oc- 
casioned, but  buildings  of  this  type  were  not  in  serious 
danger  of  collapse  nor  of  being  toppled  over,  either  during 
or  after  the  shock  (page  235). 

"The  shaking  caused  the  materials  used  in  filling  to  settle 
together  and  occupy  less  space,  so  that  the  surface  over  the 
whole  district  was  lowered  by  amounts  varying  from  a  few 
inches  to  3  feet  or  more.  This  is  clearly  seen  in  the  change 
of  street  levels  along  the  margin  of  the  solid  ground,  where 
the  car  rails  are  bent  downward  in  little  monoclines.  Occa- 
sionally a  structure  with  a  relatively  good  foundation  remains 
at  its  former  level,  with  whole  neighborhood  depressed  about 
it  (page  237)." 

Wood  concluded: 

"This  investigation  has  clearly  demonstrated  that  the  amount 
of  damage  produced  by  the  earthquake  of  April  18  in  dif- 
ferent parts  of  the  city  and  county  of  San  Francisco  depended 
chiefly  upon  the  geological  character  of  the  ground.  Where 
the  surface  was  of  solid  rock,  the  shock  produced  little 
damage;  whereas  upon  made  land  great  violence  was  mani- 
fested (page  241)." 

The  earthquake  intensity  of  the  1906  shock  as  de- 
termined by  H.  O.  Wood  for  a  portion  of  San  Fran- 
cisco is  shown  in  modified  form  in  Figure  2.  The 
intensity  obviously  varied  greatly  within  short  dis- 
tances and  correlates  with  geology. 

A  critical  reading  of  the  reports  of  the  1906  earth- 
quake also  finds  statements  such  as  these: 

"Buildings  erected  upon  good  foundations  withstood  the 
ordeal  well,  even  when  the  streets  around  them  were  de- 
pressed and  fissured."  ("Commission  Report,"  page  236) 

"Foundations  did  not  suffer  at  all,  no  instances  of  damage 
having  come  to  hand."  ("The  effects  of  the  San  Francisco 
Earthquake  of  April  18,  1906  on  Engineering  Constructions," 
in  Trans.  Am.  Soc.  Civil  Engrs.  59:235  (1907)) 

The  content  of  the  paragraph  including  the  fore- 
going statement  indicates  that  the  writers  may  have 
had  the  taller  fire-resistive  buildings  in  mind,  although 
no  qualifying  statements  were  made. 

The  description  of  the  fill  materials,  as  well  as  the 
description  of  the  natural  marsh  areas,  leaves  a  firm 
impression  that  the  made  ground  was  obviously  of 
poor  structural  quality.  A  most  vivid  description  of 
poor  ground  in  San  Francisco  was  given  by  Hittell 
in  "A  History  of  the  City  of  San  Francisco"  (1878) 
where  he  stated  on  pages  433/34: 

"The  peat  in  the  marshes  that  had  their  heads  near  the 
site  of  the  new  city  hall  was  strong  enough  to  sustain  a 
small  house  or  a  loaded  wagon,  though  a  man,  by  swinging 
himself  from  side  to  side,  or  by  jumping  upon  it,  could  give 
it  a  perceptible  shiver.  There  were  weak  places  in  it,  how- 
ever, and  a  cow  which  in  searching  for  sweet  pasture  under- 
took to  jump  from  one  hard  spot  to  what  appeared  to  be 
another,  made  a  mistake,  for  it  gave  way  under  her  and  a 
gentleman  hunting  nearby  was  surprised  to  see  her  go  down, 
and  still  more  to  observe  that  she  did  not  come  up  again 
.  .  .  Many  ludricous  scenes  occurred  in  filling  up  the  swamps. 
When  streets  were  first  made  the  weight  of  the  sand  pressed 
the  peat  down,  so  that  the  water  stood  where  the  surface 
was  dry  before.  Sometimes  the  sand  broke  through,  carrying 
down  the  peat  under  it,  leaving  nothing  but  water  or  thin 
mud  near  the  surface.  More  than  once  a  contractor  had  put 
on  enough  sand  to  raise  the  street  to  the  official  grade,  and 
gave  notice  to  the  city  engineer  to  inspect  the  work,  but  in 
the  lapse  of  a  day  between  the  notice  and  the  inspection, 
the  sand  had  sunk  down  six  or  eight  feet;  and  when  at  last 
a  permanent  bottom  had  been  reached,  the  heavy  sand  had 
crowded  under  the  light  peat  at  the  sides  of  the  street  and 
lifted  it  up  eight  or  ten  feet  above  its  original  level  ...  so 
that  houses  .  .  .  were  carried  away  from  their  original  posi- 
tion and  tilted   .   .   ." 


The  foregoing  description  may  have  been  consid 
erably  exaggerated;  but  even  so,  the  collapse  of  build 
ings  on  these  soils  during  an  earthquake  would  not  b 
unexpected. 

Certainly  the  seismic  risk  has  been  much  greate 
to  buildings  and  other  man-made  structures  on  ba; 
fills.  The  effects  of  other  great  earthquakes  through, 
out  the  world  generally,  but  not  universally,  hav 
been  similar.  Experience  in  the  bay  area  also  show 
that  buildings  on  piling  perform  better  as  a  class  thai 
do  those  on  footings  resting  directly  on  the  soil.  Thes 
problems  will  be  discussed  by  others  in  companio 
reports. 

In  recent  years,  and  particularly  since  World  Wai 
II,  the  science  and  profession  of  soils  engineering  ha 
greatly  expanded  its  knowledge  and  this  knowledg' 
is  being  almost  universally  applied  to  major  strud 
tures  in  the  bay  area.  Developers  of  housing  tracii 
generally  make  extensive  use  of  soil  engineering  dat; ] 
Soils  engineers  are  now  able  to  give  the  architect  an: 
structural  engineer  vastly  better  data  on  the  strud 
tural  characteristics  of  soils  and  their  probable  eartl1 
quake  performance  than  were  available  at  the  tini 
of  the  large  bay  area  earthquakes  discussed  in  tWj 
section. 

Recent  Experience  from  Moderate  Earthquakes 
in  the  Bay  Area 
There  is  very  little  seismic  experience  of  buildinj 
on  modern  engineered  fills.  Onlv  the  moderate  shoe 
of  March  22,  1957,  centered  in  Daly  City  which  : 
south  of  San  Francisco  can  be  cited.  This  earthqual 
was  studied  by  the  author  and  others,  and  a  summai' 
of  their  findings  is  as  follows: 

"Cuts  and  fills  exist  throughout  the  Westlake  Palisades  tract, 
and  some  of  the  fills  exceed  35  feet.  All  grading  work  was 
under  the  supervision  of  a  qualified  soils  engineering  firm.  As 
indicated  in  previous  paragraphs,  better  than  100  percent  re- 
compaction  was  indicated  from  their  test  samples.  There  was 
no  soils  engineering  supervision  for  the  minor  cuts  and  fills 
made  during  the  actual  house  construction.  The  engineering 
firm  of  Theodore  V.  Tronoff,  Jr.,  evaluated  the  damage  to 
each  dwelling  on  an  arbitrary  scale  having  10  divisions,  and 
the  weighted  results  of  568  dwelling  investigations  showed 
that  houses  on  the  engineered  fills  fared  as  well  or  better 
than  houses  on  cuts  (or  on  original  ground).  Further,  consid- 
erably greater  cuts  and  fills  of  similar  soils  exist  to  the  east 
of  Skyline  Boulevard  and  such  occasional  damage  as  was 
found  was  not  related  to  the  soils.  We  may  conclude  that  the 
recompacted    soil    was    not    a    significant    factor    in    the    dam- 

age".    ... 

"In  an  area  of  ground  settlement  elsewhere  in  this  tract, 
borings  placed  since  the  earthquake  have  revealed  what  may 
have  been  a  garbage  dump,  covered  by  sand  long  before 
the  housing  development  was  started.  This  points  out  the 
need  for  numerous  borings,  in  order  to  catch  local  problems. 
Also,  this  indicates  that  a  detailed  history  of  an  area  may 
be  helpful  in  disclosing  local  conditions  that  may  not  be  re- 
vealed by  borings".  .  .  .  ("Damage  to  Buildings  and  Other 
Structures  During  the  San  Francisco  Earthquake  of  March  11, 
1957,"  by  K.  V.  Steinbrugge,  V.  R.  Bush,  and  E.  G.  Zacher, 
page  81  in  California  Division  of  Mines  Special  Report  #57, 
1959.) 

These  fills  were  not  over  bay  muds  or  other  coi 
pressible  bay  soils,  but  certainly  their  performan 
shows  that  man-made  fills,  per  se,  can  quite  sat 
factorilv  withstand  the  effects  of  moderate  earl 
quakes.' In  contrast,  damage  at  the  San  Francisco  II

:rnational  Airport  about  10  miles  southeast  of  the 
picenter,  was  attributed  to  both  differential  settle- 
lents  and  horizontal  vibratory  forces.  These  airport 
uildings  were  on  piling. 

For  other  recent  earthquake  experience  of  modern 
lis  in  California,  we  must  turn  to  the  July  21,  1952 
[ern  County  earthquake.  Highway  fill  settlements 
rere  noted  on  the  Bakersfield-Tehachapi  highway. 
or  example,  the  fill  at  the  railroad  crossing  near 
'ehachapi  settled  eight  inches  at  its  western  end. 

During  the  1964  Alaskan  earthquake  in  Anchorage, 
quefaction  of  certain  types  of  soils  under  vibratory 
)rces  of  long  duration  caused  spectacular  land  move- 
ients  involving  many  city  blocks.  Professor  Seed, 
fho  is  the  author  of  a  companion  report,  is  in  a  posi- 
pn  to  speak  authoritatively  on  the  nature  and  identi- 
pation  of  soil  liquefaction.  It  appears  that  soil  lique- 
jction,  while  observed  and  described  in  the  1960 
jhilean  and  other  earthquakes,  was  not  adequately 
udied  until  the  1964  Alaskan  earthquake.  This  brings 
b  the  troublesome  question  of  the  seismic  risk  in- 
plved  with  bay  fills  which  have  been  placed  in  recent 
pars,  but  without  benefit  of  this  newer  knowledge 
ji  soil  liquefaction.  Restudying  these  pre- 1964  fills 
lay  reveal  unsuspected  hazards,  but  to  do  so  involves 
je  philosophically  and  politically  troublesome  ques- 
bn  of  retroactive  building  code  laws. 

STRUCTURAL  ENGINEERING  EVALUATION 
OF  BAY  AREA  SEISMIC  HISTORY 

The  historical  records  of  the  large  earthquakes  of 
165,  1868  and  1906  certainly  indicated,  in  general, 
:'or  performance  of  buildings  on  structurally  poor 
jils.  Common  exceptions  were  structures  on  piling, 
-mited  experience  in  moderate  earthquakes  in  the 
:y  area  shows  that  fills  on  firm  ground  can  and  have 
:rformed  excellently,  but  data  are  almost  completely 
"king  on  modern  bay  fill  performance. 
In  view  of  this  meager  experience  on  modern  bay 
Is,  the  laboratory  and  theoretical  approaches  must 
:  fully  utilized.  These  approaches  are  often  used  with 
:ly  the  judgment  of  the  practitioner  extrapolating 
2  results  to  reality. 

The  rapid  development  of  soils  engineering  tech- 
fcues  and  knowledge,  including  the  very  recent  de- 
ropment  of  substantive  knowledge  on  the  poten- 
tly major  hazard  of  soil  liquefaction,  leaves  the 
nter  as  well  as  many  other  structural  engineers  with 
not  entirely  comfortable  feeling  of  the  seismic  risk 
J  bay  fills,  marshlands,  and  other  poorly-consolidated 
uvial  materials. 

t  is  general  practice  for  soils  engineers  to  give 
pund  settlement  figures  (or  differential  settlement 
lures),  often  as  a  function  of  time,  to  the  structural 
:*ineer  for  his  use  in  the  design  for  buildings  located 
&gt;  poor  ground.  It  is  at  this  point  that  economics 
list  be  weighed  against  seismic  risk  as  well  as  other 
•  tors.  The  present  state  of  the  art  does  not  allow  a 
lmerical  equation  of  economics  to  seismic  risk  with- 
K  very  substantial  judgment  factors.  Consider  two 
"ireme  and  quite  impractical  cases: 

.  Remove  the  compressible  bay  soils  and  replace 
tm  with  firm  materials   (an  absurd  case  would  be 


replacing  all  soil  from  bedrock  to  the  ground  surface 
with  concrete). 

2.  Place  a  structure  with  no  special  footing  design 
directly  on  soils  such  as  described  by  Hittel  on  pre- 
vious pages  of  this  report. 

The  first  solution  is  impractical  from  a  cost  stand- 
point, while  the  second  is  impractical  from  a  safety 
standpoint. 

Effects  of  Differential  Settlements  on  Seismic  Risk 

Building  settlements  prior  to  an  earthquake,  par- 
ticularly those  where  one  portion  of  a  building  settles 
more  than  another  portion  (i.e.,  differential  settle- 
ments), can  cause  measurable  strains  in  a  building. 
These  strains  may  result  in  stresses  that  substantially 
weaken  a  structure. 

Figure  3  is  an  extreme  case  of  differential  settle- 
ments to  a  building  constructed  many  years  ago  and 
prior  to  present  day  soils  engineering  techniques. 
These  differential  settlements  have  badly  cracked  the 
walls  and  otherwise  weakened  this  building;  nearby

Figure  3.  Effects  of  differential  settlement  on  a  building.  Differential 
settlements  have  caused  the  center  of  the  building  to 
"hump."  Note  curve  formed  by  the  sidewalk  and  by  the 
window  sills.  This  building  has  many  cracks  in  its  brick 
walls   due   to   differential   settlements. 


buildings  have  settled  differentially  to  the  point  that 
doors  had  to  be  rehung  in  order  to  make  them  oper- 
able. It  becomes  obvious  that  differential  settlements 
can  (and  normally  do)  weaken  a  building  to  the 
extent  that  it  will  perform  poorly  in  an  earthquake. 
In  the  writer's  opinion,  differential  settlements  prior 
to  and  during  an  earthquake  are  a  major  reason  for 
greater  observed  earthquake  damage  to  buildings  on 
made  land.  The  writer  has  had  considerable  personal 
experience  to  substantiate  this  observation.  For  ex- 
ample, in  the  1954  Eureka  (California)  earthquake, 
differential  settlements  prior  to  this  earthquake  had 
caused  damage  in  a  brick  wall  of  a  major  structure; 
moss  was  growing  in  the  crack.  The  crack  moved 
slightly  during  the  earthquake  ("worked")  and  paint

building's  earthquake   resistance. 


and  plaster  which  bridged  portions  of  the  crack  fell 
to  the  floor.  It  was  not  possible  to  convince  persons 
unfamiliar  with  earthquake  engineering  that  the  crack 
in  the  brickwork  was  not  earthquake-induced.  On 
many  other  occasions,  paint  deep  within  a  crack  in  a 
masonry  wall  did  not  convince  some  observers  that 
the  crack  had  existed  prior  to  the  shock  and  that  the 
flaked  paint  on  the  floor  was  merely  the  result  of  the 
failure  of  a  subsequent  coat  of  paint  which  had 
bridged  the  crack.  It  is  not  the  point  of  this  paragraph 
to  discount  the  heavier  damage  that  has  been  found 
in  these  structurally  poor  ground  areas,  but  to  explain 
in  part  the  reason  for  its  existence.  The  comparative 
lack  of  damage  to  pile-supported  structures,  which 
are  not  as  prone  to  differential  settlements,  becomes 
clearer. 

Even  in  modern  structures  where  the  theoretically 
predicted  differential  settlements  perhaps  actually  oc- 
cur as  predicted,  stresses  within  these  structures  are 
almost  always  increased.  In  a  carefully  made  sophisti- 
cated design,  these  stresses  can  be  kept  within  tolerable 
limits.  If,  however,  actual  differential  settlements 
should  prove  to  be  greater  than  anticipated,  then  se- 
rious stresses  may  result.  The  need  for  experienced 
competent  judgment  which  is  required  in  evaluating 
anticipated  differential  settlements  is  not  necessarily 
met  by  a  man  becoming  a  licensed  civil  engineer  and 
opening  his  consulting  office;  the  margin  of  judgment 
error  in  some  cases  can  and  has  been  considerable. 
Also,  the  structural  engineer  has  economic  pressures 
to  increase  the  amount  of  acceptable  differential  set- 
tlements in  his  design.  There  is,  therefore,  a  greater 
likelihood  for  the  modern  average  building  on  bay 
fills  to  have  greater  pre-earthquake  stresses  within  it 


than  for  a  similar  building  on  structurally  firm  so 
or  on  rock. 

The  methods  for  minimizing  differential  settlemem 
in  buildings  on  bay  fills  vary  with  the  type  of  builc 
ing,  as  well  as  type  of  foundation.  Economic  considei 
ations  have  a  major  role  in  the  selection  of  the  typ 
of  foundation.  Piling  has  had  overall  excellent  eartl 
quake  experience  throughout  the  world.  Large  mom 
lithic  mat  footings  beneath  a  structure  have  also  pe: 
formed  well;  differential  settlements  for  this  found 
tion  type  could  cause  a  building  to  "tilt,"  affectin 
elevators  and  other  functional  aspects,  but  not  nece 
sarily  causing  serious  strains.  Indeed,  major  buildinj 
in  a  recent  Japanese  earthquake  tilted  so  far  as  I 
almost  rest  on  their  sides  and  yet  remained  structural! 
intact;  these  are,  of  course,  extreme  examples  of  builj 
ings  remaining  intact  after  foundation  failure.  Inc" 
vidual  footings  which  are  not  interconnected  are  tl! 
least  expensive,  but  are  the  least  satisfactory. 

The  foregoing  dealt  with  footing  types  rather  thi 
soils  beneath  the  footings.  Today's  general  practi 
for  one  and  two-story  buildings  is  to  place  a  blank 
of  carefully  selected  and  compacted  soil  of  many  fe 
in  thickness  over  the  compressible  bay  soils;  tl 
blanket  will  act  as  a  mat  and  light  structures  wi[ 
conventional  footings  resting  on  this  mat  should  n&lt; 
settle  differentially. 

It  is  usually  the  province  of  the  structural  engine*' 
architect,  and/or  developer  to  weigh  the  soils  eni 
neer's  recommendations  against  the  estimated  costs  f 
reducing    differential    settlements   to   some   toleral 
limit.  This  tolerable  limit  is  a  matter  of  judgrm 
and  no  commonly  accepted  standard  exists.  In 
many  instances  costs  have  probably  influenced  ju

nents,  and  this  may  explain  some  of  the  observed 
inferential  settlements  in  relatively  recently  placed 
ills. 

The  historical  record  of  San  Francisco  Bay  area 
arthquakes  indicates  that  tall  buildings  in  poor 
round  areas  have  performed  well.  This  has  been  only 
omparative;  table  1  is  an  indication  of  differential 
sttlements  which  have  been  recorded  in  downtown 
an  Francisco  in  poor  ground  areas,  and  suggests  that 
ignificant  stresses  may  have  developed  in  these  tall 
uildings  since  construction.  Presumably,  modern 
uildings  will  have  less  differential  settlements  because 
f  more  knowledge  and  better  foundation  design. 

Ground  Motions  on  Bay  Fills 

Research,  particularly  in  Japan,  is  showing  that  the 
round  motions  are  different  on  structurally  poor 
rounds  than  on  rock.  The  reasons  for  these  different 
lotions  are  described  in  the  companion  papers  in 
lis  volume.  The  soils  beneath  a  particular  building 
•e  usually  very  complex,  with  varying  soil  strata 
iving  different  dynamic  characteristics;  practical  ex- 
;rience  shows  that  bay  fill  soils  are  very  complicated, 
i  general,  the  frequency  of  earthquake  vibrations 
iow  down — in  other  words,  the  ground  oscillations 
xome  slower — as  seismic  waves  progress  from  bed- 
eck through  less  competent  materials  to  the  building 
:&gt;undation. 

Evidence  from  small  earthquakes  also  indicates  that 
ie  amplitude  of  the  ground  motions  becomes  sub- 
santially  greater  on  structurally  poor  grounds  than 
n  rock;  in  other  words,  ground  motions  are  also 
jnplified  as  they  pass  from  bedrock  through  less  com- 
jtent  materials.  This  amplification  has  been  often 
cmonstrated  in  a  crude  fashion  by  vibrating  a  bowl 
If  jellylike  material.

rigures  are  to  nearest  inch.  Data  based,  in  part,  on  "Building 
foundations  in  San  Francisco,"  by  Charles  H.  Lee  (Proc.  Am. 
Koc.  C.  E.,  Vol.  79,  Separate  No.  325,  1953) 

The  foregoing  factors  have  not  yet  been  incorpo- 
r:ed  into  American  building  codes,  partly  because 
t»  state  of  the  knowledge  is  too  new  and  too  incom- 
f:te.  These  factors  theoretically  can  become  trouble- 
sne  to  long  period  structures.  In  lay  terms,  long 
priod  structures  are  most  commonly  the  high  rise 
Hidings. 

'A  classic  example  of  selective  damage  to  tall  build- 
ups (i.e.,  long  period  structures)  compared  to  rigid 
cie  and  two-story  buildings,  occurred  in  the  July  28, 
1&gt;7,  Mexican  earthquake.  The  earthquake  epicenter 
\s  reported  from  170  to  220  miles  from  Mexico  City. 


Damage  was  pronounced  to  many  of  the  tall  rein- 
forced concrete  and  steel  frame  buildings  in  down- 
town Mexico  City,  and  several  collapsed.  Small  one 
and  two-story  "collapse  hazard"  buildings  performed 
well.  Soils  in  downtown  Mexico  City  consist  of  un- 
consolidated lake  bed  and  other  materials,  and  they 
are  of  exceptionally  poor  structural  quality.  The 
nature  of  the  ground  motions  from  this  distant  earth- 
quake was  such  as  to  selectively  damage  the  long 
period  structures  (multistory  buildings),  but  multi- 
story building  damage  was  far  more  pronounced  in 
the  structurally  poor  ground  areas  than  in  the  nearby 
firmer  ground  areas.  Differential  settlements  obviously 
played  a  role  in  some  of  the  damage,  but  the  author's 
observations  indicate  that  it  was  a  minor  role  in  most 
cases. 

In  a  general  sense,  the  seismic  risk  to  buildings  on 
bay  fills  from  ground  motions  described  in  this  sec- 
tion is  least  for  one  story  light  mass  structures  of  no 
more  than  moderate  floor  area. 


LIFE  SAFETY  VERSUS  PROPERTY  DAMAGE 

Seismic  risk  can  be  viewed  from  different  stand- 
points with  quite  different  results.  Severe  earthquake 
damage  to  property  does  not  necessarily  incur  an  equal 
life  hazard.  A  building  can  become  so  seriously 
cracked  that  repairs  may  be  uneconomical;  however, 
if  building  collapse  does  not  occur,  then  the  build- 
ing's occupants  may  be  able  to  leave  without  harm. 
On  the  other  hand,  the  failure  of  small  value  items, 
such  as  the  collapse  of  light  fixtures  and  the  collapse 
of  non-reinforced  hollow  concrete  block  partitions 
around  stairs,  has  caused  injury  and  even  death. 

A  commonly  accepted  viewpoint  on  seismic  risk  is 
to  take  such  engineering  design  steps  as  may  be  neces- 
sary to  reduce  the  life  hazard  to  an  absolute  minimum, 
and  to  restrict  property  damage  to  reasonable  limits 
in  the  event  of  a  great  earthquake,  such  as  a  repetition 
of  the  1906  shock.  This  philosophy  is  embodied  in 
most  of  today's  building  codes.  There  is,  however, 
no  consensus  on  what  constitutes  a  "reasonable  limit" 
to  earthquake  property  damage.  Some  engineers  may 
be  willing  to  allow  total  loss  to  their  client's  property, 
provided  that  life  safety  is  assured.  This  viewpoint 
is  also  sometimes  held  by  speculative  developers  who, 
through  sale  of  the  developed  property,  transfer  the 
hazard  to  the  unsuspecting  buyer. 

Theoretical  calculations  as  well  as  experience  have 
shown  that  the  seismic  risk  to  life  is  usually  minimum 
in  one  story  wood  frame  dwelling  structures.  Total 
collapse  very  rarely  occurs  even  when  these  dwellings 
are  tossed  about  like  boats  on  an  open  sea.  Classic 
examples  of  the  inherent  strength  of  conventional 
wood  frame  dwellings  could  be  found  in  the  Turn- 
again  Heights  section  of  Anchorage  after  the  1964 
earthquake;  wood  frame  dwellings  formerly  on  level 
ground  were  found  at  30  degrees  and  greater  slopes 
and  were  often  salvageable.  This  is  not  to  say  that 
structures  of  other  materials  cannot  and  have  not  per- 
formed equally  well,  but  an  equal  degree  of  safety 
requires  considerable  additional  cost  and  engineering 
know-how.

Another  aspect  of  life  safety  is  egress  from  a  heavily 
shaken  structure.  Panic  during  and  following  an  earth- 
quake can  become  a  serious  hazard  in  a  multistory 
structure  housing  many  people.  When  damage  occurs 
to  multistory  structures,  it  commonly  occurs  to  the 
stairs,  to  walls  around  the  stairs,  and  to  elevators  and 
their  walls.  Debris  falling  on  the  stairs  is  a  significant 
life  hazard.  The  degree  of  seismic  risk  from  panic 
conditions  will  increase  as  a  function  of  the  number 
of  stories  and  the  occupant  load. 

One  story  industrial  and  commercial  structures 
often  have  concrete  or  masonry  exterior  walls  and 
wood  roofs.  In  order  to  achieve  a  minimum  seismic 
risk  to  life,  these  types  of  structures  must  be  excep- 
tionally well  tied  together  when  located  on  bay  fills. 
Unfortunately,  American  building  codes  do  not  re- 
quire special  earthquake  design  factors  for  buildings 
on  poor  soils. 

In  summary,  the  increased  seismic  risk  to  life  in 
structures  located  on  bay  fills  can  be  reduced  by  the 
use  of  light  mass  structures  such  as  single  family  one 
story  wood  frame  dwellings.  The  use  of  specially 
interconnected  footings  can  also  minimize  the  life  and 
property  risk.  Industrial  and  commercial  structures 
have  least  life  risk  when  they  are  of  one  story  and  of 
judiciously  selected  structural  designs  and  materials. 
Requirements  to  control  property  damage  are  more 
severe  than  those  for  life  safety.  It  is  desirable  to  keep 
the  population  density  to  low  figures,  and  consider- 
able thought  should  be  given  to  the  increased  risk 
before  allowing  the  construction  of  high  rise  struc- 
tures, auditoriums,  and  similar  structures  in  poorest 
ground  areas.  It  should  also  be  mentioned  that  bay 
fills  are  not  the  only  geologic  hazard  to  construction; 
landslide  areas  and  fault  zones  are  additional  major 
hazards. 

FIRE  FOLLOWING  EARTHQUAKE 

Fire  following  an  earthquake  is  a  distinct  hazard. 
However,  fire  is  a  substantially  greater  seismic  risk  to 
property  than  to  life.  Water  systems  necessary  to 
fight  fires  have  often  been  crippled  or  have  failed  in 
earthquakes,  particularly  in  the  poor  ground  areas 
described  in  the  previous  paragraphs.  The  reasons 
for  this  intensified  water  system  damage  are  largely 
traceable  to  differential  settlements  and  to  ground 
lurching  in  a  horizontal  direction.  Additionally, 
earthquake  induced  water  surges  in  pipelines  have 
been  the  probable  cause  of  leaks  where  the  lines  have 
been  significantly  weakened  by  corrosion  and  other 
pre-earthquake  causes.  Water  and  gas  pipelines  enter- 
ing buildings  have  often  been  broken  due  to  earth- 
quake induced  building  settlements,  or  due  to  a  build- 
ing rocking  back  and  forth  on  soft  compressible  soils 
during  the  earthquake.  The  foregoing  problems  can 
be  readily  solved  at  virtually  no  cost  by  special  atten- 
tion to  design  details. 

All  power,  water  and  gas  systems  entering  bay  fills 
should  be  designed  so  they  can  be  isolated  within 
sections  of  the  district,  and  within  the  entire  district, 
in  an  earthquake  emergency.  This  calls  for  coordinated 
planning  between  the  fire  department  and  water  and 
gas  utilities  prior  to  construction.  This  planning 
should  be  followed  by  the  development  of  an  earth-

quake  operational  procedure  checked  out  at  least  one 
a  year  by  the  fire  department.  This  latter  aspect  cai 
be  easily  forgotten  with  time,  and  thereby  negate 
good  fire  protection  system. 

A  second  line  of  defense  for  large  development 
or  for  fire  hazardous  industrial  and  commercial  devel 
opments,  or  for  complex  piping  and  valving  system 
is  a  special  and  independent  water  system  solely  fo 
fire  protection  use  and  which  makes  use  of  wate 
pumped  from  the  bay.  The  City  of  San  Francisco  ha 
such  a  system. 

Fuel  oil  and  other  flammable  liquids  stored  in  larg 
diameter  tanks  have  suffered  damage,  and  extensiv 
fires  have  sometimes  resulted  during  large  earthquake 
However,  the  spectacular  and  destructive  oil  fires  ; 
Seward,  Valdez,  Whittier  and  Crescent  City  in  th 
1964  Alaskan  earthquake  were  principally  the  resu 
of  the  seismic  sea  wave  which  destroyed  the  tanl 
and  distributed  the  oil  over  large  areas.  Significant!; 
damage  to  oil  storage  tanks  at  a  number  of  locatior 
in  Anchorage  did  not  result  in  fire;  the  seismic  se 
wave  did  not  affect  Anchorage.  The  1952  Kei 
County  earthquake,  with  its  thousands  of  oil  tanks  i 
the  heavily  shaken  area,  had  no  oil  fires  and  ver' 
little  oil  loss.  The  Kern  County  tanks,  of  course,  wei 
subjected  only  to  ground  vibrations  and  not  to  forct 
from  a  seismic  sea  wave. 

Oil  loss  can  come  from  tank  shell  failure  as  a  res 
of  vibratory  ground  forces,  or  from  pipe  breaks

ping  entering  tanks,  or  from  failure  of  the  support- 
i?  bay  fills,  or  from  a  combination  of  these  factors. 
lie  first  two  factors  can  be  overcome  by  reasonably 
Wl  established  design  methods  and  without  signifi- 
es costs,  and  the  customary  diking  system  will  act 
a  a  second  line  of  defense.  The  problem  becomes 
aite  on  bay  fills  if  the  fill  should  fail.  The  dikes  also 
a  likely  to  fail,  as  an  accompaniment  of  any  major 
S'l  failure  beneath  the  tanks.  Fire  would  not  neces- 
sary follow  if  no  source  of  ignition  were  present. 


While  there  is  an  increased  earthquake  risk  from 
flammable  storage  located  in  tanks  on  bay  fills,  a  judi- 
ciously located  tank  farm  well  isolated  from  other 
developments  and  in  an  area  where  any  escaping  flam- 
mable liquids  would  not  be  carried  far  by  tidal  cur- 
rents or  by  prevailing  winds  could  be  developed  with- 
out increasing  the  fire  hazard  to  adjoining  areas. 
Further  minimization  of  the  risk  could  be  obtained 
if  the  tanks  were  placed  on  a  firm  foundation,  pref- 
erably piling.  It  would  seem  that  only  a  small  portion 
of  the  bay  could  be  suitable  for  this  type  of  develop- 
ment. 

POLICING 

It  has  been  mentioned  in  previous  paragraphs  that 
the  science  and  profession  of  soils  engineering  for 
earthquake  forces  has  come  of  age  in  recent  years, 
but  major  developments  are  still  to  be  expected.  Their 
leading  practitioners  in  the  San  Francisco  Bay  area 
are  among  the  world  leaders,  and  their  judgment  and 
experience  are  of  the  highest  order. 

The  number  of  local  firms  in  the  field  of  soils  engi- 
neering has  substantially  increased  in  recent  years,  and 
is  still  increasing.  It  is  conceivable  for  a  land  developer 
to  shop  for  his  experts  and  to  find  one  who  will  ap- 
prove or  recommend  procedures  involving  judgment- 
evaluated  risk  that  the  large  majority  of  the  other 
practitioners  would  question.  Admittedly,  all  profes- 
sions require  a  substantial  amount  of  judgment,  and 
differences  of  opinion  are  to  be  expected  among  com- 
petent professionals. 

Life  safety  in  buildings  is  subject  to  a  set  of  checks 
and  balances  in  the  form  of  minimum  standards  found 
in  building  codes  which  are  enforced  by  local  build- 
ing officials.  This  set  of  checks  and  balances  is  effec- 
tive to  one  degree  or  another,  and  includes  the  con- 
crete foundations  to  the  roof.  However,  the  usual 
building  department  is  not  staffed  to  review  the  soil 
engineer's  report.  Further,  the  state  of  the  art  of  soil 
response  to  seismic  forces  appears  to  be  such  that  no 
generally  accepted  set  of  minimum  standards  exists. 
Quite  possibly  the  best  set  of  criteria  of  what  should 
be  expected  in  a  soils  engineer's  report  may  be  found 
in  "San  Francisco  Bay  Area  Rapid  Transit  District, 
Soil  Investigations,"  Report  of  Interim  Soil  Mechanics 
Advisory  Committee  to  Parsons  Brinkerhoff — Tudor- 
Bechtel,  July  1,  1963. 

It  seems,  therefore,  that  the  higher  risk  to  buildings 
on  bay  fills  receives  less  "check  and  balance"  atten- 
tion than  do  the  superstructures.  It  is  a  fair  question 
to  ask  if  this  area  should  not  receive  more  supervision 
from  the  building  departments. 

SUMMARY  AND  CONCLUSIONS 

Earthquakes  strong  enough  to  cause  damage  have 
occurred  about  12  times  per  century  in  the  San  Fran- 
cisco Bay  area.  The  past  history  of  these  earthquakes 
shows  no  predictable  pattern  as  to  time,  strength  or 
location.  Large  earthquakes  have  occurred  five  times 
in  the  Bay  area  since  1836,  the  latest  in  1906.  Meas- 
ured accumulating  strains  in  the  earth's  crust  indicate 
the  inevitablility  of  future  earthquakes  in  this  area. 
At  present,  earthquakes  cannot  be  predicted  as  to  time, 
place,  or  severity.  However,  based  on  all  available  evi-

dence,  it  is  reasonable  to  expect  a  large  earthquake 
in  the  San  Francisco  Bay  area  once  in  every  60  to 
100  years.  These  figures  should  be  used  as  a  basis  for 
planning,  and  not  for  predicting.  This  frequency  is 
sufficient  to  require  that  all  structures  and  bay  fills 
be  designed  to  resist  the  forces  of  a  great  earthquake. 
The  historical  record  of  large  earthquakes  in  the 
San  Francisco  Bay  area  certainly  shows  a  greater  seis- 
mic risk  on  bay  fills  than  on  firmer  soils  or  on  rock. 
However,  a  reading  of  this  record  clearly  indicates 
the  structurally  incompetent  nature  of  the  soils  in- 
volved in  the  examples  of  accentuated  damage  on  bay 
fills.  It  also  points  out  that  some  buildings  survived 
excellently,  particularly  those  on  piling.  The  historic 
record  is  vitally  important,  but  it  must  not  be  extrap- 
olated to  different  soil  conditions  without  careful 
engineering  analysis  and  judgment. 

Fills  constructed  by  present-day  methods  on  com- 
pressible bay  soils  (including  "bay  mud")  are  quite 
different  from  those  which  are  discussed  in  the  his- 
toric earthquake  record.  Experience  with  the  per- 
formance of  these  modern  fills  under  seismic  con- 
ditions is  very  small.  However,  this  experience 
plus  experience  from  non-bay  fills  certainly  shows  that 
modern  well  compacted  engineering  fills  perform 
much  better  than  did  the  uncontrolled  fills  of  recorded 
earthquake  history. 

Our  knowledge  of  the  seismic  behavior  of  soils  is 
rapidly  increasing,  but  judgment  still  must  play  a 
very  important  part.  The  fact  that  rapid  progress  is 
being  made  in  the  understanding  of  these  unknowns, 
however,  leaves  many  structural  and  civil  engineers 
with  not  as  comfortable  a  feeling  as  might  be  wished 
since  future  developments  may  raise  questions  regard- 
ing the  safety  of  present  construction.  Unfortunately, 
a  conservative  approach  usually  involves  greater  costs. 

Settlement  of  bay  fills,  especially  differential  settle- 
ments, can  seriously  weaken  a  building  prior  to  a 
shock.  This  allows  earthquake  forces  to  more  readily 
damage  the  weakened  structure.  The  control  of  differ- 
ential settlements  in  a  bay  fill  is  a  function  of  eco- 
nomics in: 

a.  The  construction  of  the  fill,  and 

b.  The  construction  of  buildings  on  the  fill. 

Steps  to  reduce  differential  settlements,  such  as  the 
replacement  of  the  poorest  soils  by  engineered  fills, 
surcharge  loadings  for  long  time  periods  to  accelerate 
compaction  and  settlement  prior  to  building  construc- 
tion, as  well  as  other  methods  can  significantly  raise 
the  cost  of  land  development.  There  is  a  natural  tend- 
ency for  a  land  developer  to  save  money  and,  possibly 
in  some  cases,  to  select  a  soils  consultant  who  will  give 
him  the  cheapest  solution. 

The  design  of  a  building  on  filled  land  also  involves 
economic  factors  of  seismic  risk  because  the  building 
must  have  special  features  to  accommodate  the  an- 
ticipated differential  settlements.  This  may  be  done 
by  piling,  large  mat  footings,  heavily  interconnected 
spread  footings,  special  beam  to  column  connections, 
and  the  like.  The  foundation  designs  for  major  struc- 
tures are  often  quite  sophisticated  as  well  as  expensive. 


Economic  pressures  may  exist  to  allow  some  degr&lt; 
of  differential  settlements  within  a  structure  at  tl 
possible  cost  of  decreased  safety  factors. 

Building  codes  are  intended  to  establish  minimui 
(not  maximum)  standards  of  safety.  A  building  th 
just  meets  all  of  the  minimum  standards  of  a  buildir 
code  is,  in  effect,  on  the  verge  of  being  legally  unsaf 
Policing  for  compliance  with  building  code  requiri 
ments  is  the  province  of  the  local  building  depar 
ments.  However,  it  is  not  customary  for  buildir 
departments  to  have  personnel  qualified  in  soils  eng 
neering  on  their  staffs.  Therefore,  for  any  specif 
project,  the  conclusions  and  recommendations  of  tl 
soils  engineer  rarely  receive  the  same  scrutiny  as  d 
the  drawings  for  constructing  the  building.  With  tl 
large  increase  in  the  number  of  soils  engineering  coi 
sultants,  the  superior  performance  of  past  years  ma 
not  always  be  maintained  in  all  cases.  It  seems  reasoi 
able,  therefore,  to  critically  review  present  practici 
to  see  if  it  is  appropriate  to  recommend  some  ii 
creased  degree  of  policing  of  bay  fills. 

Meanwhile,  a  conservative  approach  is  in  order  t 
compensate  for  a  different  seismic  risk  on  bay  fill

From  the  earthquake  standpoint,  the  use  of  eng 
neered  fills  over  deep  bay  compressible  soils  for  buik 
ing  foundations  must  be  considered  to  be  experiment 
to  some  degree.  Many  answers  regarding  the  degr 
of  increased  seismic  risks  and  methods  to  reduce  it  c; 
be  derived  from  the  records  of  seismic  instrumer 
after  even  moderate  shocks.  In  the  interests  of  loi 
range  land  use  and  planning,  strong  motion  seisrr 
equipment  should   be  installed   and   housed   on   ea&gt; 
major  bay  fill  development  as  well  as  on  other  kin 
of    natural    and    artificial    ground.    Each    installatl 
should  be  coordinated  with  and  become  a  part  of  t 
U.  S.  Coast  and  Geodetic  Survey  network  for  fo 
results.  One  proposal  is  to  install  and  house  these  i 
struments  at  the  expense  of  the  developer,  with  t 
condition  that  the  records  remain  public.  Somewl 
similar  programs  for  buildings  are  already  in  exister.

ommended  for  these  zones  are:

'.one  1:  Minimum  increased  risk  zone: 
All  structures  three  or  more  stories  in  height  shall 
have  a  structural  engineer  of  record  who,  upon 
completion  of  the  construction  and  before  occu- 
pancy, will  file  a  statement  with  the  local  building 
department  that  he  or  a  structural  engineer  on  his 
staff,  has  knowledge  that  the  structural  engineering 
aspects  of  the  plans  and  specifications  have  been 
complied  with  during  construction.  (Precedence 
for  this  exists  in  California  public  school  construc- 
tion. An  undivided  responsibility  for  a  building's 
structural  integrity  will  lead  to  better  construction 
and  compensate  for  the  increased  risk.) 

one  2:  Moderate  increased  risk  zone: 
All  requirements  of  Zone  1,  plus  the  following: 
Single  family  and  multiple  family  occupancies  shall 
be  limited  to  two  story  wood  frame  construction. 
Other  occupancies  shall  be  no  higher  than  one  story 
^plus  mezzanine. 

A  structural  engineer  of  record  is  required  for  all 
buildings  having  concrete,  brick,  and/or  hollow 
concrete  block  walls  in  which  these  walls  constitute 
more  than  25  percent  of  the  total  exterior  wall  area. 
No  city  halls,  hospitals,  or  places  of  detention  are 
allowed  in  this  zone. 

one  3:  Substantially  increased  risk  zone: 
All  requirements  of  Zone  2,  plus  the  following: 
Occupancies  shall  be  limited  to  warehouses,  storage 
areas,  and  similar  minimum  population  density  oc- 
cupancies. Offices  shall  be  only  those  necessary  to 
facilitate  these  occupancies.  Dwellings  are  not  per- 
mitted. 


Structures  shall  be  one  story  in  height. 
Only  public  buildings  which  are  necessary  to  serv- 
ice the   area  are  allowed.   Fire  stations  could   be 
placed  in  this  zone  if  mandatory  from  other  con- 
siderations. 

7.one  4:  Maximum  increased  risk  zone: 

Parks,  golf  courses,  and  similar  land  use  is  permitted. 
Appurtenant  structures  (such  as  storage  sheds)  are 
permitted  if  of  one  story  wood  frame  construction. 
(This  zone  could  include  former  refuse  dump 
areas.) 

Zone  1  may  constitute  most  of  the  developable  land, 
depending  on  how  much  land  is  set  aside  and  the  engi- 
neering qualities  of  the  land.  Special  provisions  for 
waivers  must  be  incorporated  into  any  rules;  obvi- 
ously, even  in  Zone  4  it  would  be  possible  (but  not 
necessarily  economical)  to  put  in  special  foundations 
capable  of  overcoming  site  deficiencies. 

Technical  and  detailed  specifications  involving  sev- 
eral disciplines  will  have  to  be  established  in  order  to 
equitably  zone  the  bay  and  to  further  implement  the 
foregoing.  Guidelines  for  differential  settlements  may 
be  established  if  feasible.  Existing  soil  data  will  have 
to  be  evaluated  for  each  zone.  Criteria  for  the  loca- 
tions of  seismic  instruments  are  required.  Minimum 
standards  for  soil  reports  and  the  policing  of  engi- 
neered fills  will  have  to  be  considered.  Detailed  stand- 
ards for  special  risks  such  as  oil  storage  tanks  will 
have  to  be  developed. 

The  scientific  and  technical  implementation  aspects 
of  the  foregoing  should  be  the  work  of  a  professional 
group  and  not  that  of  an  individual  since  judgment 
plays  such  an  important  part.

THE  SAFETY  OF  FILLS 


* 


By  Board  of  Consultants,  Bay  Conservation  and  Development  Commission 


INTRODUCTION 

On  February  16,  1968,  the  San  Francisco  Bay  Con- 
servation and  Development  Commission  (BCDC)  ap- 
pointed a  Board  of  Consultants  to  Review  Safety  of 
Proposed  Fills.  As  a  first  step,  this  Board  of  Consult- 
ants began  the  study  of  the  criteria  which  would  be 
necessary  to  establish  a  satisfactory  level  of  safety  in 
a  field  where  no  generally  accepted  standards  cur- 
rently exist. 

It  must  be  expected  that  the  San  Francisco  area  will 
be  subjected  to  damaging  earthquakes  during  the  use- 
ful life  of  all  major  developments.  Since  the  time  and 
severity  of  future  earthquakes  cannot  be  predicted 
with  any  degree  of  precision,  it  is  recommended  that 
the  design  of  all  major  facilities  give  appropriate  con- 
sideration to  the  occurrence  of  a  major  earthquake. 

Considering  San  Francisco  Bay  as  a  whole,  the  kinds 
of  earthquake  phenomena  that  can  cause  damage  are 
listed  below,  generally  according  to  degree  of  hazard: 

1.  Shaking  of  the  ground.  This  is  placed  first  be- 
cause, although  to  varying  degree,  all  bay  fill  areas 
will  be  subjected  to  amplification  of  ground  motion. 

2.  Ground  failure.  Compaction,  liquefaction,  lurch- 
ing, slides,  etc. 

3.  Inundation.     Seiches  and  tsunamis. 

4.  Surface  faulting.  Probably  a  significant  potential 
hazard  at  only  a  few  localities. 

Actually,  the  order  could  vary  widely  from  place  to 
place,  and  would  also  be  influenced  by  intended  use 
of  the  site  in  question. 

It  must  be  recognized  that  it  is  not  economically 
or  practically  feasible  to  design  all  structures  to  pre- 
clude the  occurrence  of  damage  in  the  central  region 
of  major  earthquakes.  The  intent  of  the  design,  there- 
fore, should  be  to  provide  for  a  major  earthquake  in 
such  a  fashion  that  structures  would  not  be  expected 
to  collapse  and  endanger  the  life  and  safety  of  people 
— even  though  fairly  substantial  property  damage  might 
occur.  In  some  instances,  it  may  be  advisable  for  the 
designers  to  indicate  the  provisions  which  they  believe 
appropriate  for  a  more  normal  design  earthquake  and 
to  indicate  the  extent  of  damage  which  they  would 
expect  to  be  acceptable  for  this  type  of  earthquake. 


The  present  state  of  the  art  of  engineering  bay  fills 
and  structures  thereon  requires,  in  many  cases,  the  best 
scientific  and  professional  judgment  of  geologists,  soils 
engineers,  structural  engineers,  and  architects  in  order 
to  assure  reasonable  standards  of  safety.  This  need  for 
the  highest  engineering  and  scientific  competence  can 
not  be  overemphasized,  and  there  is  no  public  assur- 
ance that  it  exists  for  every  development. 

At  present,  local  governments  do  not  take  an  active 
role  in  these  special  technical  problems,  largely  be- 
cause of  economic  reasons  relating  to  adequate  staffing. 
It  does  not  appear  that  this  situation  will  substantially 
change  in  the  near  future. 

Therefore,  in  any  plan  for  the  conservation  and 
development  of  the  bay,  the  BCDC  Board  of  Consult- 
ants feels  that  reasonable  and  adequate  safety  criteria 
must  be  developed  and  be  enforceable.  This  report  is 
the  product  of  the  safety  criteria  studies  made  by  the 
BCDC  Board  of  Consultants.  It  is  hoped  that  the  re- 
port will  provide  an  initial  set  of  criteria  for  a  succes- 
sor board,  which  could  begin  with  this  document  and 
refine  it  further  as  new  information  becomes  available 
to  it. 

This  report  deals  with  the  safety  of  fills  in  the  area 
of  San  Francisco  Bay  as  defined  in  the  McAteer-Petris 
Act,  1965,  that  established  the  San  Francisco  Bay  Con- 
servation and  Development  Commission.  The  Act  de- 
fines San  Francisco  Bay  as  the  shoals  outside  the 
Golden  Gate,  the  water  areas  of  San  Francisco,  San 
Pablo  and  Suisun  Bays,  including  marshlands,  tidelands 
and  submerged  lands  as  far  east  as  the  Sacramento 
River  line,  but  excluding  all  lands  that  are  not  subject 
to  tidal  action.  Although  geologic  situations  in  other 
parts  of  San  Francisco  Bay  area  and  in  parts  of  other 
major  urban  areas  of  the  West  Coast  pose  problems 
of  building  safe  structures,  it  is  not  the  purpose  of  this 
report  to  compare  problems  of  safe  bay  fills  with 
problems  of  safe  construction  in  other  areas. 

In  developing  criteria  to  control  the  development 
of  San  Francisco  Bay  front  and  reclaimed  tideland 
areas,  it  is  recommended  that  the  following  reasoning 
be  accepted  as  a  guide  for  the  future  safety  of  such 
developments,  including  the  effects  of  earthquakes.

The  construction  of  buildings  on  fills  overlying  bay 
deposits  or  comparably  weak  natural  soil  deposits  in- 
volves a  greater  number  of  potential  hazards  than  con- 
struction on  rock  or  dense  hard  soil  deposits.  On  the 
latter  type  of  materials  in  areas  away  from  a  fault 
trace,  the  only  hazard  resulting  from  an  earthquake 
is  likely  to  be  the  shaking  induced  by  the  ground 
motions.  On  the  other  hand,  for  earth  fills  over  bay 
deposits  or  other  natural  weak  soils,  major  hazards  to 
be  considered  in  addition  to  ground  shaking  include 
subsidence  and  settlement  due  to  consolidation  or  com- 
paction, landslides  due  to  various  possible  causes,  and 
liquefaction.  Hazards  due  to  displacement  along  a 
fault  or  due  to  inundating  as  a  result  of  seiches  or 
tsunamis  exist  regardless  of  material.  However,  the 
existence  of  potential  hazards  does  not  mean  that  ade- 
quate design  measures  cannot  be  taken  to  reduce  their 
significance  to  acceptable  proportions.  In  the  case  of 
bay  fills  at  the  present  state  of  technology,  successful 
application  of  such  measures  is  likely  to  be  more  diffi- 
cult in  the  prevention  of  landslides  than  in  minimizing 
the  possibility  of  liquefaction  in  new  fills,  or  of  the 
effects  of  subsidence.  Special  care,  therefore,  is  re- 
quired in  evaluating  landslide  possibilities. 

There  is  a  wide  range  of  hazards  and  risks  to  life 
and  property  on  bay  fills.  These  hazards  vary  with  the 
different  geologic  and  foundation  conditions,  the  use 
of  the  areas  to  be  created,  and  the  type  of  structures 
to  be  constructed  on  these  areas.  The  recommended 
approach  is  to  classify  these  risks  by  zones  and  occu- 
pancies. The  permitted  occupancies,  the  required  geo- 
logic and  engineering  invesigations,  and  the  type  of 
construction  for  each  zone  is  then  established. 

Geological  and  seismological  considerations  related 
to  construction  on  bay  fills  are  described  in  the  first 
part  of  this  report.  The  details  of  the  required  geo- 
logic and  soils  investigations  are  set  forth  in  the  second 
part.  The  third  part  relates  the  type  of  such  investi- 
gations with  the  risk  zones  and  the  desirable  occu- 
pancies. 

The  structural  system  employed  for  any  proposed 
building  should  be  designed  in  accordance  with  estab- 
lished principles  of  mechanics  and  structural  design. 
It  should  survive  the  test  of  rational  analysis,  taking 
into  consideration  all  forces,  both  vertical  and  hori- 
zontal, including  both  uniform  and  differential  settle- 
ment, and  building  and  ground  motion  response. 

GEOLOGICAL  AND  SEISMOLOGICAL  CONSIDERATIONS 
Record  of  Effects  of  Historic  Earthquakes 

It  is  clear  from  the  record  of  historic  earthquakes 
that  the  potential  for  damaging  effects  to  man-made 
structures  is  greatest  in  areas  underlain  by  wet,  geo- 
logically young,  unconsolidated  sediments  (San  Fran- 
cisco, 1906;  Tokyo,  1923;  Long  Beach,  1933;  Fukui, 
1948;  Arvin-Tehachapi,  1952;  Chile,  1960;  Alaska, 
1964;  and  Niigata,  1964). 

Phenomena  associated  with  historic  earthquakes  that 
seem  particularly  pertinent  to  development  of  criteria 
for  acceptably  safe  bay  fill  developments  are  discussed 
below. 


Stability  of  Embankments 

Generally,  the  record  of  the  stability  of  embank- 
ments on  wet,  water-laid,  geologically  young  uncon- 
solidated sediments  is  not  good.  In  past  earthquakes, 
it  has  been  common  for  embankments  to  fail  by  set- 
tling (as  much  as  several  feet)  into  the  underlying 
sediments  and  by  ground  cracking.  Cracks  occur  not 
only  in  the  embankment  more  or  less  parallel  with  its 
longitudinal  axis,  but  also  in  a  zone  as  much  as  sev- 
eral tens  of  feet  wide,  adjacent  to  the  embankment. ! 
Following  are  a  few  examples  of  failure: 

1906  Earthquake 

J.  H.  Wallace,  H.  C.  Phillips,  R.  M.  Drake,  and 
E.  M.  Boggs  in  the  "Report  of  Committee  on  the 
effect  of  the  earthquake  on  railway  embankments", 

American  Society  of  Civil  Engineers,  Proc.  Vol.  33, 
state: 

"Embankments  across  marshes,  or  with  soft  strata  under- 
lying them,  settled  more  or  less.  In  some  cases  the  settlement 
was  vertical;  in  other  cases  there  was  considerable  horizontal 
with  the  vertical  movement. 

"At  one  point  on  the  marsh  between  Benicia  and  Suisun 
on  the  Southern  Pacific,  the  settlement  was  11  ft.;  at  another 
point,  5  ft.   These  were   nearly   vertical. 

"Between  Niles  and  San  Jose,  on  the  Southern  Pacific,  there 
was  at  one  point  a  displacement  of  3  ft.  horizontal,  but  the 
vertical  displacement  was  only  6  in. 

"On  the  North  Shore,  about  2  miles  north  of  Point  Reyes, 
the  road,  originally,  had  been  constructed  with  pile  trestles 
across  several  arms  of  Tomales  Bay;  these  trestles  had  been 
filled  about  15  years  ago,  the  roadbed  being  about  8  ft. 
above  ordinary  high  tide.  Two  of  these  embankments,  2,200 
ft.  and  900  ft.  long,  respectively,  sank  until  the  water  at  high 
tide  washed  over  the  rails. 

"Settlements  of  this  character,  and  of  more  or  less  severity, 
were  common  on  all  railroads  operating  about  the  Bay  of 
San  Francisco  and  its  tributaries." 

Fukui  Earthquake,  1948 

In  "Vol.  II,  Engineering"  of  the  report,  "The  Fukui 
Earthquake,  Hokuriku  Region,  Japan,  June  28,  1948," 
it  is  stated  that  "Damage  to  railroad  embankments 
was  substantial  where  they  crossed  soft  ground.  They 
suffered  subsidence,  upheaval  and  Assuring." 

Alaska  Earthquake,  1964 

McCulloch  and  Bonilla  state  in  their  report,  "Rail- 
road Damage  in  the  Alaska  Earthquake,"  in  the  Sep- 
tember 1967  issue  of  the  Journal  of  the  Soil  Mechanics 
and  Foundations  Division  Proceedings  of  ASCE: 

"Damage  was  also  caused  by  a  loss  in  the  bearing  strength 
of  unconsolidated  sediments,  which  allowed  vertical  settling 
of  the  railroad  embankment.  In  some  areas  the  whole  em- 
bankment settled  irregularly  from  about  2  ft.  to  6  ft.  into  the 
underlying  sediments.  Comparison  of  design  profiles  with  post- 
quake  profiles  across  the  embankment  suggests  that  there  was 
minor  spreading  of  the  embankment  fill,  but  that  most  of  the 
lowering  was  due  to  a  downward  movement  into  the  under- 
lying sediment." 

Lurching,  Etc. 

Lurching,  slumping,  landspreading  toward  a  free 
face    and    associated    cracks    are    characteristic    phe-

lomena  in  water-saturated  sediments  in  all  earthquakes 
arge  enough  to  induce  significant  ground  motion  (San 
Francisco,  1906,  M  =  8!4;  Hebgen  Lake,  Mont.,  1959, 
VI  =  7.1;  Alaska,  1964,  M  =  8.4).  As  well  as  opening 
)f  cracks  in  the  ground,  vertical  displacement  along 
:racks  as  much  as  a  few  feet  may  also  occur.  Follow- 
ng  are  two  examples  of  these  phemonena  associated 
vith  the  1906  earthquake.  Both  localities  are  underlain 
&gt;y  fine-grained  sediments. 

Zoyote  Creek 

On  page  281  in  the  report  of  the  California  Earth- 
quake Commission,  it  is  stated: 

"At  the  bridge  over  Coyote  Creek,  on  the  Alviso-Milpitas 
Road,  the  concrete  abutments  were  thrust  inward  toward  each 
other  about  3  feet.  A  pile  driven  in  the  middle  of  the  stream, 
which  had  been  cut  off  below  the  water  level,  was  lifted 
about  2   feet  and    now   rises   above   the   water. 

"About  150  feet  north  of  this  bridge  the  banks  of  the 
stream  cracked,  the  fissures  running  parallel  with  the  channel 
and  the  land  on  the  creek  side  sliding  toward  the  stream    .... 

"In  the  road  running  northward  along  the  west  side  of 
Coyote  Creek  from  the  bridge,  many  large  cracks  opened. 
Five  hundred  feet  north  of  the  bridge  the  cracks  were  2.5 
feet  wide  and  3  feet  deep  when  the  place  was  visited  April 
26.  Farther  north  the  cracks  were  very  abundant,  mostly  par- 
allel with  the  road,  and  some  were  4  feet  deep  and  3  feet 
wide.  A  quarter  of  a  mile  north  of  the  bridge,  the  whole 
road  was  shoved  eastward  into  the  channel  of  the  creek,  and 
with  it  a  large  number  of  willows  and  Cottonwood  trees  that 
grew  along  the  banks.  Just  south  of  this  place  the  road  was 
broken  up  badly  for  a  distance  of  300  feet.  One  of  the  larg- 
est cracks  in  the  road  was  5  feet  wide,  6  feet  deep,  and 
more  than  100  feet  in  length  ....  For  the  most  part  the 
principal  features  were  approximately  parallel  with  Coyote 
Creek." 

omales  Bay 
Similar  shifting  of  sediments  took  place  in  Tomales 
Jay.  On  page  79  of  the  report  of  the  California  Earth- 
|uake  Commission,  it  is  stated: 

"There  was  also  a  horizontal  shifting  of  mud  over  a  con- 
siderable area.  Residents  familiar  with  depths  of  water  in  the 
vicinity  of  Inverness  stated  that  the  earthquake  caused  a  de- 
cided shoaling  along  the  coast,  but  that  the  relation  of  water 
levels  to  firm  ground  was  unchanged.  It  was  also  stated  that 
a  channel  which  had  existed  parallel  to  the  west  shore  of 
the  bay,  and  to  which  piers  had  been  run,  was  obliterated 
by  the  earthquake.  The  shoaling  might  have  been  caused 
either  by  an  uplift  of  the  bottom  or  by  shifting  of  the  mud 
of  which  it  is  composed  toward  the  shore." 

ubmarine  Slides 

The  Alaska  earthquake  triggered  numerous  sub- 
queous  slides  along  the  outer  edges  of  thick  prisms 
f  water-saturated  poorly  consolidated  sediments  in 
ords  and  in  some  lakes.  Serious  damage  and  loss  of 
fe  resulted  not  only  from  the  slides  but  also  from 
le  water  waves  generated  by  the  slides  at  localities 
ich  as  Seward,  Portage,  and  Valdez. 

quefaction 

Liquefaction  in  sands  and  other  fine  sediments  (San 
rancisco   1957,  Anchorage   1964,  Niigata   1964)   can 


be  a  very  important  factor  in  causing  damage  from 
foundation  failure  and  landslides. 

Seismic  Sea  Waves  and  Seiches 

Seismic  sea  waves  may  occur  at  great  distances  from 
a  major  earthquake  (Crescent  City,  California,  San 
Francisco  Bay — Alaska  earthquake  1964;  Half  Moon 
Bay,  California — Chile  earthquake  1960). 

Most  of  the  damage  in  San  Francisco  Bay  from  the 
tsunami  generated  by  the  Alaska  earthquake  was  to 
small  boats  and  berthing  facilities  in  Loch  Lomond 
Harbor  in  San  Rafael,  according  to  Spaeth  and  Beik- 
man  in  Coast  &amp;  Geodetic  Survey  Technical  Report 
No.  33.  According  to  tide  gauge  records,  the  tsunami 
arrived  during  falling  tide.  At  the  Presidio,  the  maxi- 
mum rise  was  about  3l/2  feet  above  normal  tide  level 
and  the  maximum  fall,  which  occurred  about  an  hour 
earlier,  was  5  feet  below  normal  tide  level.  Corre- 
sponding rise  and  fall  figures  at  Alameda  were  about 
2  V2  feet  and  about  3.7  feet. 

The  extreme  case  of  a  tsunami  reported  generated 
by  a  California  earthquake  is  that  reported  associated 
with  the  December  21,  1812  earthquake.  According 
to  Senora  Juana  Briones  in  the  report,  "Descriptive 
Catalog  of  Earthquakes  of  the  Pacific  Coast  of  the 
United  States,  1769  to  1928,"  by  Sidney  D.  Townley 
and  Aiaxwell  W.  Allen,  Seis.  Soc.  Amer.  Bull.,  v.  29, 
No.  1,  January  1939,  ".  .  .  the  earthquakes  were  so 
severe  as  to  cause  tidal  waves  which  covered  the 
ground  where  the  plaza  now  is  [San  Francisco]." 

The  matter  has  been  recognized  as  of  great  impor- 
tance and  has  been  the  subject  of  a  detailed  study,  "A 
Review  of  the  Evidence  for  the  Santa  Barbara  Coast 
Tsunami  of  December  1812,"  by  Marine  Advisors  (V. 
J.  Grauzinis,  July  1965).  The  conclusion  was,  "The 
evidence  seems  to  point  to  a  nominal  tsunami,  not 
generally — if  at  all — witnessed  among  coast  residents." 

According  to  Townley  and  Allen,  rising  and  falling 
of  water  in  San  Francisco  Bay  is  reported  to  have  ac- 
companied two  earthquakes  in  1854  and  one  in  1856. 

Tectonic  Displacement 

Regional  tectonic  uplift  and  subsidence  of  several 
to  a  few  tens  of  feet  have  been  associated  with  historic 
earthquakes  such  as  Alaska  1964.  This  kind  of  dis- 
placement has  occurred  in  the  San  Francisco  Bay  area 
in  relatively  recent  geologic  time,  as  shown  by  the 
structural  origin  of  San  Francisco  Bay  and  the  elevated 
marine  terraces  along  the  coast. 

There  is  some  evidence  that  suggests  that  at  least 
parts  of  the  bay  may  have  undergone  vertical  dis- 
placement within  the  time  man  has  occupied  the  shores 
of  the  bay.  Louderback  reports  in  California  Division 
of  Mines  and  Geology,  Bulletin  154,  page  87,  that  ten 
of  the  425  shell  mounds  surveyed  in  1908  under  the 
auspices  of  the  University  of  California  extended  be- 
low present  sea  level.  He  states  that  the  Ellis  Landing 
Mound  in  southern  part  of  Richmond  was  built  on  a 
base  of  firm  gravel,  and  at  the  time  of  the  investiga- 
tion, high  tide  rose  18  feet  above  the  base.  It  is  not 
clear,  however,  to  what  extent  the  relation  of  other 
mounds  to  sea  level  today  are  the  result  of  tectonic 
uplift  and  subsidence  or  compaction  of  weak  soil  be- 
neath a  mound.

Though  the  possibility  of  regional  vertical  displace- 
ment cannot  be  ruled  out,  judging  from  the  sense  of 
movement  within  the  San  Andreas  fault  system  over 
the  recent  geologic  past,  it  is  not  very  likely,  and 
probably  would  not  exceed  1  to  2  feet  at  the  time 
of  the  next  major  movement. 

As  information  becomes  available  from  surveys  now 
under  way,  we  can  expect  to  learn  about  faults  in  the 
elongate  structural  basin  on  San  Francisco  Bay  that 
are  not  known  today.1  The  density  of  faults  within 
the  basin  is  probably  about  the  same  as  in  the  border- 
ing uplands.  Most  of  such  faults,  as  is  also  true  in  the 
uplands,  can  be  expected  to  be  inactive,  and  therefore 
of  no  significant  concern  in  siting  man-made  struc- 
tures. 

No  faulting  in  historic  time  has  been  recognized 
within  San  Francisco  Bay.  However,  active  faults  in 
the  Hayward  and  Calaveras  fault  zones  probably  ex- 
tend northward  across  San  Pablo  Bay,  Carquinez 
Strait,  and  Suisun  Bay. 

Significance  of  the  Historic  Record 
In  making  an  evaluation  of  the  historic  record  of 
damaging  effects  on  man-made  structures  of  the  re- 
sponses of  different  kinds  of  ground  to  seismic  load- 
ing, two  things  must  be  kept  in  mind,  (1)  the  design 
and  construction  of  many  of  the  structures  would  not 
meet  standards  today,  and  (2)  many  of  today's  struc- 
tures have  not  faced  the  test  of  strong  earthquake 
ground  motion.  Nevertheless,  the  record  is  clear  in 
pointing  up  the  kinds  of  problems  involved  in  build- 
ing on  bay  sediments  for  which  engineering  solutions 
must  be  sought.  Furthermore,  we  can  conclude  that 
knowing  how  to  design  structures  for  reasonable 
safety  to  life  and  property  is  not  enough.  We  must 
also  foster  development  of  public  procedures  such  that 
our  knowledge  of  how  to  cope  with  the  problems  of 
building  on  lands  underlain  by  bay  sediments  is  used. 
The  problems  most  difficult  to  cope  with  probably 
are  those  associated  with  ground  failure: 

1.  Areas  are  now  being  developed  for  residential 
and  commercial  uses,  where  the  top  of  the  fill  does 
not  extend  above  high  tide.  Such  areas  are  protected 
by  perimeter  dikes.  The  historic  record  demonstrates 
that  steps  must  be  taken  to  preclude  failure,  either  of 
the  dike  itself  or  of  the  sediments  underlying  the 
dike.  Failure  of  a  dike  at  one  place  can  result  in  flood 
damage  to  a  relatively  large  area. 

Tides  and  ground  subsidence  increase  the  problem 
in  the  southern  part  of  San  Francisco  Bay.  Here  the 
mean  tidal  range  is  greater  than  in  the  north  bay  area. 
For  example,  it  is  9  feet  at  Alviso  and  5.9  feet  at  Point 
San  Pablo.  The  maximum  tidal  range  in  the  two  places 
is  14  feet  and  11  feet,  respectively.  Over  the  period 
1934  to  1967,  subsidence  of  the  land  due  to  ground 
water  withdrawal  increased  from  Dumbarton  Bridge 
southward  to  about  6  feet  at  Alviso. 

2.  Use  of  San  Francisco  Bay  as  a  harbor  for  com- 
merce has  long  been,  and  will  continue  to  be,  the 
keystone  of  the  economic  structure  of  the  bay  area. 
Looking  into  the  future,  to  accommodate  larger  ships

former  marshlands.

now  being  built  and  planned  will  require  deepening 
of  the  shipping  channels  from  time  to  time.  Present 
plans  call  for  deepening  the  main  shipping  channels 
in  the  bay  from  35  to  45  feet.  Unless  proper  measures 
are  taken,  the  potential  for  subaqueous  slides  under 
dynamic  loading  may  increase  as  the  channels  are 
deepened,  and  concomitantly  there  could  be  an  in 
crease  in  the  potential  for  serious  hazard  to  some  bay- 
side  locations  either  directly  from  slides  and/or  pos 
sibly  from  slide-induced  waves.  Also,  subaqueous  slides 
could  cause  serious  damage  to  utility  and  communica 
tion  lines.  However,  the  majority  of  the  channels  t 
be  deepened  are  not  adjacent  to  areas  currently 
planned  for  future  development  by  BCDC. 

3.  The  record  shows  that  the  phenomena  of  lurch- 
ing, slumping,  and  ground  cracking  in  weak,  water- 
saturated  sediments  in  the  vicinity  of  free  faces  is  com- 
mon during  strong  earthquake  loading.  Therefore, 
slopes  must  be  engineered  to  reduce  this  kind  of  haz- 
ard to  an  acceptable  level.  Furthermore,  underground 
utilities  in  the  vicinity  of  free  faces  must  be  engineered 
to  withstand  some  cracking  and  movement  of  the 
ground  toward  the  free  face. 

Seismic  and  Geologic  Parameters 
A  list  of  criteria  that  define  the  natural  environ- 
mental conditions  that  should  be  taken  into  account 
so  that  the  best  scientific  information  and  technical 
judgment  is  utilized  to  avoid  undue  risk  to  life  and 
property,  must  stem  from  our  knowledge  today.  It 
must  be  recognized  that  little  geologic  data  are  avail- 
able for  large  parts  of  the  bay,  its  bordering  marsh- 
lands and  former  marshlands.  Also,  there  are  large 
gaps  in  our  understanding  of  the  earthquake  problem. 
Any  list  of  seismic  and  geologic  parameters  should  be 
revised  from  time  to  time  as  more  data  become  avail- 
able and  our  understanding  and  experience  increase. 
It  is  understood  also  that  any  site  should  be  evaluated 
from  the  standpoint  of  its  area  setting,  and  therefore 
it  may  be  necessary  to  go  beyond  the  boundary  of  a 
site  to  obtain  needed  information. 


Seismic  Parameters 

1.  The  region  is  a  seismic  one,  with  a  significant 
likelihood  in  a  score  or  so  of  years  of  a  potentially 
damaging  earthquake  or  earthquakes  nearby,  most 
probably  on  the  San  Andreas,  Hayward,  or  Calaveras 
faults. 

2.  Seismic  velocities  of  bedrock  and  various  types 
of  bay  sediments. 

3.  Ground  response.  It  is  well  known  that  differ- 
ent kinds  of  ground  respond  differently  to  seismic 
loading.  The  relation  between  kind  of  ground  and 
kind  of  response  is  not  clearly  known  and  understood. 
However,  estimates  of  probable  response  can  be  made 
but  should  be  used  with  caution  for  design  studies. 
There  are  wide  gaps  in  the  record  of  the  relation  of 
ground  motion  to  earthquake  magnitude  and  depth  of 
focus.  The  ground  motion  associated  with  a  great 
earthquake  (Magnitude  8+  comparable  to  the  1906 
quake  in  the  Bay  area)  has  never  been  recorded  in-j 
strumentally.

3eologic  Parameters 

1.  Depth  to  bedrock  and  configuration  of  the  bed- 
ock  bottom  of  the  bay. 

2.  Nature,  thickness,  and  distribution  of  older  se- 
ruence  of  bay  sediments. 

3.  Configuration  of  top  of  older  sequence  of  bay 
ediments.  This  was  an  irregular  land  surface  with  a 
tream  drainage  pattern  prior  to  inundation  and  depo- 
ition  of  the  bav  mud  sequence  within  the  last  10,000 
o  20,000  years." 

4.  Nature,  thickness,  and  distribution  of  younger 
equence  of  bay  sediments  (bay  mud). 

5.  Presence  or  absence,  thickness  and  extent,  of 
iquefiable  sand  layers  or  lenses,  particularly  within  the 
•ay  mud  sequence.  Special  attention  should  be  given 
o  ascertaining  the  presence  or  absence  of  liquefiable 
and  layers  or  lenses  beneath  locations  for  dikes  and 
tear  free  faces. 

i  6.  Subsurface  exploration  (borings  and  geophysical 
tudies)  should  be  carried  to  depths  and  horizontal 
xtent  adequate  to  make  a  satisfactory  evaluation  of 
he  risk  in  view  of  the  use  intended. 

7.  If  a  fill  lies  across  the  projection  of  a  known 
ctive  fault,  or  along  the  projection  of  a  fault  indi- 
ated  by  offset  of  recent  sediments  as  revealed  by  sub- 
ottom  acoustical  profiling,  and  if,  in  view  of  the 
se  for  which  the  site  is  planned,  an  underlying  active 
ault  could  be  a  significant  hazard,  a  survey  should  be 
ndertaken  to  determine  the  presence  or  absence  of 
ie  fault  across  the  site  being  considered,  and,  based 
in  expected  activity,  its  potential  effect  on  the  site. 

8.  Land  subsidence  at  the  southern  end  of  the  bay 
::  being  studied  by  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey.  It  is 
ie  result  of  ground  water  withdrawal.  The  extent 
:om  1934  to  1967  is  shown  on  the  map  on  p.  23 
f  this  volume.  The  rate  of  subsidence  has  increased  in 
pcent  years.  This  subsidence  can  be  controlled  by  in- 
reasing  the  artesian  head.  Hopefully,  this  will  be 
ccomplished  some  time  in  the  future  by  decrease  in 
round  water  withdrawal  as  water  from  the  State's 
Duth  Bay  Aqueduct  and  the  San  Felipe  project  be- 
Dmes  available  over  Santa  Clara  Valley. 

SOIL  AND  FOUNDATION  ENGINEERING 
CONSIDERATIONS 

Questions  to  Be  Considered  Involving  Geology,  Soil, 
and  Foundation  Engineering 

With  regard  to  site  stability  and  site  behavior,  an 
/aluation  will  be  required  of  all  significant  problems 
)ncerning  geologic  hazards  or  soil  behavior.  The 
&gt;onsor  should  be  prepared  to  describe  appropriate 
eps  which  will  be  taken  to  restrict  the  effects  of  these 
■oblems  to  acceptable  limits.  Specific  problems  to  be 
msidered  would  be: 

atic  Problems 

1.  Subsidence  and  differential  settlement. 
'2.  Landsliding  and  slope  instability. 

Jrthquake  Problems 

1.  Surface  faulting,  ground  rupture,  and  tectonic 
lovements. 

2.  Soil  liquefaction. 


3.  Landsliding  and  slope  instability. 

4.  Soil  settlement  including  differential  settlement. 

5.  Ground  shaking. 

The  extent  of  investigation  and  analysis  should  be 
sufficient  to  define  the  potential  severity  of  each  par- 
ticular type  of  problem,  and  the  margin  of  safety  pro- 
vided in  relation  to  any  particular  problem  should  be 
appropriately  weighted  in  relation  to  the  consequences 
of  any  failure  or  malfunction  considered  possible. 

General  Scope  of  Investigation 
The  investigation  should  include  sufficient  field 
study  and  literature  review  of  the  geology  of  the 
adjacent  areas  to  establish  a  reasonable  correlation  be- 
tween the  conditions  found  on  the  site  and  those 
known  to  exist  in  the  surrounding  areas.  Evidence 
should  be  given  in  the  report  to  show  how  correlation 
was  established.  Methods  used  in  the  investigation 
should  be  accurately  and  adequately  described. 

Borings  should  be  spaced  close  enough  and  should 
extend  deep  enough  to  adequately  define  the  vertical 
and  horizontal  extent  of  the  various  soil  deposits. 
These  deposits  in  turn  should  be  related  to  the  areal 
geology,  with  the  evidence  for  this  relationship 
clearly  stated. 

An  appendix  should  be  prepared  and  either  be  in- 
cluded in  the  report,  or  be  available  upon  request, 
giving  a  detailed  description  of  the  field  exploration. 
This  should  include  (among  other  items)  descriptions 
of  boring  equipment  and  methods,  sampling  equipment 
and  techniques,  the  degree  of  supervision  and  general 
background  of  the  supervisory  personnel,  complete 
boring  logs,  detail  of  all  field  tests,  and  all  other  infor- 
mation that  might  be  pertinent  to  establishing  the  thor- 
oughness of  the  field  investigation.  An  appendix  also 
should  be  prepared  and  either  be  included  in  the  re- 
port, or  be  available  upon  request,  giving  a  detailed 
description  of  all  laboratory  testing.  Testing  equip- 
ment should  be  described  in  sufficient  detail  to  satisfy 
a  knowledgeable  engineer  of  its  adequacy  (unless  ref- 
erence to  some  established  standard  will  suffice).  Test 
methods  also  should  be  described  in  similar  detail.  Spe- 
cial tests  should  be  described  and  their  relevancy  to 
the  project  demonstrated. 

The  report  should  contain  sufficient  data  and  sup- 
porting information  to  allow  any  knowledgeable  engi- 
neer to  evaluate  the  results  presented.  In  particular 
they  should  be  described  in  enough  detail  to  allow  an 
evaluation  both  of  the  validity  of  the  analyses  and 
recommendations,  and  of  the  limits  of  confidence  that 
might  be  applicable  to  them.  Calculations  should  either 
be  included  as  an  appendix,  or  should  be  available 
upon  request. 

The  scope  of  possible  investigations  relative  to 
"Static  Problems"  and  "Earthquake  Problems"  is  dis- 
cussed in  the  succeeding  paragraphs.  The  discussion 
is  not  intended  as  a  specification  which  must  be  rig- 
idly followed  but  rather  as  an  indication  of  the  depth 
to  which  the  problems  should  be  investigated  to  pre- 
pare a  satisfactory  report  for  a  proposed  development 
or  project.

Static  Problems 

Site  Conditions 

In  order  to  properly  evaluate  a  proposed  site  with 
regard  to  problems  which  might  be  encountered  in 
placing  fills  on  soft  bay  mud  or  similar  materials,  it  is 
necessary  to  make  a  thorough  investigation  of  the  his- 
tory of  the  site.  The  investigation  should  be  such  as  to 
determine  the  presence  or  absence  of  visible  or  obliter- 
ated sloughs  and  ditches,  levees  and  previously  filled 
areas;  length  of  time  area  has  been  free  of  tidal  &lt;action; 
whether  or  not  the  area  has  been  cultivated  and  for 
how  long;  the  degree  of  desiccation;  thickness  and 
nature  of  the  so-called  "crust"  and  other  factors  which 
would  influence  the  behavior  of  the  fill  and  improve- 
ments constructed  thereon. 

Subsidence  and  Differential  Settlement 

The  possible  effects  of  long-term  subsidence  (due  to 
lowering  of  the  ground  water)  must  be  considered 
in  the  southern  end  of  the  bay  (see  "Geological  and 
Seismological  Considerations,"  p.  122).  The  final  ele- 
vation of  fills  should  be  adjusted  for  such  subsidence. 

Settlement  studies  for  fills  on  bay  mud  and  other 
soft  foundation  materials  must  give  consideration  to: 
consolidation  of  the  underlying  foundation  materials; 
settlement  within  the  fill  proper;  plastic  flow  of  the 
supporting  foundation  materials;  variations  in  the 
thickness  of  mud  throughout  the  filled  area;  lateral 
movement  of  the  mud  resting  on  sloping  surfaces  of 
firm  material  or  bedrock;  and  the  rate  of  settlement. 
Adequate  studies  are  required  to  determine  the  ex- 
pected differential  settlement  within  the  area  being 
filled  and  differential  settlement  to  be  anticipated 
within  specific  building  sites.  Analyses  may  also  be 
required  to  determine  whether  differential  settlement 
will  occur  between  the  peripheral  portions  of  the  area 
being  filled  and  the  surrounding  areas  and  the  effects 
of  such  differential  settlement.  For  pile  supported 
structures  the  downdrag  created  by  placement  of  fills 
on  compressible  soils  such  as  bay  muds  must  be  thor- 
oughly investigated  to  determine  the  effect  on  pro- 
posed structures. 

The  possible  effects  of  adjacent  construction,  either 
within  the  site  being  investigated  or  future  reasonably 
possible  construction  immediately  outside  the  site, 
should  be  analyzed  in  sufficient  detail  to  ascertain  that 
adverse  conditions  will  not  develop  from  such  con- 
struction. The  possible  variations  in  water  table  ele- 
vation in  the  fill  as  well  as  boundary  water  levels 
require  sufficient  analyses  to  determine  their  influence 
on  the  performance  of  the  fill  relative  to  settlement 
and  other  factors  such  as  bearing  capacity  and  sta- 
bility. It  is  desirable  that  records  of  the  rate  of  settle- 
ment due  to  soil  consolidation  be  obtained  for  bay 
fills,  and  made  available  to  the  public  as  an  aid  to 
ascertaining  the  satisfactory  performance  of  the  fill. 

Bearing  Capacity 

It  is  necessary  to  determine  the  ability  of  the  fill  to 
support  the  loads  which  will  be  imposed  thereon  with 
appropriate  consideration  being  given  to:  the  strength 
of  the  fill  material  and  the  underlying  foundation  ma- 
terials; type  and  depth  of  foundations  to  be  utilized; 


thickness  of  the  fill  material  required  to  reduce  foun- 
dation loads  to  acceptable  proportions;  the  type  of 
loading  anticipated;  and  other  pertinent  factors. 

Stability 

Sufficient  studies  to  demonstrate  the  stability  of  the 
slopes  of  the  fill,  both  exterior  and  interior  (for  canals, 
lagoons  and  ponding  areas),  are  considered  essential. 
These  should  include  consideration  of  such  factors  as 
strength  of  fill  and  foundation  materials,  variations  in 
water  surfaces,  variations  in  moisture  content  and! 
height  of  water  table  in  the  fill  and  the  reasonable 
possibilities  of  future  development  of  dredged  channels 
adjacent  to  the  fill.  In  addition  to  analyzing  the  sta- 
bility of  slopes,  particularly  exterior  ones,  the  need  for 
protection  of  the  slopes  from  wave  action  requires  an 
investigation  to  determine  the  type  of  protection  re- 
quired, and  the  extent,  depth,  and  height  of  the  pro- 
tection relative  to  the  adjacent  water  surface. 

Construction  Considerations 

Since  the  performance  of  fills  placed  on  soft  foun- 
dation materials  is  related  to  the  methods  used  in  con- 
structing the  fill,  it  is  necessary  to  present  a  detailed 
discourse  on  the  proposed  construction  procedures. 
Such  a  discussion  should  include  but  not  be  limited 
to:  a  description  of  the  proposed  treatment  of  the  sur- 
face to  receive  the  fill  including  special  provisions  to 
be  made  for  existing  or  obliterated  waterways,  levees 
and  existing  fills;  type  of  fill  material  to  be  utilized; 
and  proposed  methods  of  placement;  special  measures 
proposed  to  control  within  tolerable  limits  plastic  flow 
of  the  foundation  material  and/or  lateral  movements 
on  sloping  surfaces. 

Earthquake  Problems 

Surface  Faulting,  Ground  Rupture  (Lurching, 
Etc.),  and  Tectonic  Movements 

Reference  information  or  results  of  explorations 
should  be  adequate  to  define  the  locations  of  signifi- 
cant fault  zones  on  the  site  or  close  enough  to  the  site 
to  materially  influence  the  site  stability.  In  the  event 
that  geologic  fault  structures  are  found  to  exist  within 
or  near  the  site,  an  evaluation  should  be  made  of  the 
probability  of  future  activity  on  these  faults  in  relation 
to  other  known  fault  zones  in  the  San  Francisco  Bay 
Area.  In  the  event  that  fault  movement  is  indicated 
as  being  of  such  a  probability  as  to  require  consider-' 
ation  in  the  design  and  development  of  facilities,  an1 
estimate  shall  be  made,  with  appropriate  supporting 
data,  as  to  the  extent  of  movement  which  should  be 
anticipated  for  design  purposes  and  the  estimated 
probability  of  occurrence.  In  the  event  studies  indi- 
cate serious  possibility  of  tectonic  movements  involv- 
ing uplift  or  subsidence  of  large  land  areas,  recommen- 
dations shall  be  made  concerning  the  magnitude  anc 
location  of  such  ground  surface  movements  whicl 
should  be  considered  in  the  design  of  facilities. 

Soil  Liquefaction 

In  all  projects  where  loose  or  medium  dense  sat 
rated  silt  or  sand  strata  exist,  whether  within  the  fil 
in  the  foundation  material,  or  in  backfill  behind  water 
front  bulkheads,  a  careful  appraisal  should  be  mac

f  the  possibility  of  liquefaction  of  the  soil  during 
irthquakes  and  the  possible  consequences  of  such 
quefaction.  For  this  purpose,  previous  experience 
nth  respect  to  soil  liquefaction  during  earthquakes 
liould  be  utilized  to  the  fullest  possible  extent  together 
/ith  appropriate  analytical  techniques.  It  should  be 
scognized  that  broad  generalizations  cannot  be  made 
1  connection  with  liquefaction  phenomena,  and  each 
ase  should  be  evaluated  separately  with  due  consid- 
ration  being  given  to  the  maximum  probable  severity 
f  earthquake  ground  motion,  the  depth  of  the  water 
ible,  and  the  density  and  strength  properties  of  the 
articular  sand  or  silt  deposit.  In  cases  where  liquefac- 
!on  may  develop,  steps  should  be  taken  such  as  the 
se  of  greater  depth  of  soil  above  water  table,  dedi- 
cation of  the  soil,  or  other  measures  to  alleviate  the 
ossibility  of  adverse  behavior. 

andsliding  and  Slope  Instability 
A  complete  evaluation  should  be  made  of  the  possi- 
ility  of  landslides  occurring  due  to: 

1.  Slides  due  to  liquefaction  (in  saturated  cohesion- 
's soils,  or  sand  seams  or  lenses  in  clay  deposits), 

2.  The  driving  forces  exceeding  the  resistance  of 
iturated  fill,  or  foundation  soils,  or 

3.  Surface  slumping  of  cohesive  fill  slopes. 

All  slopes  should  be  conservatively  designed  to  re- 
uce  the  risk  and  consequences  of  landslides  to  accept- 
ble  limits. 

;  Particular  attention  should  be  given  to  evaluate  the 
verall  site  stability  to  assure  that  the  site  can  be  ex- 
ected  to  remain  substantially  intact  during  and  sub- 
:quent  to  the  maximum  credible  earthquake.  Al- 
lough  some  cracking  of  the  ground  and  cracking  of 
avements  might  occur,  it  should  be  expected  that 
lere  would  be  no  large  fissures,  offsets,  or  lateral 
lovements  or  vertical  slide  movements  of  more  than 
few  inches. 

The  evaluations  of  possible  landslides  should  include 
,)nsideration  of  both  perimeter  and  interior  slopes, 
id  the  investigation  should  be  planned  to  adequately 
/aluate  the  probable  presence  or  absence  of  soils 
hich  might  experience  severe  loss  of  strength  or 
quefaction  conditions  during  an  earthquake. 
;  In  evaluating  landslide  potentials,  as  well  as  locations 
f  soil  strata  which  might  be  subject  to  reduction  of 
rength  or  liquefaction  potential,  it  is  recognized  that 
)mplete  certainty  in  the  locations  of  such  strata  and 
the  evaluation  of  behavior  during  an  earthquake  is 
t&gt;t  practically  feasible.  Therefore,  the  studies  should 
!  carried  to  a  degree  of  thoroughness  which  would 
idicate  a  high  order  of  dependability  of  the  overall 
inclusions.  The  recommendations  reached  should  in- 
•ude  an  appropriate  evaluation  of  the  limits  of  confi- 
:nce  which  might  be  expected  based  on  the  extent 
I  studies  made. 

ibsidence  and  Differential  Settlement 

In  addition  to  considering  problems  due  to  subsid- 
&lt;ice,  and  determining  that  the  settlement  within  the 
il  itself  will  be  within  permissible  limits,  an  evaluation 
to  should  be  made  of  the  settlements  likely  to  de- 
vlop  during  an  earthquake  due  to  the  compaction  of 


underlying  foundation  soils.  Such  settlements  may  vary 
from  negligible  amounts  for  clays  to  substantial 
amounts  for  loose  cohesionless  soils.  These  evaluations 
should  include  estimates  of  both  the  expected  general 
areal  settlement  and  the  degree  of  non-uniform  settle- 
ment which  might  be  expected  under  the  effects  of 
earthquake  shaking. 

Intensity,  Duration,  and  Character  of  Ground  Shaking 

After  ensuring  that  all  major  stability  problems  in- 
volving permanent  displacements  of  fill  or  foundation 
materials  have  been  eliminated  or  reduced  to  tolerable 
proportions,  consideration  should  be  given  to  the 
probable  nature  of  the  ground  shaking  to  which  struc- 
tures will  be  subjected.  These  motions  may  not  be 
influenced  significantly  by  foundation  type  (footings, 
piles,  piers,  etc.),  but  they  will  depend  in  large  meas- 
ure on  the  magnitude  of  the  earthquake,  the  epicentral 
distance,  and  the  nature  of  the  entire  soil  deposit  (in- 
cluding any  fill  (overlying  base  rock  at  the  site.  From 
a  knowledge  of  the  soil  conditions  and  the  probable 
magnitude  and  location  of  the  design  earthquake,  it 
is  possible  to  estimate  a  response  spectrum  characteriz- 
ing the  nature  of  the  ground  surface  motions  and  their 
influence  on  structures.  This  is  particularly  necessary 
in  the  case  of  fills  over  deep  layers  of  bay  mud,  since 
the  response  spectrum  for  these  conditions  is  likely  to 
differ  appreciably  from  the  average  spectrum  often 
used  for  civil  engineering  design  purposes.  Buildings 
and  other  facilities  at  the  site  should  then  be  designed 
in  accordance  with  the  changed  response  spectrum  in- 
dicated at  the  site,  in  addition  to  the  static  stresses 
imposed  by  normal  loads  and  the  effects  of  any  an- 
ticipated differential  settlements.  In  general,  since  the 
predominant  period  of  the  ground  motions  is  likely 
to  be  relatively  long  for  areas  underlain  by  thick  layers 
of  bay  mud,  seismic  forces  due  to  shaking  are  likely 
to  be  least  for  short  period  one-story  structures  of 
moderate  floor  area  and  will  be  relatively  larger  for 
multi-story  structures. 

Design  of  Structures  and  Facilities 
Foundations 

Since  the  soil  underlying  a  building  will  be  subjected 
to  some  degree  of  horizontal  and  vertical  displace- 
ments during  an  earthquake,  it  is  desirable  to  minimize 
differential  displacements  at  the  base  of  the  structure 
as  far  as  possible. 

With  regard  to  the  performance  of  pile  foundations 
during  an  earthquake,  there  is  good  evidence  to  show 
that  the  use  of  piles  in  areas  subjected  to  earthquake- 
induced  settlements  often  can  prevent  major  damage 
to  the  buildings.  However,  in  the  design  of  pile  foun- 
dations, the  following  precautions  should  be  observed: 

1.  Presently  available  evidence  indicates  that  the 
presence  of  piles  is  not  likely  to  affect  significantly 
the  nature  of  the  ground  shaking  to  which  a  building 
is  subjected. 

2.  If  piles  are  supported  in  granular  soils  in  which 
settlement  may  be  induced  by  the  ground  shaking, 
settlement  and  possibly  differential  settlement  of  the 
building  foundation  will  result.

3.  If  the  soil  around  a  pile  settles  during  an  earth- 
quake, the  pile  will  be  subjected  to  an  additional 
downward  force  by  the  surrounding  soil. 

4.  Even  if  the  soil  at  the  lower  ends  of  the  piles  pro- 
vides adequate  supporting  capacity,  liquefaction  of  a 
substantial  section  of  loose  cohesionless  soils  above  the 
pile  tips  may  permit  lateral  movement  of  the  pile  caps 
accompanied  by  bending  of  the  piles. 

5.  Vertical  piles  are  not  likely  to  provide  any  sub- 
stantial degree  of  resistance  to  translation  of  a  building 
due  to  lateral  slippage  in  the  underlying  soils. 

Retaining  Walls  and  Basement  Walls 

Retaining  walls  and  basement  walls  should  be  de- 
signed to  withstand  the  seismic  forces  developed  in  the 
backfill  materials  or  the  forces  which  might  be  pro- 
duced as  a  result  of  the  interaction  of  the  structure 
and  the  foundation  soils  in  addition  to  the  usual  static 
lateral  pressures.  It  is  recognized  that  basement  wall 
design  involves  substantial  judgement  based  on  experi- 
ence since  performance  has  been  better  than  present 
theory  might  suggest. 

Utilities 

Special  precautions  should  be  taken  as  appropriate 
in  the  desgn  and  construction  of  utility  systems  to 
provide  sufficient  flexibility  for  the  systems  to  with- 
stand the  expected  ground  movements  during  an  earth- 
quake. Additional  precautions  may  be  advisable  in 
some  cases,  such  as  automatic  shutoff  valves,  to  mini- 
mize hazards  in  the  event  the  system  is  disrupted,  and 
independent  supplemental  water  systems  (or  equiva- 
lent) may  be  called  for. 

Conclusions 
In  view  of  the  many  different  uses  which  may  be 
planned  for  reclaimed  lands  areas  and  the  variations  in 
the  geologic,  soil,  and  foundation  problems  which  re- 
quire consideration,  it  is  not  feasible  to  prescribe  spe- 
cific investigations,  tests,  or  analyses  which  would  be 
appropriate  for  all  of  these  varied  requirements.  The 
objective  of  the  foregoing  discussion,  therefore,  has 
been  directed  toward  outlining  the  nature  of  the  prob- 
lems which  might  require  consideration  in  any  specific 
project.  It  is  believed  that  the  implementation  of  poli- 
cies required  to  answer  these  problems  will  require  the 
formulation  of  a  highly  competent  review  board  which 
will  be  charged  with  the  responsibility  of  evaluating 
the  appropriateness  of  the  specific  investigations  and 
analyses  which  may  be  required  for  any  particular 
project.  The  appropriate  scope  and  extent  of  such  in- 
vestigations and  studies  should  be  sufficient  to  enable 
the  knowledgeable  professional  engineers,  geologists, 
and  other  specialists  on  the  Board  of  Review  to  as- 
certain that  the  severity  of  each  particular  type  of 
problem  has  been  reasonably  evaluated,  and  the  mar- 
gins of  safety  provided  are  appropriate  in  relation  to 
the  consequences  of  occurrence  of  the  particular  prob- 
lem under  consideration.  It  is  expected  that,  as  work 
is  carried  on  under  this  program,  there  will  develop 
a  sound  body  of  information  concerning  investigative 
and  design  and  construction  procedures  which  will 
enable  desirable  projects  to  be  carried  out  with  an 
optimum  balance  between  the  factors  of  cost,  risk,  and 


function,  and  that  this  can  be  accomplished  while  en- 
couraging a  continued  improvement  in  the  "state  of 
the  art"  regarding  application  of  technical  knowledge 
to  advantageous  use  of  the  properties  concerned. 

ENGINEERING  SAFETY  REQUIREMENTS 

The  following  is  presented  in  qualitative,  not  quan- 
titative, form  to  give  a  general  summary  indication  of 
the  type  and  scope  of  the  occupancy,  the  required 
scope  of  investigation,  and  construction  requirements 
for  each  risk  zone.  The  details  and  lines  of  demarcation 
should  have  an  intensive  review  and  further  study  by 
a  highly  qualified  group  such  as  the  proposed  future 
Fill  Review  Board. 

The  four  risk  zones  will  first  be  defined,  based  on 
various  foundation  and  geological  conditions.  Typical 
occupancies  and  structure  types  to  be  expected  in 
each  zone  are  outlined,  together  with  the  foundation 
and  geological  investigation  required  for  these  typical 
uses  (Table  1).  It  is  usually  possible  in  each  zone  under 
special  conditions  to  construct  a  building  with  either 
normally  higher  risk  occupancies  or  of  normally 
higher  risk  types  of  construction,  but  then  additional 
investigation  is  required  and  special  construction  pre- 
cautions must  be  observed  (Table  2). 

Risk  Zones 
Zone  I — Minimum  Risk 

This  zone  would  comprise  those  areas  or  situation; 
where: 

a.  There  is  a  minimum  depth  of  recent  bay  mud: 
underlying  the  proposed  fill  so  that  the  fill  is  not  sub- 
ject to  significant  settlements  and/or  differential  settle- 
ments under  either  static  or  seismic  loads. 

b.  The  underlying  material  is  not  subject  to  lique 
faction  under  seismic  loads. 

c.  The  proposed  fill  and  its  underlying  material  an 
not  subject  to  significant  slumping,  and/or  lurching 
and/or  slides  under  either  static  or  dynamic  loads. 

d.  The  area  is  not  in  an  active  fault  zone  or  in  ex 
tensions  of  active  fault  zones. 

Zone  II — Moderate  Risk 

This  zone  would  comprise  those  areas  or  situation 
where: 

a.  There  is  such  a  depth  of  recent  bay  muds  unde 
lying  the  proposed  fill,  that  substantial  settlement  and 
or  significant  differential  settlements  may  be  expecte&lt; 
under  either  static  or  seismic  loads. 

b.  The  underlying  material  is  not  subject  to  lique 
faction  under  seismic  loads. 

c.  The  fill  and  its  underlying  material  are  not  sut 
ject  to  significant  slumping,  and/or  lurching,  and/c 
slides. 

d.  The  area  is  not  in  an  active  fault  zone  or  in 
tensions  of  active  fault  zones. 

Zone  III — Substantial  Risk 

This  zone  would  comprise  those  areas  or  situation 
where: 

a.  There  is  such  a  depth  of  recent  bay  muds  undei 
lying  the  proposed  fill,  that  substantial  settlement  and

nder  either  static  or  dynamic  loads. 

b.  The  underlying  material  is  subject  to  liquefaction 
l  only  local  areas  adjacent  to  sloughs  and  other  fea-

nd/or  slide. 

d.  The  area  is  not  in  an  active  fault  zone,  or  in  ex- 
snsions  of  fault  zones. 

!one  IV — Maximum  Risk 
This  zone  includes  those  areas  or  situations  where: 

a.  There  are  deep  compressible  bay  muds  where 
lajor  settlements  or  differential  settlements  are  prob- 
ble,  unless  suitable  precautions  are  taken  to  bring  the 
;ttlements  within  acceptable  limits  under  static  or 
;ismic  loads. 

b.  The  areas  are  adjacent  to  channels  where  abrupt 
hanges  in  the  topography  are  combined  with  struc- 
jrally  questionable  foundation  materials. 

c.  Formerly  uncontrolled  dump  areas  exist. 

d.  The  area  is  within  known  active  fault  zones  or 
l  extensions  of  active  fault  zones.

Special  Conditions 

If,  for  economic  or  other  reasons,  it  is  desirable  to 
nstruct  a  facility  with  higher  density  of  occupancy 
more  basically  vulnerable  type  of  construction  in 
ligher  risk  zone,  this  can  be  done  (with  certain  ex- 
ptions)  by  making  a  more  extensive  investigation 
d  providing  additional  construction  precautions  as 
heated  by  such  investigations  in  addition  to  those 
:ed  below.  However,  under  circumstances  deemed 
cessary  by  the  Fill  Review  Board,  the  Fill  Review
