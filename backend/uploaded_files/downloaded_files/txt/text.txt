It is the sedimentary cover that lies unconformably on the Precambrian rocks. The sedimentary cover has similar characteristics like loess and comparable to those deposits found in other parts of the world. The laboratory results of edometric and sieve tests indicate this soil is sandy and loam, non-cohesive, collapsible leading to differential settlements between 4.3 and 5.5 cm.<#LINE#>Nzila J.D.
