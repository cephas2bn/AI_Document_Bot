Introduction
This Technical Note is prepared to provide guidance to the World Bank task teams and clients regarding
geological and geotechnical issues and recommended risk mitigation and management measures. The
investigation, design, and construction of dams should identify and consider all potential hazards and
threats to dam safety while being cognizant of the associated consequences of dam failure.


Geotechnical Hazards
Geotechnical hazards1 and threats for a dam must be considered for the overall dam system including
dam body, appurtenant structures, foundations, abutments, and the reservoir rim. Critical hazards and
threats that could lead to dam failure include:

•• Internal erosion and piping of embankment or foundation material


•• Hydraulic fracturing within the dam


•• Surface erosion


•• Slope instability


•• Static and dynamic liquefaction of foundation soils or the embankment fill


•• Excessive seepage



1	 Hazard is here defined as a threat or condition that may result from external cause (for example, earthquake or flood) or internal vulnera-
   bility. Risk is defined by combining an assessment of the probability of the hazard occurring with an assessment of the impact that the
   hazard would cause if it occurs. More details are provided in the Geotechnical Risk Register section.




Technical Note 2: Geotechnical Risk                                                                                                         1
•• Excessive uplift pressure


•• Deformation of the dam


•• Sliding on weak foundation planes


•• Unsuitable construction materials



Geological Hazards
Geotechnical hazards are derived from and linked with broader geological hazards surrounding dam
sites and reservoir areas. Geologically, no two sites will be the same; many different geological
­
processes and interactions can create complex sites and the materials available for dam construction.
Geology will have a profound influence on the location of the dam site and layout of dam features.
Geological hazards are those geological features that have the potential to negatively affect the
successful construction of a dam at the chosen site. Geological hazards may affect the selection of
­
dam sites and surrounding reservoir areas. The successful project will identify geological hazards
and, where necessary, mitigate the effects that hazards could bring on the construction and operation
of dams and reservoirs.

Geological hazards may include:

•• Defects in rock foundations including joints, bedding planes, faults, infill seams, solution features,
    buried alluvial channels, and weathered or altered seams, which could become leakage paths or form
    unstable wedges in the dam foundation


•• Defects in soil foundations including fissures, tension cracks, ancient landslides, and infilled
    features


•• Potentially liquefiable foundation soils that would not support the dam body after an earthquake


•• Soluble foundation rock that leads to leakage and erosion problems over time


•• Varying stiffness of foundation material that could result in differential settlement within the dam


•• Potentially unstable abutment slopes


•• Potentially unstable slopes surrounding the reservoir shoreline that could cause an impulse wave that
    could overtop the dam


•• Foundation material that is prone to erosion and scouring by energy dissipation of discharge from the
    dam spillway


•• High-pressure groundwater systems that prevent foundation excavation and construction



2      Technical Note 2: Geotechnical Risk
•• Chemically reactive aggregates that affect construction materials (for example, aggregates that would
  cause expansion cracks in concrete by alkali aggregate reaction or an earth dam filter material that
  cements)


•• Active regional faults that could cause earthquakes resulting in severe shaking and displacements at
  or near the dam site


•• Active faults that cross the reservoir or dam site with the potential to cause seiche waves in the reser-
  voir that could overtop the dam


Geological hazards must be assessed using data obtained during geotechnical investigations, supple-
mented by geologists and geotechnical engineers’ judgments and analysis. Mitigation measures need to
be considered to reduce the effects of the hazard or reduce the likelihood of occurrence. If the risk would
remain unacceptably high even after mitigation measures are taken, then the dam site may have to be
abandoned.


Foundation Conditions
Foundation defects can affect the integrity and stability of any dam type, and untreated foundation
defects have contributed to some dam failures around the world. The foundation of any dam must fulfill
the following five functions:

•• It must provide stability.


•• It must provide adequate stiffness to ensure that deformations are within acceptable limits.


•• It must control and limit seepage flows and uplift/piezometric pressures beneath the dam.


•• It must be resistant to internal erosion.


•• It must not degrade over time.


Appropriate foundation engineering should address any concerns that arise in relation to these
functions.

At some dam sites, geological conditions are reasonably straightforward, and all of the functions are
readily satisfied. At other dam sites, geological conditions are complex, and critical defects may not
become apparent until foundation excavation is underway. The challenge is to keep the uncertainties
within acceptable limits; however, there are some geological environments that require more care
during investigation, design, and construction.




Technical Note 2: Geotechnical Risk                                                                       3
Annex 1 of Environmental and Social Standard (ESS) 4 specifies that a dam featuring “foundations that
are complex and difficult to prepare” should apply certain dam safety requirements regardless of the
dam’s size. These foundation complexities and issues can include:

•• Clean coarse sands, gravels, and cobbles that could provide a pathway for foundation piping or the
    piping of embankment materials into the foundation


•• Loose silt or sand deposits that are potentially liquefiable


•• Open or infilled joints in foundation rock that could be eroded and provide the potential for high
    leakage flows or the piping of embankment materials


•• Interbedded soil deposits (fine against coarse) that could provide the potential for foundation piping


•• Weak strata, interbeds, and seams with low strengths, which could result in potential sliding failure
    surfaces within the foundation


•• Persistent subhorizontal joint sets that would limit the shear strength at the dam/foundation inter-
    face or within the dam foundation


•• Faults and other major discontinuities that can incorporate low-strength materials and, if unfavoura-
    bly orientated, affect dam stability


•• Highly compressible or dispersive soils that could result in collapse, differential settlements, and
    cracking or foundation piping


•• Karst features (caves and sinkholes) in limestone or soluble foundations (for example, gypsum),
    which can result in significant leakage and additional sinkholes following reservoir impoundment by
    dissolution or washing out of infilling or overlying materials


•• Active faults that can cause earthquakes, resulting in displacements beneath a dam and the initiation
    of internal erosion, increased uplift pressures, and reductions in dam stability (see the Technical Note
    on Seismic Risk)


•• Landslides or unstable abutments


Reservoir Rim Stability and Watertightness
In addition to the dam foundation and abutment, geotechnical issues of the reservoir rim should also be
assessed.

Reservoir Rim Stability
The potential of landslides on the reservoir rim should be checked as part of the dam’s safety
evaluation. The reservoir landslides could cause an impulse wave generated by rapid landslide move-
­
ment (or rockfall) to overtop the dam or flood the communities surrounding the reservoir rim.


4      Technical Note 2: Geotechnical Risk
Alternatively, a landslide around the reservoir rim or in the upstream river, could create a “landslide
dam”, blocking the river flow/reservoir water and eventually breaching with the resulting flood wave
overtopping the dam.

ICOLD (2002) provides guidelines for the investigation and management of reservoir landslides, com-
ments on possible risk mitigation measures, and discusses requirements and methods for the ongoing
monitoring of reservoir landslide performance.

Considerations for landslides around the reservoir rim include:

•• Whether there is any part of the reservoir perimeter (for example, a narrow ridge) that may be more
  likely to fail than the closure dam


•• Whether there is any potential for landslide-generated waves to affect communities adjacent to the
  reservoir


•• Whether any existing landslides may reactivate or new landslides may develop under any of the pos-
  sible reservoir conditions, to the extent that the dam could be overtopped or the reservoir or ups-
  tream tributaries blocked


•• Whether reservoir operation could result in toe erosion adjacent to dormant or potential landslide
  areas


•• Whether any of the slopes near the spillway or low-level outlet facilities may fail and block the facili-
  ties or impair their functions


•• What management regimen should be implemented to prevent sediment or debris from affecting the
  performance of the spillway or low-level outlet facilities


•• What operational requirements should be implemented to ensure that the stability of dormant and
  potential landslide areas is not adversely affected by reservoir drawdown


•• What management regimen should be implemented to monitor the performance of known landslides
  and any completed remedial works during dam commissioning and operation


Reservoir Water Tightness
The water tightness of a reservoir depends on the permeability of foundation and surrounding material,
existing groundwater around the reservoir, and gradients and lengths of potential seepage paths.
Although minor reservoir water leakage will not cause dam safety and operation issues, a large amount
of leakage can have several negative impacts. Excessive leakage could prevent the reservoir from being
filled up and cause increased groundwater tables, leading to development of swamps downstream or
landslides. Leakage water could exit to a downstream location in an uncontrolled manner, eroding the
surrounding ground or dam structure.




Technical Note 2: Geotechnical Risk                                                                       5
The leakage rate will depend on the geological formation and material type surrounding the reservoir.
Nonsoluble, soluble, and soil materials will have different levels of watertightness. Keys to understan-
ding the watertightness of nonsoluble and soluble rocks include understanding the groundwater condi-
tions around the reservoir and the site’s history, regional topography, geology, and properties of
materials surrounding the reservoir.

There are several treatment measures to prevent and reduce leakage, such as lining the reservoir, grou-
ting, construction of cutoff walls, and so on. Because these treatment works could be quite expensive, it
is important to undertake proper geological and geotechnical investigation and assess the costs of the
treatment works to reduce the leakage amount to an acceptable level. The dam site may need to be ree-
valuated depending on such assessments.


Dam Type Selection and Key Factors
Dams are primarily constructed of “earthfill” (soil and rock) materials or concrete. The appropriate dam
type and construction materials will depend on several factors, including the purpose and geological
considerations. Table 1 shows the significant factors that should be considered for specific dam types to
minimize dam safety hazards, along with possible design and mitigation measures that address the
potential failure modes.

Some good reference books and guidelines on the design and remediation of dams include:

•• Weaver and Bruce (2007) for foundation grouting

•• Fell et al. (2005) for geotechnical engineering of dams.

•• ICOLD (2005) for dam foundations including geologic considerations, investigation methods, treat-
    ment and monitoring

•• ICOLD (2009) for the specification and quality control of concrete dams

•• FEMA (2011) for embankment dam filters

•• USBR (1987) for design of small dams



Investigation Program
Comprehensive geotechnical investigations should be undertaken to understand the dam’s foundation
stratigraphy, design, and construction materials. All investigations and data assembly for the design
must be on an appropriate level to the complexity of the dam site. Site investigations can be long, so it is
important to start as soon as possible. Investigation needs to be in proportion to the hazard of the struc-
ture and the magnitude of the risk. There can be a temptation to delay investigation activities until the
implementation phase, but by then the construction contract will have been signed and unexpected
ground conditions are more likely to become the source of contractual dispute. Investigations should be
preferably staged so that lessons learned guide the scope for subsequent stages of investigation.

8       Technical Note 2: Geotechnical Risk
Investigations can be costly, but it is highly important to invest time and money in a phased manner to
avoid surprises, even though it may be difficult to convince the client to spend money at the early pro-
ject preparation stage. Investigation costs will depend on the complexity of the site and the nature of
materials available. The risk rating of the structure should also be a factor in prudent investment in
investigation to protect downstream communities. The greater the investment in well-planned investi-
gation, the more likely geotechnical risks can be identified and mitigated, rather than being the reason
for cost overruns later in the project. Major changes to design have occurred following the discovery of
unforeseen ground conditions at some projects.2

It is also worth noting that investigation costs are often dominated by the cost to access the site and
mobilize the equipment. The incremental costs of additional investigations once the initial investment
has been made may be low relative to the access costs.

Most investigation programs are completed in a series of separate stages with the following objectives:

•• A prefeasibility investigation to gain sufficient information for the planning of a feasibility investiga-
   tion. At this stage the project would likely identify possible dam sites, dam types, or possible remedial
   measures. The dam’s setting would be established in the regional geological and geomorphological
   context. Site reconnaissance, Google Earth, satellite images, regional geological mapping, and data
   searches would be used, but there may not be significant physical site investigations until a preferred
   site has been selected and a preferred dam type determined. It is important at the early stage to have
   technical experts visit the proposed site to assess its suitability.

•• A feasibility investigation to identify the preferred solution, confirm the technical feasibility of the
   preferred solution, and estimate the cost of project development. At this stage the site conditions
   would be established and local hazards identified. With a site identified, Lidar imagery provides base-
   line topographic detail that an experienced geologist can use to identify potential faults and landsli-
   des. Geological mapping and an initial subsurface investigation (boreholes, permeability test,
   geophysical investigation, and laboratory testing of samples) would be expected. These investiga-
   tions would focus on identifying geological hazards in the dam foundations and surrounding vicinity,
   the presence of suitable construction materials in volumes necessary for construction, and whether
   dam and reservoir hazards are present.

•• A design investigation to determine specific details of the site and the materials for construction, and
   to address any outstanding issues raised by earlier investigations. Targeted physical investigations
   using boreholes, geophysical investigation, and laboratory testing of samples would be expected to
   carefully assess features, defects, and anomalies for the dam foundation and spillway location, the
   geotechnical properties (strength, gradation, compressibility, compatibility, and permeability) of the
   foundation and the construction materials, and the threat posed by any active faults and reservoir
   slope hazards.


2	 Research of 40 dams in Australia built between 1888 and 2012 showed consequential project cost overruns of 49 percent (median) and
  120 percent (mean) of the dam cost (estimated immediately prior to construction), with ground conditions being significant contributors
  to the overruns (Petheram and McMahon 2019).

The geotechnical investigation technique and purpose at different stages are summarized in table 2.
ICOLD (2005) also provides an overview of investigation techniques to address geological situations.

All investigation programs should be progressively implemented to ensure that all unknowns are pro-
perly identified and addressed. An appropriate process for the completion of an investigation program
involves:

1.	 Clearly defining the investigation objectives


2.	Reviewing existing information and the identification of information gaps


3.	Planning an investigation program

Consulting Engineers (FIDIC) Red Book contract is normally used when the designer is engaged by the
client. It assigns geological and geotechnical risks differently from the FIDIC Silver Book contract for
Engineer, Procure, Construct (EPC). FIDIC Emerald Book (2019) also provides the risk allocation mecha-
nism related to unforeseen ground conditions, particularly for tunnelling projects.3

Investigations should be undertaken by appropriate and competent geologists and engineers who are
skilled in the type of structure and the type of geological conditions expected at the site. Geologists will
carry out the field activities, map the site, and identify hazards. They should be skilled in dam investi-
gations rather than other fields such as mining or road works. Engineers need to be experienced in dam
design and dam engineering, rather than other fields of engineering, to use the geotechnical properties
for dam design. It is important that the engineers develop a clear understanding of the geological model
delivered by the geologists.


Geotechnical Reports and Baselines
Documenting geotechnical information is vital to ensure that developing knowledge of the project
­
geology, hydrogeology, natural hazards, and engineering materials is being retained for the record and
passed on to other parties participating in the project. This approach will reduce the risk of errors and
omissions as the project advances. Furthermore, documented geotechnical details become the baseline
evidence during contractual disputes between the constructor and the dam owner.

A geological summary report may be sufficient for low-risk dams that are on relatively straightforward
foundations and constructed of reliable materials. The report should describe the site in the context of
regional geology, the specifics of site geology, and any known geological hazards that could affect the
site (for example, faults or landslides). This information should be available from regional maps, sate-
llite imagery, site inspection, and preliminary site investigations such as test pits.

The following are logical allocations of documentation for high-risk dams, those on complex founda-
tions, or those constructed of challenging materials. The purpose and recommended content of


3	 FIDIC (2017a) is known as the Red Book, FIDIC (2017b) is known as the Yellow Book, and FIDIC (2017c) is known as the Silver Book. The
  Emerald Book provides a standard-form contract that caters to the specificities of the tunnelling industry providing provision for the risk
  allocation mechanism of unforeseen ground conditions between contractual parties and disclosure of geological and geotechnical informa-
  tion with the use of the Geotechnical Baseline Report (GBR). This key document sets out the allocation of risk between contractor and
  employer for subsurface physical conditions in providing the contractual definition of foreseeable conditions. The Emerald Book also pro-
  vides a more flexible mechanism for completion time delay and price adjustment related to ground conditions as well as multitier dispute
  resolution mechanism.

geotechnical reports is described in ASCE (2007). This document structure originated in the tunnelling
industry to reduce the instances of expensive contract disputes over ground conditions. Dam projects
have many geotechnical risks that, in the contract environment, have the potential for expensive con-
tract disputes as well. Hence, the similar approach of report presentation is recommended for dam pro-
jects and fits well with FIDIC-type contract documents (FIDIC 2017 a, b, and c).

The following are more-specific geotechnical reports that would be required and useful for large cons-
truction contracts and / or high-risk dams.

•• Geotechnical Data Reports (GDRs), prepared by geologists, are factual reports containing raw data
     such as borehole logs and laboratory results. If geotechnical hazards are known, they should also be
     included. GDRs are intended to provide enough information to reduce the risk for projects and trans-
     fer information to the contractor.


•• Geotechnical Baseline Reports (GBRs), based on GDRs prepared by geologists, are instrumental in defi-
     ning anticipated ground conditions during contract pricing. When the GBR is part of the construction
     contract, it sets the range of adverse physical ground conditions that ought to be provided for and
     included in the contract price. The GBR should provide a summary of anticipated ground and ground-
     water conditions of a potential work site for the purpose of understanding the risk for preparing pro-
     posals and bids for projects. The GBR may save construction costs and minimize disputes in unforeseen
     ground conditions.


•• Geotechnical Interpretative Reports (GIRs) are prepared by a team of qualified engineers and geologists
     to apply the factual report to geotechnical analysis. Expert judgment is necessary in developing con-
     clusions in these reports.


The geologist should focus on geological information (description and foundation parameters) and
identification of geological hazards and conditions to be expected. The design of the dam is carried out
by the engineer, who should pay close attention to the engineering properties of the materials being
investigated. Once the dam foundation has been stripped and exposed, the excavation findings should
be compiled into a report and compared with the GBR.

Preparation of these reports is a good opportunity to build capacity in local engineering and geological
institutions and their staff.

The detail and availability of these reports should consider the construction contract model. Contract
documents should clearly express the risk allocated to the dam owner and to the contractor. In a unit
rate contract, the usual risk-sharing principle is that ground condition risk is carried by the owner and
production rates are within the risk sphere of the contractor. Therefore, any unexpected ground condi-
tion requiring greater excavation, ground treatment, structural support, or replacement not identified
in the design will be the dam owner’s cost to pay. An adequate amount of contingency should be alloca-
ted to provide the financial means to address unexpected conditions. The geotechnical reports should




12      Technical Note 2: Geotechnical Risk
identify what is known and therefore informs the contractor of the conditions to expect. If the dam
owner has strong internal capacity and a capable designer, then the GBR information is desirable as a
baseline for contractual claims of unforeseen ground conditions. Challenging ground conditions would
make the GBR far more important than a site with a consistent good-quality dam foundation. Strong
capability within the owner and their designer is more important when more complex site conditions
are present.

If the dam owner cannot manage the contract, they should engage an experienced owner’s engineer for
assistance. A panel of experts including a geologist/geotechnical specialist and potentially including
experts with construction supervision and contract management expertise may be considered for high-
risk dams with complex geotechnical conditions. The dam owner may wish to transfer the ground con-
dition risk by using a lump sum contract, design/build contract, engineer, procure, construct (EPC), or
turnkey contract, but the dam owner needs to understand and accept that in these cases the contractor
will either include a large amount of contingency in the lump sum price or insist on investigating the site
themselves before providing a fixed price. For these contracts, it is especially important to hand over all
geotechnical investigation information (that is, GDR, GBR, and any GIRs) compiled by the owner before
negotiating the contract. It is then up to the contractor to satisfy themselves of the geotechnical risks on
the site.


Geotechnical Risk Register
A Geotechnical Risk Register (GRR) is recommended for every project. The GRR shows the degree of risk
attached to various ground-related aspects of the project. The purpose of the GRR is to provide an
assessment of the risk to the project posed by ground- or construction material-related problems and
identify suitable mitigation measures that would control the risk to an acceptable level. The risk register
should be developed and refined as the geotechnical design and assessment progresses. Guidance on
development of GRRs is presented in several references, including ICE (2001).

The degree of risk (R) is determined by combining an assessment of the probability (P) of the hazard
occurring with an assessment of the impact (I) that the hazard4 will cause if it occurs (R = P x I). Table 3
shows the scale against which the probability and impact are measured and the resulting degree of risk
determined.

Table 4 provides an example risk register for a concrete dam with an embankment saddle dam.

A probability of “very unlikely” indicates a condition that the available data suggests should not be pre-
sent. The inclusion of a risk in the register does not constitute confirmation that the problem exists at
the site, but it identifies the risk that the mitigation will be required to enable the project to progress.



4	 Whilst hazard is used as a measure of consequences in case of dam failure as per dams engineering practice in other sections of this
  Technical Note, hazard is here defined as a threat or condition that may result from external cause (for example, an earthquake or flood) or
  internal vulnerability.

Investigation should lead to design of mitigation measures to reduce significant geotechnical risks.
Should the employer realise that objective difficulties and schedule constraints have not allowed to do
that satisfactorily, it can include provision for a condition delay event (CDE) in the contract. CDE process
is as follows:

•• During the mobilization period, the contractor carries out additional investigations and conveys their
      results to the employer with proposed design modifications.

•• The employer reviews the submission and instructs the contractor on what to implement or not.

•• Conclusions are summarized in a report and the contract’s bill of quantities (BoQ) is revised
      accordingly.



14             Technical Note 2: Geotechnical Risk
Construction may still uncover previously unidentified geotechnical issues. It is important that issues
are addressed whenever identified. Such geotechnical issues should be addressed by design changes or
application of contingency measures planned in advance of construction. Contracts should allow for
changes in response to geotechnical risks identified during construction. Associated contractor’s claims
would be managed according to contractual provisions.

If conditions are shown to be unacceptable through these means, then further mitigation measures may
be necessary to address remaining safety issues. These measures might include:

•• Improved drainage to relieve pressure and filters to control seepage gradients


•• Remedial grouting to reduce pressure or leakage


•• Lowering the reservoir level to reduce load on the dam or reduce the potential consequence downs-
  tream of the dam


•• Constructing buttresses to prevent further deformation


The acceptable residual risk after the identified risk has been mitigated would depend on the potential
economic impacts on the project and downstream consequence considering the dam’s risk category.
The residual risks may be addressed by:

•• Surveillance, instrumentation, and monitoring during construction, commissioning, and operation
  of dams


•• Operation and maintenance (O&M) procedures suited to the dam and documented in an O&M plan


•• Readily available Emergency Preparedness Plans (EPPs)
